        "date": "Thu Nov  5 22:20:44 2020",
        "body": "Minor League Cricket (MiLC) is delighted to announce the winners of a number of individual awards following the conclusion of the Franchise Exhibition Matches that were staged throughout the United States over six weekends during September and October.\n\nThese matches would not have been possible without the commitment of players, all 24 team owners, and the support of the wider USA Cricket community. Both MiLC and USA Cricket want to thank all stakeholders involved from across the cricketing community for their contributions in delivering these matches safely and successfully, with more T20 games completed than ever before at this level in the United States.\n\nFranchise Exhibition Match Summary\n\nThe Franchise Exhibition Matches saw the very best amateur cricketers across the United States, as well as 36 First-Class and international players, produce competitive and highly entertaining cricket.\n\nThis ambitious project broke new ground for American cricket – 51 matches were played across 17 different venues, with 15,593 runs scored and 657 wickets taken, with matches covered on www.majorleaguecricket.com. Of the more than 2,400 players who originally registered for the MiLC Draft, 364 players were selected to make up 18 squads and 312 players took the field in at least one match.\n\nTestament to the competitive nature was the closeness of a number of matches. In total, there were 14 final over finishes, 2 final ball finishes and 2 tied matches which led to super overs. Nine centuries were scored, along with 4 five wicket hauls and even the remarkable feat of 6 consecutive sixes in an over from Chandrapaul Hemraj.\n\nA key objective of Minor League Cricket is to provide young talent an opportunity to develop and showcase their talent, which was accomplished with 90 players aged 21 and under selected as part of MiLC squads in 2020. Seventy-one of those players took the field in an average of 3 matches, including a host of breakout performances that suggest the future of USA Cricket is in safe hands.\n\nMVP Awards\n\nMiLC is delighted to announce the winners of a number of individual awards in recognition of notable performances that were seen throughout the league in 2020.\n\nThe MVP of each conference will receive a $1,000 prize, whilst the Best Batsman & Best Bowler in each conference will receive $500 rewards, respectively. The following players produced consistent and standout performances across the Exhibition Matches:\n\nAward Western Eastern Southern Central MVP ($1,000) Sanjay Krishnamurthi Assad Fudadin Darpan Patel Rameez Raja Best\n\nBatter ($500)\n\nNarsingh Deonarine Dominique Rikhi Rishi Bhardwaj Shaheer Hasan Best\n\nBowler ($500)\n\nRusty Theron Bruce Blackwood Rohan Phadke Nosthush Kenjige\n\nEast Bay Blazers all-rounder Sanjay Krishnamurthi edged out some high-quality competition to take home the overall MVP award for the 2020 Franchise Exhibition Matches, along with the associated $4,000 prize. Sanjay, who has been supported by the Major League Academy Network in the Bay Area, was one of the leading run scorers in the Western Conference and scored 264 runs in 8 matches at an average of 88.00, picking up 4 wickets and two man-of-the-match performances. At just 17 years of age, this is a significant achievement given the competitive nature of these matches, and he has certainly announced himself as a name to watch out for in the future.\n\nInaugural Season of Minor League Cricket in 2021\n\nHaving successfully developed a nationwide 24 team competition structure, the focus now turns to taking the learnings from the Franchise Exhibition Matches and building on this platform ahead of the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket in 2021.\n\nPlanning is well underway for the 2021 season, with the prospect of more teams being added and a full home and away season culminating in Conference and National Playoffs. The inaugural season of Minor League Cricket is set to commence next year in Spring 2021.\n\nJustin Geale of American Cricket Enterprises and Tournament Director of Minor League Cricket was pleased with everyone’s efforts in a difficult year, “We are really delighted with the outcome despite the challenges the country is experiencing at the moment. We are thankful to all of the owners, players, the Minor League Governing Council (including its Chair, Atul Rai, and other members), as well as the officials and volunteers who went above and beyond to ensure we were able to get cricket played safely across the country. The reaction and interest from the community has been hugely positive, and with all the learnings gleaned from this year, we strongly believe the format and structure is going to be a success. We look forward to having the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket in 2021 and building upon the platform we created this year.”\n\nUSA Cricket Chief Executive, Iain Higgins commented, “USA Cricket is very pleased with the results of Minor League Cricket in 2020, especially given all of the challenges that our partners at ACE have had to navigate through the COVID pandemic. To get the inaugural Draft completed, team owners appointed and more than 50 games safely played across a wide number of jurisdictions has been a fantastic effort. On behalf of USA Cricket, our thanks go to everyone involved both at MiLC and the broader cricket community for embracing this important concept. The quality of cricket was very strong, and the performances from the younger generation of players across all of the teams bodes extremely well for the future.”",

        "title": "2023 Minor League Cricket Final: Kenjige, Sheikh lead Mustangs past Cavaliers",
        "date": "Wed Oct  4 00:54:32 2023",
        "body": "It might have been 88 degrees fahrenheit at game time in Grand Prairie, Texas, but the ebbs and flows of the scorecard could convince league followers that this Minor League Cricket Final occurred in the east. And for the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers to have a chance to defeat the favored Dallas Mustangs, they needed to muddy up the game enough to resemble a typical Eastern Division street fight.\n\nThe Somerset Cavaliers journey to the league final was gritty and audacious, but more than anything, it was unlikely.\n\nAfter starting the regular season 1-2-1, the Cavaliers closed out with five wins and one loss to finish tied for third with the New England Eagles in points. Since the Eagles held the tiebreaker, thanks to a 2-0 record head to head, the Cavaliers season could have been finished. Only three teams from the East were meant to advance to the postseason. But two forfeits on the final weekend of regular season play from division rival Empire State Titans clouded the playoff picture.\n\nApparently unable to finance the rest of the season or pay their players, the Titans cut their season short, giving New England two free wins. Thankfully, for those who prefer things to be settled on the field, the Eagles and the Cavaliers played a winner take all playoff, and the Cavs came out on top by 66 runs to claim sole possession of third place.\n\nWhile this was the Cavs’ first playoff berth in Minor League Cricket, few could doubt their ability to beat any team on their day. In 2021, the Cavs finished sixth in the East Division, though they set a league record with a 252 run explosion in Atlanta in just their second MiLC match. In 2022, the Cavs again finished sixth, winning only four of 14 games, though all four wins came consecutively. The 2023 edition was stacked with current and former USA national team players, and players with First Class and List A experience.\n\nIn the Eliminator round, Somerset would defeat the New Jersey Stallions, a team that had made it to Finals Weekend in each of the last two seasons. With the Stallions nine down and trailing by six with one ball remaining, Sachin Mylavarapu came to the crease and smashed the final delivery over the rope to force an unlikely super over. Kennar Lewis unceremoniously sent the Cavaliers to the Super Four with a maximum just three balls into the super over chase. Again, it wasn’t pretty, but the Cavaliers found a way to move on.\n\nStill, few would have predicted the sustained form the Cavs would ride to advance to the league final. Especially after the first Super Four “result”.\n\nThough they won the first Super Four game between the lines, it was ruled a forfeit, due to the inclusion of Chanderpaul Hemraj in the Cavaliers playing eleven. League rules state that for a player to be classified as a domestic, that player must either meet the requirements for USA national team eligibility, or he must retire from his home nation, declare the intention to qualify for USA (not necessarily the intention to represent USA), and then continue to follow the necessary pathway to qualification. Hemraj, who started the 2023 season as a domestic for the Cavaliers, left to represent Guyana as a domestic in the Caribbean Premier League. This put Hemraj outside of Minor League Cricket’s requirements for domestic qualification when he returned.\n\nPrior to the start of their first Super Four game against the Philadelphians, the league informed the Cavaliers that if they were to proceed with both Hemraj and Kennar Lewis in the playing eleven, they’d forfeit the game. Per league rules, only two players not qualified as domestics can play in the same playing eleven. The Cavaliers failed to heed the warning and submitted a team sheet with both players listed. The game was still played, per league rules as an exhibition, but points were awarded to Philly.\n\nWhile the forfeit launched their single round robin Super Four campaign with zero points, there was no Net Run Rate penalty applied – unlike in the case of Empire State Titans, who had 20 overs and zero runs added to their league batting totals for each of their two forfeits. With no NRR hit applied, and after defeating the Atlanta Lightning in their second game by 6 wickets with 33 balls to spare, the 1-1 Cavaliers would only need to defeat the 2-0 Atlanta Fire, last year’s Atlantic Champs, to advance to the League Final.\n\nThanks largely to USA Cricket veteran Gajanand Singh’s 72 from 35, the Cavaliers did enough to get past Atlanta by 11 runs and advance to Grand Prairie and represent the Atlantic Conference.\n\nThe Dallas Mustangs could be considered the home team of this Championship Final, thanks to their namesake as well as their collective experience at the ground. While only one member of New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers had prior experience at Grand Prairie Stadium (Gajanand Singh, with LA Knight Riders of MLC), the Dallas Mustangs had played four league games with Grand Prairie as their home ground.\n\nA reasonable favorite to win the league from the start of the season, the Mustangs featured eight Major Leaguers on their roster, most of whom were coming off of relatively successful MLC campaigns. Nauman Anwar and Corey Anderson were the top two performing domestic batters in Major League Cricket, Andries Gous helped his Washington Freedom into the playoffs, and USA’s Nosh Kenjige was a key roleplayer for the league champion MI New York franchise. Nosh was joined in the New York side by former Pakistan pacer Ehsan Adil and 2021 MiLC MVP Hammad Azam. Sujith Gowda didn’t see action with the Freedom, but has scored over 1200 runs in Minor League Cricket, and USA Cricket young gun Ali Sheikh was the LA Knight Riders U23 selection.\n\nThe Mustangs took a much more traditional path to the league final. They simply won their division outright with an 8-2 record with the best NRR in the Pacific and then swept the Pacific Super Four group stage with a +2.26 NRR. Though they were without Corey Anderson, who averaged over 75 with a strike rate of 187 during the regular season, the Mustangs faced little trouble in the Super Fours, and entered the final on an eight game winning streak with eventual league MVP Andries Gous at the top of his game.\n\nBut that was before Sunday’s street fight.\n\nNajaf Shah set the tone against Dallas’s star opening pair of Gous and Nauman Anwar. Shah, who played for the Mustangs in 2021, had captained the Cavaliers from the first game of the 2022 season, but missed the first half of 2023 with an injury. The Cavaliers’ red hot run coincided with his return to the team.\n\nTwo runs from the first six balls demonstrated that swing and seam would play a serious role in the outcome of the innings.\n\nJunaid Mahsood’s second ball angled in, beat the dangerous bat of Gous and crashed into off stump to draw first blood for the Cavaliers. As the first four overs played out with Mahsood and Shah, the Gous wicket felt bigger and bigger. Adil Bhatti entered the attack with the usually galloping Mustangs barely trotting at 21/1, with six of those runs coming from extras.\n\nBowling mostly a wider line at length and swinging the ball away, Bhatti found the outside edges of Sujith Gowda and Anwar, both caught behind. By the time Bhatti concluded his incredible spell of four overs, two wickets and only four runs conceded, the Mustangs were in a 47/5 hole after 11.\n\nThe fourth and fifth wickets were equally important, courtesy of leggie Sunny Patel. With the third ball of the tenth over, Hamad Azam took a greedy whack at a full delivery on the line of his heel, but struck it hard and flat right down Syed Abdullah’s throat at deep backward point.\n\nBut Ali Sheikh and Nosh Kenjige would show that the Cavaliers weren’t the only team with grit, as they crafted a 56 run partnership to give the Mustangs a fighting chance. Sheikh demonstrated his trademark confidence, smashing 36 from 25 when that kind of production seemed like nothing more than a hope and a prayer, before finally falling caught and bowled to Mahsood with 13 balls left in the innings and the Mustangs at 106/6.\n\nPrathamesh Pawar thumped 11 from 5, but found himself stranded at the non-striker end in the 20th over as the Mustangs lost their seventh and eighth wickets. A final ball two from Ehsan Adil set the total at 121/8.\n\nSurely the Mustangs had their work cut out for them in the chase. Surely they’d need to take early wickets and limit the run rate early if they wanted to win the game.\n\nNursing an injured knee, Ehsan Adil was whacked for 23 runs in his first two overs, as Kennar Lewis muscled the Cavaliers to 30/0 after three. Six more runs on byes didn’t help the cause. But lefty quick Rumman Raees was up to the challenge and conceded only three runs from his first two overs to limit the damage. But on the first ball of his third over, the sixth of the chase, Raees finally conceded a boundary, as Lewis smashed a full, straight delivery on fourth stump line deep to midwicket for six.\n\nThe Cavaliers looked destined for victory, sitting at 44 without loss with five deliveries remaining in the power play. The early strikes that the Mustangs needed were evading them.\n\nRaees would have his revenge on the very next ball, pitching full on leg stump line to beat Lewis’s bat and get the red hot slugger LBW for 27 runs from 18. Ten balls later, with Nosh Kenjige five balls deep into a maiden over, Katwaroo would gift a catch to long off and the Cavaliers would begin to unravel.\n\nThe pressure of eleven straight dot balls built desperation in the batting pair of USA Cricket heroes Syed Abdullah and Gajanand Singh. On the first ball of the eighth over, Abdullah blocked a Hamad Azam delivery to gully, and Gajanand called for the run. Nosh Kenjige raced in, scooped up the ball, and torpedoed it into the stumps to dismiss Singh for a diamond duck.\n\nKenjige continued his rampage, claiming Abdullah’s wicket in the 9th and Yasir Mohammad’s in the 11th to put the Ccavaliers in a near-identical predicament as the Mustangs had been earlier – 50/5 after 11 overs. Kenjige displayed his talent for coming up big in key moments during the inaugural Major League Cricket season with the ball, and with big catches and runouts in the field. Here in the Minor League Cricket Final, on the same ground as the Major League final, Nosh had just taken the Mustangs almost single-handedly back to a strong position.\n\nAnd while Nosh played a key role in the Mustangs rebound from a collapse in the first innings, the Cavaliers would try to do the same without their own “Nosh”. Like Kenjige, Karima Gore is lauded for his world class fielding, his brave left arm orthodox bowling, and his ability to contribute with the bat. Unfortunately for Somerset, Gore was called for Leeward Island trials ahead of the Super 50 team selection, and so he wasn’t with the Cavaliers on Sunday.\n\nSomerset idled for a couple more overs, until Ehsan Adil bounced back with the wickets of Shawn Findlay and Sunny Patel in the 14th over. Hamad Azam would claim Ghazi and Mahsood in the 16th, and the Cavaliers were finally put out of their misery in the 18th. Adil Bhatti, Somerset’s final desperate hope, was beaten coming back for two by a brilliant throw from U21 Rushil Ugarkar at deep square leg, and the Mustangs dugout erupted onto the field.\n\nFor his efforts to help salvage the innings with the bat, his timely play in the field, and his domination with the ball, Nosthush Kenjige was awarded player of the match.\n\nAndries Gous, who added 161 postseason runs to his 355 in the regular season for a total of 516 runs in 12 innings, was awarded League MVP for 2023. Gous finished the season as league champion for the second consecutive season, having won the league in 2022 with Seattle Thunderbolts.\n\nThree full seasons of Minor League Cricket have now concluded, and though the league continues to face challenges, progress has not been lost on Somerset’s captain, Najaf Shah. “Every season this Minor League is getting better,” Shah said in his post game interview, “American cricket is getting better, and that’s a really good thing for all of us.”\n\nYou’re reading Emerging Cricket — brought to you by a passionate group of volunteers with a vision for cricket to be a truly global sport, and a mission to inspire passion to grow the game.\n\nBe sure to check out our homepage for all the latest news, please subscribe for regular updates, and follow EC on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube.",

        "body": "Billed as the “most extensive competition to ever take place in the United States,” the Toyota Minor League Cricket Championship presented by Sling inaugural opening day is merely hours away. The ambitious American T20 league is the first of its kind in a country that has long occupied the imaginations of those wishing to see cricket reach new heights, especially in terms of commercial appeal.\n\nMuch like baseball’s Minor Leagues, which are a collection of regional leagues, Minor League Cricket’s 27 teams are distributed across 4 divisions, where most of the competition will occur. For two weekends this season, teams will play across divisions within the two conferences, with the South facing the East and the Central facing the West. Also like baseball, Minor League Cricket will eventually feed into an upcoming Major League, with cricket’s version slated for a 2022 exhibition season and a 2023 full launch, likely featuring six teams. Unlike Minor League Baseball, the MiLC is a weekend league, with the majority of players (while paid per game by their team) making their living in various other professions during the work week.\n\nThe league will run from July 31 through October 3, with a total of 218 matches, and over 100 “enhanced streams” in select venues with multiple cameras and commentary. Twelve such games will take place on Saturday, and five more on Sunday, with a total of 24 games for the weekend across nine venues.\n\nBroward County Stadium, the nation’s first approved by the ICC for international play, opens on Saturday as the Ft. Lauderdale Lions face the Empire State Titans at 10am EST. In all, four turf venues will host games this weekend: Broward County Stadium in Lauderhill, Florida; Moosa Stadium in Pearland, Texas; Morgan Hill OSC, in Morgan Hill, CA; and Canyonside Park in San Diego, California.\n\nThe league hopes to play a big part in solving the many problems which have plagued cricket within the United States, including lack of quality venues, lack of opportunities for players transitioning from youth to senior cricket, and perhaps most importantly, the lack of a single NGB supported national domestic competition that connects to individual communities, and that further connects those communities to the national effort..\n\n‘Sometimes even in the smaller cities and towns it can be easier to get that traction, and to get that word of mouth amongst the community,’ Major League Cricket’s Vice President of Marketing, Tom Dunmore, said on the Emerging Cricket Minor League Cricket Show. ‘And if the team does a really good job, and the league does a really good job connecting to people there and reaching out and making people really feel part of growing the sport, make them feel that they can contribute to growing the sport within their own city and also nationwide, you can get that core of support behind you to make you grow, and that can almost be more important than throwing money at billboards or online ads or whatever it may be.\n\n‘If we can build these hubs and these supporters in different spots around the country and showcase what the sport can do, it’s not just a matter of “if you build it, they will come,” you’ve got to do the work to make them come as well and build the community around it.’\n\nAfter eight weeks of regular season games, the top two teams from each division will advance to a playoff, where those eight teams will face off first in a conference semifinal, and then in a conference final and league final, to be held at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina on October 2 and 3. The winning team will take home $250,000.\n\nHow to watch:\n\nMinor League Cricket on YouTube\n\nWillow TV on YouTube\n\nWillow.TV (Subscription)",

        "title": "Americans ready for Minor League Cricket Draft",
        "date": "Fri Jun  4 07:50:52 2021",
        "body": "Minor League Cricket kicks off on July 31 this year, the first official season of what is currently the national domestic cricket competition for men in the USA. Originally scheduled to start in the summer of 2020, the official start was moved to 2021, and a brief exhibition season was played instead.\n\nHeading into the Minor League Cricket Draft on Friday, players around the country are eager to see their names on MiLC rosters. This rings especially true for players in Florida and Southern California. The six teams from these regions were unable to participate in the 2020 exhibition season, due to Covid-19 protocols in their areas.\n\nDavid Pieters was named on the San Diego Surf Riders roster last season and followed the league while his team was amongst those grounded by the pandemic. ‘Was definitely a bit jealous seeing most of the other teams participate last year,’ Pieters told Emerging Cricket. ‘We’ve put in some good work behind the scenes though so happy to get a chance to finally showcase it.’\n\nPieters, who was once on the cusp of USA selection, sees the league as another chance for players like him. ‘I definitely see this as an opportunity to get back in contention for the USA team. Given the fact that the MiLC competition is so strong with professional overseas players contributing to the mix, performances in the league will be highly regarded and will not go unnoticed. I am sure the USA selectors will keep a close eye on how the season unfolds. The MilC provides a central platform to evaluate a player’s ability.’\n\nPieters is likely to see his name on the Surf Riders roster again this season when the teams are announced on Friday. Though the team didn’t play in 2020, strides were made in the San Diego area as a new turf square was installed.\n\n‘There is great talent in Southern California and San Diego and we’ve produced a number of USA players past and present in the region,’ Pieters continued. ‘We are fortunate to have good facilities and strong leadership as well. I know the competition will be tight, especially in this format, and we will have to execute as a unit, but I know we are definitely up for the task. Playing against other divisions across the board is very appealing to me, as different regions have different strengths and weaknesses and different approaches to the game. It provides me with a new challenge where I need to adapt to the playing styles and grounds, especially being a bowler, and in the end makes me a more well rounded player.’\n\nIn Florida, former USA U19 cricketer Dunae Nathaniel eagerly awaits draft results after trying out in front of selectors. ‘The tryout was awesome. Notice was given early and there was a great turnout of the best players in central Florida. I gave everything I had during the tryouts and I hope I impressed the selectors,’ The 34 year old Nathaniel told Emerging Cricket.\n\nTo Dunae, MiLC represents ‘a launching pad and a great opportunity for a lot of local talent who may have been overshadowed in the past to showcase their talents and compete professionally amongst the best cricketers in the country. It is also a platform that the current U19 players can use to launch their career and to pursue cricket as a profession.’\n\nFellow Floridian and fast bowler Kyle Phillip became eligible for USA international selection during the pandemic. At 24 years old, the towering fast bowler is one of the quickest in the country. Having already represented the USA in the Super 50, and featured on the Edmonton Royals in Canada’s GT20, the pandemic has robbed a year from Kyle and players like him just when they’re starting to hit stride.\n\n‘This (MiLC) is big for me,’ Kyle told us. ‘Haven’t played much competitive cricket in an intense environment in a long time so I’m looking forward to this tournament. Can’t wait to get back out there with my teammates and just enjoy this game I miss so much. I also feel as though I still have so much left to prove and achieve.’\n\n‘Being able to rub shoulders with some world class players Corey Anderson, Rusty Theron, these guys have loads of knowledge that could give us a sneak peak into what is required to play the highest level of cricket. For me, personally, when I get around those guys I ask a lot of questions and just be a sponge. Trying to learn as much as possible through their experiences.’\n\nFlorida might be the home of the nation’s first cricket stadium at Central Broward Regional Park, but there’s certainly a feeling of underrepresentation on the national stage. That sentiment has put a chip on the shoulder of local cricketers, which is especially apparent when discussing the topic of interdivisional play.\n\n‘In Florida there’s so much talent that hasn’t been seen yet,’ Phillips explains. ‘There’s the talk going around that our cricket isn’t the best but we are planning to change that narrative and show that we got great talent in the south! Now it’s up to us to showcase our talent. Down here we got guys who are capable of doing great things in key moments. Playing outside our division is what I’m most excited about.’\n\nNathaniel reinforces this emphasis. ‘I think the cricket quality in Florida gets overlooked all the time and people don’t realize how tough the competition is in central Florida and South Florida. Lots of talent and hopefully they will showcase themselves in the Minor League. The fact that you’re playing against teams in other divisions (in MiLC) means you will get to test your skills against different players around the country.’\n\nDraft Day, June 4\n\nRosters will be determined this Friday night as the league announces draft results. The exhibition season of 2020 gave league architect Justin Geale and company a chance to sharpen the game plan for this first official rendition of Minor League Cricket. Below are the details of the roster composition rules and competition format for the 2021 Minor League Cricket season.\n\nEach team is free to select nine players ahead of the draft. Among the nine will be one Wildcard player (can be a player from outside the USA), two Marquee players (“professionals” living in the USA, on the pathway to USA qualification), and three priority domestic players, as well as two under-21 (U21) and one under-19 (U19) players. These nine players will be approved by the league for each team prior to the draft.\n\nWhen an aspiring player registers for the draft, they declare a preferred team. Priority Domestic Players can only be selected by the team a player names. Domestic players not selected prior to the draft are eligible to be drafted by any team in their draft region.\n\nTeams involved in the formal draft will then take turns drafting players listed within their regions until the rosters reach 18 players. Following the draft, and for the first few weeks of the season, teams will have a chance to supplement their rosters with up to two “Free Agents,” defined as any player not drafted by a team, regardless of where that player lives within the USA. Travel costs for these players must be covered by the club, on top of the fixed per-game fee, which could mean this option will be seldom utilized. The intent of the Free Agent spot is to give players who aren’t drafted in their region a chance to play for a team in a region where the talent might not be as strong.\n\nU-19 and U-21\n\nThe importance of inclusion of young players in MiLC has been much discussed since the 2020 exhibition season. Minor League Cricket seem to have adapted their rules slightly this season with hopes to ensure more opportunities for young players.\n\nEvery roster must have at least two U-21 players and one U19 player, and every playing eleven is to have at least one U-19 and one U-21.\n\nNot every city features MiLC-ready talent in these age groups, and some hubs feature a surplus, so it’s likely that some teams will import players from other cities to fill these roles. Enforcement of these rules, along with players being able to play on teams in different cities where need is great, will guarantee that much of the top young talent in the country stays front and center, and also helps to level the playing field for teams in communities where youth cricket isn’t yet strongly developed.\n\nFixed Per-Game Fees for Players\n\nOutside of the Wild Card and Marquee Players, all other player fees are set at a specified amount, according to the player designation. This allows teams to compete with relative parity, and prevents wealthier owners from outbidding other teams for domestic players and stacking their rosters.\n\nFees sorted by player designation:\n\nWild Card and Marquee Players (3 total)- undisclosed, negotiated between the team and the players.\n\nPriority Domestic Player (3 total) – $250\n\nU21 (at least two) – $125\n\nU19 (at least one) – $75\n\nDomestic players (up to 9) – $125\n\nFree Agents (up to 2) – $125, travel paid\n\nLeague Format and Schedule\n\nThree new teams were added to this mix since the exhibition season, with St Louis Americans, Seattle Thunderbolts, and a yet to be named New York City franchise bringing the league to 27 teams.

        "body": "After a summer of regular changes to the Minor League Cricket timetable, the league has finally made an announcement with some permanence. On Saturday USA Cricket announced the 24 franchises and owners of Minor League Cricket, only one of which is listed as fully owned by the league (Sacramento). Team names range from the refreshingly relevant Philadelphians and Morrisville Cardinals, to the curious Atlanta Param Veers, a reference to India’s highest military honour.\n\nThe field of 24 has been announced one week before the new August 22 date for the official Minor League Cricket draft, and includes some notable owners such as former USACA board members, former national team cricketers, CPL franchise owners, and a few LLCs with no names attached. The draft date was recently moved back in order to “provide teams with additional time to evaluate players and allow further planning in advance of the Draft,” per the announcement.\n\nTentative exhibition games are being planned for September and October, perhaps in time for the return of the six ICC Americas players currently in Trinidad for the Caribbean Premier League, depending on Minor League Cricket’s quarantine guidelines. The CPL has taken great measures to ensure the safety of players and staff, requiring overseas players to arrive two weeks prior to the competition and quarantine in their hotels. CPL will stage two games per day between only two Trinidad venues, a bubble approach which will expedite the league schedule and increase viewership in India, due to the earlier local start times and the time zone difference. Minor League Cricket has yet to announce their own Covid-19 related protocols, outside of the fact that travel would be limited to inter-division teams, and that the exhibition “matches will only proceed in conjunction with all local, county, and state authorities’ guidelines.”\n\nThe full list of teams, their cities and owners, as per the USA Cricket release is as follows;\n\nKeep up with news and events happening in the emerging game through our Facebook and Twitter pages.\n\nLooking for audio content on the emerging game?

        "body": "USA Cricket and American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) are pleased to announce today the details of the official Player Registration process for Minor League Cricket, and to give a status update on preparations for the new league.\n\nCricketers across the U.S. will have the opportunity to register for Minor League Cricket, and put their name forward for selection into a Minor League Cricket team for the upcoming season. The Player Registration process opens today on Tuesday, July 7th, continuing for four weeks until the registration deadline on Friday, July 31st, at Midnight PST. The registration process is open to all cricketers based in the U.S. as well as individuals who live abroad and can legally reside in the U.S. for the duration of the season. All players who register by the deadline will be considered for the inaugural Minor League Cricket Player Draft.\n\nThe debut season of Minor League Cricket was due to take place earlier in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the postponement of almost all domestic cricket in the USA from early March onwards. ACE and USA Cricket have been working closely together throughout this period to plan for all potential scenarios and are continuing to assess the likelihood of any cricket activity for drafted Minor League Cricket players in 2020. Ultimately, the staging of any matches or organized team activities will be dependent upon the guidelines of the state and county jurisdictions in which teams are based.\n\nMinor League Cricket will continue to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis and consider any necessary delays in the best interests of the league and all stakeholders including owners, players, and other key partners. There will be a further update in 3 to 4 weeks’ time with the official plans for the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket.\n\nSameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan of American Cricket Enterprises commented, “Our main aim with Minor League Cricket is to give a platform and opportunity for the best cricketers in America to showcase their abilities. We would like to call on cricketers across all 50 states to register now to have a chance of playing in Minor League Cricket via the first-ever nationwide draft for cricketers in the USA.\n\n“We will only proceed with plans to run the inaugural edition of Minor League Cricket when absolutely safe to do so. We continue to assess all scenarios and have worked on possible mitigating practices to give the league the best chance of proceeding in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a rapidly evolving situation, so for now we will defer any decisions until the next formal announcement towards the end of July.”\n\n“USA Cricket would like to thank our partners at American Cricket Enterprises for their efforts in establishing Minor League Cricket during what has been a very difficult time for the country,” said USA Cricket Chief Executive Iain Higgins. “A huge amount of work has been done and we have been in daily contact with the team at ACE throughout, including how to best work through the various complications that the COVID-19 crisis has presented. We are in complete agreement it is best to only begin any cricket when absolutely safe for everyone in the American cricket community. However, the announcement of the Player Registration process is a positive and exciting step and we encourage all interested cricketers to register with Minor League Cricket as soon as possible.\n\n“In light of the continuing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic in this country, USA Cricket continues to defer making any final decisions in respect to rescheduling the Men’s 50-Over National Championships in 2020 and the domestic playing calendar for men, women and youth generally. We are hopeful that we will be able to reschedule some of our planned activities for 2020 and will announce those plans as soon as we can be definitive about them. In the meantime, our scenario planning continues to be integrated with ACE and Minor League Cricket in order to provide the best and well-coordinated playing opportunities for our domestic talent.”",

        "body": "Major League Cricket announced today the bookend dates for the 2022 rendition of the Minor League Cricket Championship.\n\nThe second season of the only coast-to-coast nationally supported T20 franchise cricket league in the USA is set to start on the June 25th weekend and run through August, with Finals Weekend set for August 26-27.\n\n“Following the most extensive tournament in American cricket history taking place successfully in 2021, we can’t wait to bring back an even stronger Minor League Cricket Championship in 2022,” Justin Geale, Minor League Cricket’s Tournament Director was quoted in the announcement. “The commitment shown by our Minor League Cricket teams to growing the game in their communities and developing players will see the sport take further significant strides this year, with MiLC providing a critical pathway to the USA National Team.”\n\nEvidence of that pathway is already apparent after MiLC’s first season, as many top performers earned debuts into the national T20 setup, most notably Ryan Scott of the Michigan Cricket Stars and Vatsal Vaghela of the Golden State Grizzlies. Scott and Vaghela finished the 2021 MiLC season as the highest rated domestic batter and bowler, respectively, and made their USA debuts against Ireland in the recently concluded historic T20 series in Florida.\n\nAfter 27 teams competed in a regular season that spanned across four regional divisions, the 2021 MiLC season ended with the Silicon Valley Strikers defeating the New Jersey Stallions in front of a healthy crowd at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. USA Cricket fast bowler Jessy Singh captained the Stallions to the inaugural final, and fell short of the title, which for now belongs to fellow USA Cricket teammates Saurabh Netravalkar, Abhishek Paradkar, and Rahul Jariwala of the Unmukt Chand captained Silicon Valley Strikers.\n\n“Nobody had expectations besides us, looking at our squad. We had a young squad. We knew if we backed them up, these guys would fire good on a big stage,” Jessy Singh told Emerging Cricket. “Winning the championship was the goal, so that left a bitter taste. But leading the side was definitely a great experience for myself. It was a young bunch of guys, and bringing the best out of the players and leading the team to the finals was a big achievement for me and for the team, but credit goes to the entire team for backing each other up, and that just makes it easy for me as a captain.”\n\nThe Stallions were clearly fortunate that their decision to back youth paid off well in the short term, but with a full season of prime chances for young players like U19 opener Sai Mukkamalla and all rounder Ray Ramrattan behind them, the Stallions have no reason not to shoot for the stars in 2022.\n\n“The hope for this season is to finish the job we left unfinished last year, the expectation doesn’t go below that,” Singh continued. “The expectation is to come back and finish as champions of the whole Minor League. If given the opportunity to lead the team again, I would be honored and accept the challenge to lead the Stallions to the championship. Backing the young guys would be very important to me, because they’re the ones who got us there, and they deserve it.”\n\nSeveral announcements regarding the details of the 2022 season should follow shortly, including the retention rosters of the teams, “a variety of enhancement to broadcast plans,” the fleshed out 2022 MiLC schedule, and more. According to the announcement, the two conference/four division league structure will remain intact.",
        "summary": "The 2022 Minor League Cricket Championship is set to take place from June 25 to August, with Finals Weekend scheduled for August 26-27. This is the second season of the tournament, which is the only coast-to-coast nationally supported T20 franchise cricket league in the USA. The tournament aims to provide a pathway to the USA National Team, with several top performers from the 2021 season already earning debuts in the national T20 setup. The 2021 season saw 27 teams compete in a regular season across four regional divisions, with the Silicon Valley Strikers emerging as champions. The Stallions, who finished as runners-up, are looking to build on their success in the 2022 season, with captain Jessy Singh hoping to lead the team to the championship title. Further announcements regarding the 2022 season, including team rosters, broadcast plans, and the schedule, are expected soon."

        "body": "Minor League Cricket’s (MiLC) inaugural miniseason continues with six more games, as USA Cricket has announced a fifth exhibition weekend in Illinois, Texas and California.\n\nFour weekends have seen plenty of action and drama as many of the nation’s best cricketers team up and face off across the country. The shortened MiLC season has already featured 45 games, seven centuries, three five-wicket hauls, two positive instances of Covid-19, and a nonstriker runout.\n\nIn Texas, the Austin Athletics (2-3) play the Houston Hurricanes (2-3) in a home and away series. On Saturday, the Athletics host the Hurricanes on the artificial wicket of Round Rock Cricket Ground in Austin, Texas at 1pm. Sunday’s matchup is back on turf in Houston at the Prairie View Cricket Complex.\n\nThe Texas group has played on turf and artificial wickets, with quite different results. On turf, the group averages a first innings score of 131, and the chasing team has won 4 out of 5 times. On artificial surfaces, the group averages a first innings score of 182, and the team batting first has won 3 out of 4. This represents a first innings run rate difference of 2.55 an over between turf and artificial surfaces.\n\nAthletics batsman Ali Samad has performed well on the turf wickets at Prairie View, twice scoring half centuries to lead his team to victory against the Hurricanes and the Irving Mustangs. “I love to play on turf wicket, it’s real cricket, totally different cricket than astro,” Ali told Emerging Cricket.\n\nSamad’s 57 not out from 35 balls on September 19 was enough to boost Austin beyond Houston’s 169 in 18.3 overs. On October 3, Ali came in one down chasing 132 and batted 13 overs scoring 50 off of 51 before finally succumbing to Nosthush Kenjige. He did however set the stage for Willem Ludick to finish the job with 28 off of 12. Ali’s 4 overs for 13 runs and a wicket in the first innings also contributed significantly to the 6 wicket win.\n\nHouston has not been without their own turf performers. In that losing effort on September 19, former Pakistan international Rameez Raja Jr’s 103 not out from 64 helped Houston set a target of 169, the highest first innings total on turf in the Texas group by 37 runs. Across all surfaces, Rameez has 240 runs from five innings with a strike rate of 155.84 and an average of 60.\n\nIn the West, East Bay Blazers take on Silicon Valley Strikers in a Saturday doubleheader at Arroyo Park. The Bay Area group is the only group in the league to feature every game on turf. When compared the Texas group on turf, the Bay Area’s average first innings is six runs higher than the former’s, at 137.3 runs. “It’s been really good to play all our games on turf, it brings about an even contest between bat and ball. Batsmen are rewarded for applying themselves, and there’s something for the bowlers too,” Blazer’s Josh Dascombe told Emerging Cricket. “Hopefully we can see more games on turf moving forward right across the country, providing an even yardstick.”\n\nThe Blazers pace attack has arguably been their biggest asset. Nick Mclachlan (23.4 overs, 4.37 econ, 10 wickets), USA national player Rusty Theron (24 overs, 5.21 econ, 10 wickets) and 21 year old Ruchir Joshi (22 overs, 5.86 econ, 5 wickets) have led an attack which has put the Blazers on top of the table with five wins out of six. Left arm orthodox Josh Dascombe (18.2 overs, 6.44 econ, 7 wickets) has been reliable and dangerous as the primary spinner for the Blazers.\n\n“The most pleasing part from a team perspective is how equal the contributions have been throughout the year,” said Dascombe. “We haven’t had to rely on one or two, everyone has contributed with the bat, putting their hand up and performing from time to time, and with the ball too.” Indeed, the youth have thrived along with the more experienced veterans. Seventeen year olds Dev Thanadi (10 overs, 5.5 econ, 5 wickets) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (11 overs, 6.18 econ, 4 wickets) have both performed when given the ball. Krishnamurthi has also done the job as a finisher with the bat, ranking second on the team in runs to former USA batsman Shiva Vashishat with 140.\n\nFinally, the MidWest group will feature a weekend home and home series between the Chicago Catchers and the Chicago Blasters, with Saturday’s contest at Washingon Park, and Sunday’s at Prairie Lakes Park. The Blasters pace the table at 2-0, with both wins coming against the Michican Cricket Stars. The Catchers at 1-1 would claim sole possession of first place with a series sweep.\n\nIn the Blasters most recent game, Shaheer Hasan and Fahad Babar joined up to set an MiLC exhibition opening partnership record of 174, carrying the team all the way to a 10 wicket win against Michigan. In the first innings, slow left arm orthodox bowler Hunain Amin stifled the Cricket Stars batting, allowing 19 runs off of 4 overs with 3 wickets. For the Cricket Stars, Arjun Ajbani (41 from 32) and Shaker Ahmed (38 from 27) clicked in the middle order to help set a target of 169.\n\nThe Catchers most recent game was also a win against Michigan Cricket Stars. Aamir Shahzad (4-17-2), Waseem Khan (4-21-2), and Sikander Soleja (3.4-20-3) combined to cut Captain Shaker Ahmed (25 from 16) and the Stars innings short in the 19th over, all out for 132. In the second innings, Sarwar Ghori (32 from 26) and Arjun Arun Kumar (65 from 51) helped the Catchers batting take off, and the momentum carried the Catchers to a 7 wicket victory in the 18th over.\n\nThe remainder of the exhibition season schedule will be announced by USA Cricket next week.",

        "body": "by Smit Patel • Last updated on\n\nSilicon Valley Strikers have parted ways with captain Unmukt Chand. © Getty\n\nAfter the box office success of Major League Cricket (MLC), American Cricket Enterprises (owners of MLC) are keen to ride the momentum onto its pathway league Minor League Cricket (MiLC), launching this weekend. The 26 team franchise affair is touted to be a semi professional league underpinning the MLC, a developmental league on the lines of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. The tournament, spanning over 2 months, will see over 150 T20 games being played over 15 states in the US.\n\nThere have been major overhauls in the makeup of the squads that took the field last year. Defending champions, Seattle Thunderbolts have been severely impacted by the spate of departures as captain Harmeet Singh, Andries Gous, Shubham Ranjane and Phani Simhadri move down to the Central and Southern Conference teams.\n\nIn a surprise move, Silicon Valley Strikers parted ways with captain Unmukt Chand who's been the most prolific batter of the league over two seasons apart from having the Strikers lift the silverware in the inaugural season. Former Pakistan and MI New York allrounder, Hammad Azam will now be at Dallas Mustangs. Azam was named the MVP of the inaugural season before an injury laden second season mostly saw him out of action for Golden State Grizzlies. A slew of PSL cricketers will call quits to Pakistan cricket after qualifying as local cricketers in the MiLC including the likes of former Pakistan U19 captain Hassan Khan, Imran Khan Jnr. and Zia ul Haq.\n\nThe league will also see USA national players in action as they strive to remain relevant in the wake of cricketers like Corey Anderson, Harmeet Singh, Smit Patel and Shadley Van Schalkwyk qualifying for the national team after serving their cool off period. Skipper Monank Patel will make his way across the Hudson to play for the New Jersey Stallion after appearing for the Empire State Titans last year. Steven Taylor is set to miss the season owing to his CPL commitments with the Jamaica Tallawahs.\n\n\"The recent success of Major League Cricket shows the strong appetite for cricket in America and the long-term plan to build American cricket is dependent on a successful pipeline of talent coming through Minor League Cricket,\" said Zubin Surkari, Tournament Director, Minor League Cricket. \"The third season of MiLC will allow fans to see many players who featured in MLC up close while giving the next generation of American cricket stars the chance to shine.\"\n\nThe 26 teams are divided into Atlantic and Pacific Conferences. The Atlantic conference is further segregated into eastern and southern divisions while the Pacific conference is further bifurcated into western and central divisions. The league stage and playoff rounds will culminate in a finals week at the Grand Prairie Stadium, the site of the MLC final, on October 6-7.\n\n© Cricbuzz"

        "date": "",
        "body": "by Smit Patel • Last updated on\n\nRepresentative Image: The 24-team city-based T20 competition is slated to begin on August 22 © Getty\n\nUSA Cricket and American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) announced the opening of an online player registration portal for the inaugural edition of the 24-team city-based Minor League Cricket T20. The registration process which opened up earlier this week is set to continue until its deadline on July 31. The registration process will lay the initial groundwork for the player draft which is tentatively set for the first week of August.\n\n\"It is exciting to know that we have received over 1000 player registrations on our website at majorleaguecricket.com in mere two days of the opening of the registration process. Minor League Cricket is confirmed for this year starting August 22 obviously keeping Covid (impacts) in mind. It is thrilling to introduce an official top level domestic T20 cricket tournament in the US that will feature players of international repute and quality,\" said William Swann, Director of Corporate Development at ACE to Cricbuzz.\n\nCricbuzz understands that there are multiple moving pieces to the player draft of the first edition of the Minor League. All the four conferences (Western, Central, Southern and Eastern) will further constitute to have its own 'draft zones' if there is more than one team situated in the vicinity, the idea being to hold a draft in each draft zone rather than having a single unified draft on the whole. For example, the Eastern Conference consists of a draft zone that encompasses New Jersey and New York City. This draft zone is set to field 3 teams and these 3 teams will then partake in a draft that will consist of players registered specifically in these draft zones.\n\nLeading up to the draft day a franchise owner will be able to recruit 3 'professional players', 3 'domestic players' and 3 U21 players in their 18 men roster. A franchise owner can directly recruit these players outside of the draft provided the player had selected that franchise owner's team as the 'preferred team' during the registration process.\n\nA player who has played any game at the international, FC, List A or 'T20' level will be considered a 'professional'. The professional players are further classified into 'domestic professionals', who are players domiciled in the US and 'Wildcard professionals' who are players not domiciled in the US. However, there will be a cap of only 1 wildcard professional per team. Players will be considered in the domestic and U21 categories if they are US citizens or are already domiciled in the US and do not fall in the 'professional' category.\n\nDespite ACE being the promoters and owners of the Minor League, USA Cricket CEO Iain Higgins in an earlier chat with Cricbuzz had indicated that Minor League Cricket will be one of the important pathways towards national selection and the board intends to work closely with ACE on matters governing selection policies among a few others.\n\n\"We want to be as transparent with the governance and selection matters as possible. We have set up a Minor League Governing Council that will be comprised of members from ACE, USA Cricket office bearers and a few representatives from the independent local leagues\" said Sameer Mehta of ACE.\n\n\"We have also put selection mechanisms in place. Each team will have a 3-member selection committee to oversee squad selection. The chairman of the selection committee will be appointed by the franchise owner with strong ties in the local cricketing fraternity. The other 2 selectors will be appointed by ACE in consultation with the Governing Council and the franchise owner respectively.\"\n\nUS is a home to an incredibly large number of expats from the commonwealth and the Indian subcontinent especially. This includes innumerable players who have played decent amount of representational and age limit competitive cricket in their homeland as well as the 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants who have successfully managed to preserve the game in a country where cricket is by large an alien sport. With more than 400 players set to be drafted into these teams to play official domestic cricket for the very first time in their lives, Minor League Cricket is set to galvanize the US cricketing community like never before.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet"

        "body": "Eleven versus Eleven. Bowler versus batter. Each person doing all that they can for their team – but also engaged in a personal pursuit of optimal performance, knowing cricket’s unforgiving individual spotlight and statistics leave nowhere to hide.\n\nFew cricketers can win a game on their own, even if a Viv Richards or a Ben Stokes have sometimes made that seem possible. But it’s also certainly true that top individual performers drive team success. Halfway through the Toyota Minor League Cricket Championship season, who are the performers to watch out for contributing the most to their teams in the critical countdown to the playoffs?\n\nOn the bowling side, here’s your top 10 wicket-takers for the season so far across the entire league of 27 teams:\n\nT20 might feel like a batter’s game at times, without the time for bowlers to pin the game down and dry runs up, but key wickets – and a good economy rate – turn matches around. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that eight out of this top 10 list play for teams in the top two of their respective division standings, the cut-off mark to qualify for the playoffs (Najam Iqbal of the Blasters, fifth in the Central Division, and Manoj Acharya of the Manhattan Yorkers, third in the Eastern Division, are the exceptions).\n\nTop of the standings, Vatsal Vaghela has been exceptional for the Golden State Grizzlies, who have lost only one of six games. The former USA U-19 All-rounder has yet to feature with the bat, but he’s made up for that with the ball, claiming more than three wickets in no fewer than five of those six matches. Facing the Surf Riders and Master Blasters this weekend, two of the bottom three teams in the Western Division, Vaghela will look to add to those numbers and firm up the Grizzlies’ tight playoff chase with the Blazers and the Strikers.\n\nIn the high-scoring Eastern Division, it’s been less friendly territory for bowlers, but that hasn’t stopped Jessy Singh claiming 15 wickets at a smart economy rate of 5.14 for the New Jersey Stallions. The US National Team player, 28, will need to be at his best this weekend to keep the Stallions top of the Eastern Division as they face two of the chasing pack who can pile on the runs: the Philadelphians on Saturday and the Cavaliers on Sunday. Hear Jessy talk to the Minor League Cricket Show about his season so far:\n\nWho has been smoking the ball best across the league? Let’s take a look.\n\nSouth Africans Obus Pienaar, for the St Louis Americans, and Andries Gous, of the Seattle Thunderbolts, have impressed in piling on the highest volume of runs so far. But in T20 cricket, of course, it’s strike-rate that matters almost as much in contributing to team victories.\n\nAnd boy does one number stand out in that top ten: the Michigan Cricket Stars’ Ryan Scott’s outrageous strike-rate of 201.79, helped enormously of course by his brilliant 118* from only 48 balls against the Houston Hurricanes. That result started a critical streak of three consecutive wins for the Stars, taking them to second in the standings. Michigan will need Scott at his blistering best this weekend, facing the two teams immediately below in the standings: the Austin Athletics on Saturday, and the Irving Mustangs on Sunday.\n\nIn the Southern Division, runs have been harder to come by – particularly at the home of the Morrisville Cardinals, Church Street Park. That makes the numbers Jaskaran Malhotra has compiled even more impressive: though he didn’t quite make the top ten above, with 214 runs at a strike-rate of 171.20, the newly recalled American international has helped Morrisville to first place in the standings. The Cardinals will need Malhotra at his best this weekend, with a pair of crucial matches on Saturday and Sunday against the third-placed Orlando Galaxy.\n\nNotably, Malhotra has also chipped in with four wickets as well as captaining the team. In a sport all about the balance of bat, ball, team and individual, Malhotra is certainly amongst the leading MVP candidates across the league as we head to the sharp end of the season.",
        "summary": "**Bowling Performances:**\n\n* Top 10 wicket-takers in the league so far:\n\t+ Vatsal Vaghela (Golden State Grizzlies) leads the standings with impressive performances, taking more than three wickets in five out of six matches.\n\t+ Jessy Singh (New Jersey Stallions) has claimed 15 wickets at an economy rate of 5.14 in the high-scoring Eastern Division.\n\n**Batting Performances:**\n\n* Obus Pienaar (St Louis Americans) and Andries Gous (Seattle Thunderbolts) have scored the highest volume of runs so far.\n* Ryan Scott (Michigan Cricket Stars) has an impressive strike-rate of 201.79, thanks to his 118* from 48 balls against the Houston Hurricanes.\n* Jaskaran Malhotra (Morrisville Cardinals) has compiled 214 runs at a strike-rate of 171.20, helping his team to first place in the Southern Division standings.\n\n**Notable Mentions:**\n\n* Jaskaran Malhotra is also an MVP candidate, having chipped in with four wickets and captaining the Morrisville Cardinals.\n* Eight out of the top 10 bowlers play for teams in the top two of their respective division standings, which is the cut-off mark to qualify for the playoffs."

        "body": "It is learnt that USA Cricket has approved MLC as well as Minor League Cricket, meaning both events can go ahead as planned\n\nESPNcricinfo staff\n\n14-Apr-2023\n\nThe ICC has given official sanction to Major League Cricket (MLC), the USA's big leap into the world of T20 leagues, removing a significant obstacle to the league launching in July this year. A long-simmering dispute between the league's organisers and USA Cricket, the country's official cricket administrative body, had threatened to disrupt the league starting this year.\n\nHowever, USA Cricket announced on Thursday night in a brief statement that it has approved MLC as well as Minor League Cricket (MiLC), meaning that both events can go ahead as planned. Crucially, it means that ICC members are now free to issue NOCs (No Objection Certificates) to any of their players picked by MLC sides to participate in the league.\n\n\"Over the past few months, we have worked diligently with Ace [American Cricket Enterprises, the parent body of MLC and MILC] to ensure that the MLC and MiLC are positioned well to support the growth of cricket in the United States,\" said USA Cricket in a press release.\n\nUSA Cricket had previously given sanction to MiLC, for both the 2021 and 2022 seasons, but soon after the MLC's player draft, the ICC's operations department sent a communication to members flagging the issue for overseas players wishing to play in both competitions. \"Members may be aware of the following two events that are proposed to be played in the USA,\" the ICC had said of the events, both administered by ACE, which signed a 50-year commercial rights agreement with USA Cricket in 2019.\n\nRelated\n\nMI New York unveil Rashid, Boult and Rabada in star-studded MLC squad\n\nMLC start under threat after dispute between organisers and USA Cricket\n\nOwners of Mumbai Indians, CSK, Delhi Capitals to own teams in MLC\n\n\"Applications for sanction have been submitted to USA Cricket, but these events have not yet been sanctioned by USA Cricket. Consequently, without a sanction from the host member, both events are currently deemed to be Disapproved Cricket and as such, Members should not issue NOCs to their players to participate in either event.\"\n\nThe draft, held on March 19 at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, saw stars such as Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis and Quinton de Kock sign for teams in the league. In total six teams will play in the 18-day event in Texas that starts from July 13 - as with several other leagues, some of the franchises are owned by owners of IPL franchises.\n\n\"Last month's historic MLC Domestic Player Draft in Houston generated incredible momentum for the inaugural Major League Cricket season this summer,\" MLC tournament director Justin Geale told ESPNcricinfo following the confirmation that USA Cricket had given sanctioning approval to MLC. \"Our six MLC teams will each be announcing a number of marquee international player signings in the coming weeks that will generate more excitement, and we will be sharing news on the schedule, ticket sales and broadcast details soon.\n\n\"We're now just three months away from many of the world's best players taking the field in Texas at an outstanding new cricket venue in Grand Prairie. We can't wait to bring the American cricket community together there and launch this ground breaking competition.\"\n\nThe dispute between USA Cricket and ACE which caused the delay in sanctioning MLC and MiLC stems from the original short-form agreement the two signed in 2019. In that agreement, ACE keeps 95% of all gross revenues generated by MLC while USA Cricket receives the remaining 5%, but USA Cricket has wanted to revise that for more favourable terms, before a long-form agreement is signed. USA Cricket reiterated that sentiment in Thursday's press release.\n\n\"We look forward to working with Ace to provide governance of the tournaments,\" stated USA Cricket in the press release. \"Finally, we will review our commercial relationship with Ace over the next few months.\"",
        "summary": "* USA Cricket has approved Minor League Cricket (MiLC) and Major League Cricket (MLC), allowing both events to proceed as planned.\n* The approval means that ICC members can now issue NOCs (No Objection Certificates) to players participating in MLC.\n* MiLC has previously received sanction from USA Cricket for the 2021 and 2022 seasons.\n* The MLC tournament is scheduled to start on July 13 in Texas and will feature six teams playing in an 18-day event.\n* The tournament has already seen stars such as Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, and Quinton de Kock sign for teams in the league.\n* The approval comes after a dispute between USA Cricket and ACE, the parent body of MLC and MiLC, was resolved. USA Cricket had previously wanted to revise the revenue-sharing agreement with ACE before giving sanctioning approval."

        "body": "The Seattle Thunderbolts continued a streak of remarkable form into the final of the 2022 Toyota Minor League Cricket Championship presented by Sunoco, defeating the Atlanta Fire by 10 runs to claim the 2022 championship title on Sunday, Aug. 28. The Thunderbolts claimed a $150,000 purse for winning America’s most extensive cricket championship, with their star bowler Phani Simhadri awarded the 2022 Most Valuable Player award for the season.\n\nThe match, held in scenic Church Street Park in Morrisville, NC, reached an exciting conclusion under the lights with thousands of fans in attendance. The Seattle team won the toss and elected to bat, with opener Andries Gous hitting a quick-fire 48 from 44 balls and Shubham Ranjane scoring a half-century, reaching 51 off 45 deliveries. An unbeaten flurry of 27 from only 14 balls by Shadley Van Schalkwyk helped Seattle to post a total of 157 runs. Atlanta’s bowling was led by Steven Taylor, taking three wickets in his four overs.\n\nAtlanta’s run chase faltered as conditions cooled into the evening. Fire captain Aaron Jones anchored the innings with 64 from 51 balls but could only watch on as wickets fell around him, no other Atlanta batter passing 30 runs. Shubham Ranjane was the pick of the Seattle bowlers, claiming four wickets to go along with his half-century to resoundingly earn Player of the Match honors.\n\nThe Fire’s last gasp efforts to win were extinguished when Phani Simhadri took two wickets in the nineteenth over. The league MVP took three wickets on the day, giving Simhadri a remarkable total of 46 wickets throughout the tournament at a strike rate of 8.8 and an economy rate of 6.13.\n\nThe last over began with the Fire needing an unlikely 18 runs to win with only two wickets remaining. Seattle claimed the title with Atlanta falling 10 runs short of their target. The Thunderbolts’ incredible run of form has seen the Seattle team win eight straight completed games, culminating with captain Harmeet Singh lifting the MiLC trophy as the 2022 Toyota Minor League Cricket champions.",

        "date": "Wed Aug 17 00:00:00 2022",
        "body": "With the regular season coming to an end this past weekend, it’s a great chance to take a moment to appreciate the top performers of the MiLC season before we turn our attention to the playoffs. In this post, Tom Nielsen covers the top performers of the 2022 Minor League Cricket season, using our Total Impact stats. We’ll look at the top individual Batters, Bowlers, and All-Rounders of the season. For a refresher on the impact stats, check out this post from earlier in the season.\n\nTop Batters\n\nFirst up, we’ll look at the top 20 batters of Minor League Cricket on a Total Impact basis. The table shows the actual runs and wickets for each batter, compared to expected runs and wickets for the average batter in the same match situations, in addition to strike rate, total impact, and impact per innings (which adjusts for players missing matches due to rain outs or other commitments). The impact figures account for ground impacts, so players who play at especially batter-or-bowler-friendly grounds will not be unfairly rewarded or punished.\n\nWe’ll take a deep dive into the top five and call out some other notes:\n\nRahkeem Cornwall, Atlanta Fire: One of the highest-profile signings of the season, Cornwall came through in spades, smashing 531 runs at an astonishing 193 strike rate. For comparison, the highest strike rate from a 500+ run batter in 2021 was just 152. Rahkeem opened the batting for the Fire every match and usually didn’t take any time getting started, reaching 20 runs by his tenth ball faced on six separate occasions this year. He started and ended the season in classic Rahkeem style, with a 93 (41) on opening weekend and 86 (50) on the final weekend, two of his four 50s on the season.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya, Silicon Valley Strikers: Sitting just two runs behind Cornwall on Total Impact from the same number of matches played but with a much different statistical profile is Shehan Jayasuriya. Jayasuriya led Minor League Cricket with 647 runs scored, on a lower (but still excellent!) strike rate of 152. Jayasuriya was Silicon Valley’s #3 batter all year, and had an incredible stretch early in the season including back to back unbeaten centuries on July 4th weekend: 112* (60) and 115* (65), which were followed up by a 63 and 86 the next weekend.\n\nDavid White, East Bay Blazers: With Jayasuriya, David White was the only batter in Minor League Cricket to surpass 600 runs, with the next highest at just 532 on the season. David White was extremely reliable all year while opening the batting, scoring at least 35 runs in 10 of his 14 matches, and being out for under 10 just twice: doing an outstanding job building a platform for the Blazers. As part of a league-wide trend towards faster scoring, White bumped his strike rate up to 146 this season from just 115 in 2021, setting the tone in a season-opening 35 (15) flurry in a narrow win against the Seattle Thunderbolts.\n\nLahiru Milantha, Morrisville Raptors: Potentially a candidate for most improved player in Minor League Cricket, Lahiru Milantha put up 511 runs at a 149 strike rate, compared to just 157 and 118 in 2021 (from 5 fewer matches). Lahiru topped 40 runs in eight of his 12 matches, the highlight being a season-defining performance against the Atlanta Fire on the penultimate weekend, when he went 91 off 47 to lead Morrisville to 203 runs, which they defended to set up playoff-clinching opportunities in the last weekend.\n\nKatene Clarke, SoCal Lashings: The New Zealander broke onto the Minor League Cricket scene in a big way in 2022, Clarke put up 532 runs at a strike rate of 143 opening the batting for the SoCal Lashings. Katene Clarke was unafraid of big competition from Northern California this year, putting up 99 (70) against Golden State, 60 (46) against Silicon Valley, and 117* (70) against the East Bay.\n\nHonorable Mentions: A couple batters snuck into the top 20 despite not playing a full schedule. First, Shamar Springer of the Atlanta Lightning, who played in the Lightning’s first five matches, putting up 202 runs highlighted by 71* (31) and 65* (25) in winning efforts. John Campbell bashed 253 runs at over two runs per ball for the Manhattan Yorkers through July, highlighted by 85* (32) against the Somerset Cavaliers on July 9th, the most runs scored at 32 balls in Minor League Cricket this season.\n\nThe chart below shows run scoring rates and wicket loss rates for each batter that faced at least 150 balls in Minor League Cricket relative to the average batter in the same match situations. Batters with elite run scoring rates will show up further right, and batters that do a great job keeping their wicket will show up lower. This is an excellent demonstration of the different “flavors” of Minor League Cricket’s top batters: we have the out-and-out bashers to the right-Rahkeem Cornwall, Roy Silva, Ryan Scott, Chandrapaul Hemraj, and further down and to the left the more consistent high scorers in Unmukt Chand, David White, and Shehan Jayasuriya. It’s also a good demonstration of what all cricket fans instinctively know: the natural give and take that comes with scoring fast, where you’re certain to lose your wicket more often with aggressive play.\n\nTop Bowlers\n\nNext, we’ll look at the top 20 bowlers of Minor League Cricket this season on a Total Impact basis. The table shows the actual runs allowed and wickets for each bowler, compared to expected runs and wickets for the average bowler in the same match situations, in addition to economy, total impact, and impact per over (which adjusts for players missing time due to rain outs or other commitments or being used sparingly). The impact figures account for ground impacts, so players who play at especially batter-or-bowler-friendly grounds will not be unfairly rewarded or punished.\n\nWe’ll take a deep dive into the Top 5 and call out some other notes:\n\nHarmeet Singh, Seattle Thunderbolts: The most-used bowler in Minor League Cricket was also the most valuable bowler in Minor League Cricket. Harmeet Singh bowled 54 overs out of a maximum possible 56 overs across 14 matches: and for good reason as batters scored 27% more slowly against Harmeet than the average bowler. Harmeet did most of his damage in the middle overs, taking 12 wickets at a tight 4.87 economy across 30 overs in the phase. His effectiveness was exemplified on the final day of the season, as he took two wickets for just 15 runs across his four overs, helping to throttle Golden State to just 110 runs, which Seattle was able to chase down in just 7.1 overs to make the playoffs.\n\nNosthush Kenjige, Dallas Mustangs: Despite missing the final two weekends of the season on (extremely well-deserved) US National Team duty, Nosh Kenjige slots into second in total impact for bowlers on the season. On a per-over basis, Nosh had the best impact (min. 30 overs) in Minor League Cricket, restricting opponents’ totals by -3.80 per over. Much of his damage was due to incredible wicket-taking ability, taking 23 wickets on the season (seven of his 11 matches being multi-wicket performances), good for a wicket every 10 balls. Nosh was effective in every phase of the game, bowling at least nine overs each in the powerplay, middle overs, and the death while posting a sub -3 impact per over in each.\n\nPhani Simhadri, Seattle Thunderbolts: Making up the second half of the only pair of teammates on either top five list is Phani Simhadri, the leading wicket taker of the 2022 season with 33 wickets across 53 overs. Simhadri was the definition of a death bowling specialist this season, with over half his overs coming in this phase as he took an astonishing 26 wickets from 29 overs in the final six overs of the match. He took multiple wickets in every match but two this year. Where Harmeet starred with the ball in the final match of the season, Simhadri made a huge contribution in the equally-important penultimate match against the Grizzlies, taking three wickets for just eight runs across his 3.0 overs to bowl out Golden State early and facilitate a quick chase to boost the NRR.\n\nCalvin Savage, Chicago Tigers: New to Minor League Cricket and playing for a new franchise, Calvin Savage made a huge splash in his debut season. Savage had an outstanding economy rate at 4.75, an all-time Minor League Cricket best for any bowler who bowled at least 30 overs. His tight bowling equated to allowing 34% fewer runs than the average bowler in the same situations. As captain of the Tigers, Savage used himself with remarkable consistency, opening the bowling with exactly a 2-over spell in every match, and generally coming back in the death overs to complete his quota. Calvin’s season was perhaps highlighted by an absurd 3-game stretch early on, where he took six wickets and allowed just 32 runs from 12 overs, including figures of 4/9 against the St. Louis Americans.\n\nSarbjeet Singh Ladda, DC Hawks: is now the career leader in wickets in Minor League Cricket, taking 27 from 52.2 overs in 2022 to go with an even better 29-wicket haul in 2021. Though his wicket-taking ability was similar, Ladda has significantly improved his economy this year, dropping it to 6.10 from 7.09 last year, helping him shoot up the bowling impact leaderboard. Sarbjeet took a 4-wicket haul thrice this year, the only bowler to do so more than once alongside Manoj Acharya, who did so twice. The highlight this year was taking four wickets while allowing just fiveruns from 4.0 overs against the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers, where he took a wicket from each of his overs.\n\nThe chart below shows wicket taking rates and run restriction rates for each bowler that bowled at least 30 overs in Minor League Cricket relative to the average bowler in the same match situations. Bowlers with elite economy rates will show up further left, and bowlers with elite wicket taking rates will show up higher. Nosh Kenjige had easily the best bowling impact per over out of qualifying bowlers, and this chart shows how much of an outlier he was, taking wickets at a significantly higher rate than all other bowlers while still restricting runs at an outstanding rate.\n\nOverall Impact Leaders\n\nLastly, let’s look at Total Impact statistics, combining both batting and bowling. As a reminder, positive batting impacts and negative bowling impacts are good: Total Impact is calculated by subtracting bowling impact from batting impact.\n\nThe top five are a step ahead of the pack, and all are names we saw from the top of the batting and bowling lists. We have the batting all-rounder Rahkeem Cornwall, bowling-focused all-rounders Harmeet Singh and Nosh Kenjige, pure batter Shehan Jayasuriya, and a pure all-rounder in Calvin Savage.",
        "summary": "**Top Batters:**\n\n1. Rahkeem Cornwall (Atlanta Fire) - 531 runs at a strike rate of 193\n2. Shehan Jayasuriya (Silicon Valley Strikers) - 647 runs at a strike rate of 152\n3.

        "title": "The Road to Minor League Cricket – Part Seven – Minor League Cricket News",
        "date": "Mon Mar  7 00:00:00 2022",
        "body": "While most pro athletes in this country have followed a relatively linear and predictable path in order to make it to the top of their game, there’s no template, blueprint, or well-traveled path for professional cricketers in the US. To make it to Minor League Cricket, players have had to navigate some pretty interesting routes (catch-up on parts four, five and six for more stories). Steve Steinberg from CricAmerica talked with two players who were born in the US, but spent a lot of their youth in India before returning to the States to discover their cricketing fame.\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi, East Bay Blazers\n\n“I started playing tennis ball cricket with my dad at the age of five in baseball fields in Arizona. And when I was seven, we watched the world cup in which India won. I remember waking up at one in the morning to watch the finals. And that was when I got really excited about cricket. Soon after that, our family moved to India, so I was able to start playing leather ball cricket over there.”\n\n“I joined a cricket academy pretty soon after I moved to India and at the age of 10, I moved to a school that was known for its cricket.” And despite coming from a far less cricket-crazed country, Sanjay found success early. He was selected into legendary Indian spinner Anil Kumble’s Spin Stars — a contest that featured the best young spin bowlers in his home state of Karnataka.\n\nNot wanting to be known simply as a bowler, Sanjay set his sights on becoming a more well-rounded cricketer. “At 15, I decided to focus more on my batting. The way the system works there is that you get to choose whether you want to try to get selected as a batsman or a bowler. They don’t give opportunities for an all-rounder to do both in the selection. So, I decided to focus that year on batting and I had the highest run score in the school tournament and then managed to make the state team. I played for Karnataka that year — Under-16 — as a batsman.”\n\nEven though he was drawing attention to his playing in India, Sanjay still kept an eye on what was going on back in the US. “USA Cricket first came to my attention when one of the guys that I knew from Arizona, Raj Vyas, took seven wickets in the Under-19 qualifiers. That news made it all the way to me in India. And that’s when I started looking into USA Cricket, because I’m an American citizen. Once I got interested in USA cricket, my first idea was to try to be part of the next USA Under-19 squad that could potentially make the World Cup.”\n\nAnd just as USA Cricket was now on Sanjay’s Radar, Sanjay was also on the radar of cricket higher-ups here in the US. After being asked to work out with the USA national team who were in Mumbai for a training camp before their tour of Nepal, Sanjay was invited to a training camp in Houston. And that’s when life bowled him and his family a googly. “So, two years ago, we came to Houston for a camp hosted by USA cricket. We were also going to visit my grandparents for a couple of weeks. And then Covid happened, and we weren’t able to go back. After about three months, my dad started looking for jobs here and got one in the Bay Area. Our whole family relocated, and I decided to start playing cricket here in San Francisco.”\n\nThat led to him being signed by the East Bay Blazers for the most recent Minor League Cricket season. Sanjay proved himself to be a true all-rounder by finishing in the Top 10 in both batting average and bowling economy for the Pacific Conference. And a call-up to the men’s national team wasn’t far behind. “I had just come back the previous night from one of the minor league games in St. Louis and was a bit jetlagged. When I woke up, I checked my phone and there were WhatsApp messages saying that you’ve been selected for the team you’ll need to get on a flight. And then it was kind of frantic rush to get Covid tests and packing done. I was in the airport about three or four hours later.”\n\nHaving been around top-tier cricket in both the US and India has given Sanjay some perspective: “I think minor league is just going to continue to grow. And the launch of Major League Cricket should be huge. And once both of them are working and minor league is feeding players into the major league, I think that’s gonna bring some really solid structure. I think that the talent in America is quite good at the top level. But in India, you might have a thousand players as talented as maybe the top 30 or 40 here, so the talent is here, but the depth of talent isn’t quite here. In India, the talent depth is amazing. But I think that the US is on a really good path and could possibly be a Top 10 or Top 12 country in the next few years.”\n\nWho would Sanjay want to play with on his Dream XI? “Jasprit Bumrah, because you need a solid death bowler and he brings wickets and can control economy at any time. Another bowler would probably be Rashid Khan for the same reason — he can take wickets at any time. In terms of batting, I would say AB de Villiers. He’s my favorite batsman to watch. And I think someone like Kieron Pollard would be able to scare the opposition.”\n\nJessy Singh, New Jersey Stallions\n\nWhile many of the country’s top cricketers developed their love for the game abroad, Jessy Singh’s story is unique. Born in the US, he moved to India where he lived for several years before returning to the New Jersey area as a teen. Ironically, it wasn’t in India where his love of cricket was born. “I was introduced to cricket in India, but never took any coaching or played any school cricket — just village cricket for fun a few times here and there. Actual cricket, for me, started here in New Jersey.”\n\n“I started playing cricket probably later than most kids. I think the first time I actually played hard ball cricket with a real cricket ball was when I was 16 or 17. I used to live in an apartment complex in New Jersey where there was a big Indian and Pakistani community. They would gather in the evening and start playing cricket right in front of the basketball court with a tennis ball. My dad’s friends in Princeton also used to play on Saturdays on Sundays right in their front yards with the stumps in the driveway. That’s when I started playing.”\n\n“I guess you could say I had a bit of natural talent. I would run in and just try to bowl fast. Some people who were playing in a league saw me and they started pushing me to play in a local league. It gives you a bit of motivation when people are talking about you and pushing you. And I started to like it. I sort of started becoming the talk of the area and that’s when I realized that I’m only 16 or 17 years old and there’s an Under-19 national team, so if I really pay attention and if I really give my 100 percent and work hard, I can make it. I wanted to play for USA and once I put that in my head, my goal was clear.”\n\n“There were trials being held for the Under-19 Atlantic region and I went with a club team. I was practicing on the side — I was bowling quick compared to some of the young guys — and I caught the eye of some of the Atlantic Region representatives and they wanted me to try out. I made the team and then was part of the Under-19 reserves for USA. I was expecting to make the Under-19 team for the World Cup qualifier, but somehow I didn’t make it. And I think that motivated me even more to work harder and make the senior team.” A few years later, in 2015, he achieved that goal and was named to the USA men’s national team.\n\nWhile the years he spent living in India as a kid weren’t instrumental to his cricketing career, a trip back to India was. In the HotStar docuseries “US6: The Homecoming” in 2018, he was one of six American cricketers chosen to visit India and experience its cricketing culture in-depth. “Being picked as one of the six guys out of I think 150 kids was a blessing in itself. It was such a huge set-up where you were rubbing shoulders with the IPL players and some of the greats and legends of the game like Sunil Gavaskar and Daren Sammy. Spending that one month among those cricketers on a daily basis tremendously helped my game. We were part of the Rajasthan Royals for two weeks and we were practicing with them, traveling with them, eating with them. That was definitely a different experience. That one month boosted my inner dedication and passion for the game even more.”\n\nFurther motivation and an added emphasis on fitness came as a result of a torn ACL and the rehab that went with it. “I was fit before that, but after the surgery I realized that my body is my biggest asset. If I don’t stay proactive with it then I can get injured and I could lose a lot of time. To spend that one year out of the game and literally two or three months in bed was definitely a turning point.”\n\nAll that rededication and focus paid off. In 2020, he was drafted by the Guyana Amazon Warriors of the Caribbean Premier League. “I got into the CPL and I didn’t even know it. This was during the Covid times when we were in lockdown and I was actually laying down on my couch and I just see a message from Ali Khan: “Congrats, bro. Finally!” And I’m like “What do you mean?” I had no idea whatsoever about it because the draft had happened very internally that year and I thought they might mainly stick to local players. When he told me I was picked by the Amazon Warriors, I was in shock. That’s one of your dreams to be part of the CPL.”\n\nJessy’s commute to his Minor League Cricket team this past season was a considerably shorter trip. Singh was dominant with the ball for the New Jersey Stallions, finishing in the Top 10 in the Atlantic Conference in both wickets and economy. The Stallions made it all the way to the MiLC finals before being stopped by the Silicon Valley Strikers.\n\nAnd he’s convinced Minor League Cricket can influence the game both locally and internationally: “I feel like the sky is the limit for this league. It’s not just big within the country. I feel like minor league has become the talk of cricket globally, as well. We get messages on social media so many times talking about minor league. A lot of people from outside of the country want to be part of it. And major league is going to start next year. That’s gonna be a great opportunity not just for us, but for every cricketer and every youth growing up in this country who’s looking to play cricket professionally.”\n\nWho would Jessy want to play with on his Dream XI? “I think first would be Dale Steyn. And you wouldn’t want to miss out on Rohit Sharma. I have quite a few names in mind, but I would want Imran Tahir to be a part of it as a spinner. And you can’t leave out Andre Russell — because Rovman Powell is already part of our (Stallions) team. So, Rovman is already there, so I’ll take Russell.",
        "summary": "The article features two American cricketers, Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Jessy Singh, who have unique paths to making it to Minor League Cricket. Sanjay was born in the US but spent his youth in India, where he developed his cricket skills and even played for Karnataka's Under-16 team. He later moved back to the US and joined the East Bay Blazers for the Minor League Cricket season, finishing in the Top 10 in both batting average and bowling economy for the Pacific Conference. He was subsequently called up to the men's national team.\n\nJessy Singh was also born in the US but lived in India for several years before returning to New Jersey as a teenager. He started playing cricket in New Jersey and was later drafted by the Guyana Amazon Warriors of the Caribbean Premier League. He played for the New Jersey Stallions in the Minor League Cricket season, finishing in the Top 10 in the Atlantic Conference in both wickets and economy.\n\nBoth players expressed their enthusiasm for the growth of cricket in the US, with Sanjay believing that the launch of Major League Cricket will bring structure and talent to the top level, and Jessy convinced that Minor League Cricket can influence the game both locally and internationally."

        "body": "With the overall Tournament Best XI already announced, Tom Nielsen now takes a look at the best team from the 2022 Minor League Cricket season currently available for selection by the USA.\n\nShayan Jahangir, Lone Star Athletics\n\nBatting: 507 Runs, 134 Strike Rate, 4 50s, +6.8 Impact per Match\n\nShayan Jahangir was a beacon of stability in a Lone Star Athletics lineup that struggled to produce runs this year. Jahangir’s 507 runs were good for second best in the Central Division, and he had unmatched consistency, scoring 45+ runs in seven of his 12 matches, including the first five of the year, while maintaining a respectable strike rate of 134. Jahangir’s lowest score on the season was 12, and he was the only player in Minor League Cricket history to appear in at least nine matches in a season and not go out for single digits.\n\nHanchard Hamilton, Atlanta Lightning (WK)\n\nBatting: 374 Runs, 126 Strike Rate, 5 50s, +3.6 Impact per Match\n\nHanchard Hamilton was a key cog in a deep Atlanta Lightning batting attack that had three 300+ run scorers on the season. After a slow start to the year, Hamilton tore it up in the last three weekends, with five consecutive half-centuries in high-pressure situations as the Lightning found themselves in a tough playoff fight. Across the five matches, Hamilton scored 309 runs at 139 strike rate, averaging 103, highlighted by 74* (45) in a losing effort against Morrisville on the penultimate day of the season.\n\nDominique Rikhi, New Jersey Stallions\n\nBatting: 502 Runs, 116 Strike Rate, 3 50s, +2.0 Impact per Match\n\nDominique Rikhi anchored the division champion New Jersey Stallions lineup from the opening position, his 502 runs the fourth most in the Atlantic Conference. Rikhi’s measured scoring approach served as a complement to Anthony Bramble, who scored at a much quicker 155 strike rate after being installed as Rikhi’s opening partner in the fourth week of the season. Rikhi also showed flashes of his ability to score quickly, compiling 43 (27) against the eventual Southern Division champion Atlanta Fire on the holiday weekend.\n\nAaron Jones, Atlanta Fire (C)\n\nBatting: 395 Runs, 151 Strike Rate, 3 50s, +12.5 Impact per Match\n\nDespite playing in just eight matches — including the playoffs — due to USA National Team obligations, Aaron Jones made a huge impact on the Atlanta Fire, finishing 7th in the Atlantic Conference in total runs. In six of his eight matches, Jones fired off 40+ runs, including a 64 (51) in the Finals, where the Fire came up just short of winning the title. Jones was massive in the playoffs, with a 72 (42) in the Conference Semi-Finals and 76* (46) in the Conference Finals to go along with his finals performance-212 runs in all at a 153 strike rate across just the three matches.\n\nPranay Suri, Silicon Valley Strikers\n\nBowling: 26 Wickets, 54.0 Overs, 6.37 Economy, -1.33 Impact per Over\n\nBatting: 259 Runs, 131 Strike Rate, +2.3 Impact per Match\n\nPranay Suri led the Strikers’ bowling attack in 2022, leading the team in wickets — his 26 taken good enough for third in all Minor League Cricket. Suri didn’t start the year as a regular in the bowling attack, bowling just five overs from Silicon Valley’s first three matches, but he took four wickets from those overs at an economy rate of 4.40 to cement his place for the rest of the season. Suri was one of just two players to take two 5-fors, taking 6/24 against Golden State and 5/10 against Seattle in consecutive matches in the middle of the season. He contributed with the bat as well, scoring 259 runs at a 131 strike rate from the middle order: good for the third most runs on the team.\n\nUsman Rafiq, Houston Hurricanes\n\nBowling: 23 Wickets, 47.5 Overs, 6.15 Economy, -2.01 Impact per Over\n\nBatting: 191 Runs, 153 Strike Rate, +4.8 Impact per Over\n\nUsman Rafiq was the other player to take two 5-fors on the season, also in back to back fashion: 5/24 vs Lone Star and 6/18 against the St. Louis Americans, which included four consecutive wickets to bowl them out in the final over. The right-arm spinner took 23 wickets on the season. Thirteen of those came from 13.5 death overs, where he also sported an outstanding 4.92 economy rate, equivalent to restricting his opponents’ scoring by -44% compared to the average bowler in the same situations. Rafiq was generally used as a finisher with the bat, scoring at an excellent 153 strike rate while coming in during the late overs. His top batting performance was a blitz of 48* (17) in a thrilling chase against the Lone Star Athletics. Rafiq came in with 5.4 overs left and the Hurricanes needing 62 runs and was able to finish off the chase with a four, a six, and three balls to spare.\n\nNosthush Kenjige, Dallas Mustangs\n\nBowling: 26 Wickets, 45.3 Overs, 4.95 Economy, -3.78 Impact per Over\n\nBatting: 139 Runs, 140 Strike Rate, 46.3 Average\n\nDespite missing time late in the season on US National Team duty, Nosh Kenjige turned in one of the best bowling performances in Minor League Cricket this year. Nosh led the Central Division with 26 wickets — a wicket every 10.5 balls — while sporting the best economy in the league amongst qualified bowlers at 4.95. Given the match situations he bowled in, Nosh restricted his opponents’ totals by an astounding 3.78 runs per over. That’s equivalent to 15 runs across a match when used for his full quota of overs. Nosh wasn’t too shabby with the bat either, following up impressive performances in last year’s National Championships with a solid 140 strike rate and 46.3 average while finishing not out in five of his eight matches. That was highlighted by 25* (11) against the Chicago Tigers and 40* (23) against Lone Star.\n\nSachin Mylavarapu, New Jersey Stallions\n\nBowling: 17 Wickets, 52.5 Overs, 5.39 Economy, -2.19 Impact per Over\n\nSachin Mylavarapu turned in another excellent Minor League Cricket season, lowering his economy from 5.52 in 2021 to 5.39 despite a league-wide increase in scoring, good for second best amongst qualifying bowlers in the Atlantic Conference this year. The highlight of the season for Mylavarapu was an absurd three wickets for four runs from 4.0 overs against the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers on the last day of the season. In that match, he took a wicket and gave up just one run in the first over and had a maiden in the third over to help restrict the Somerset Cavaliers to 63 runs in defense of 130.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar, Silicon Valley Strikers\n\nBowling: 18 Wickets, 37.2 Overs, 5.01 Economy, -3.04 Impact per Over\n\nLike his fellow US National Teamer Nosh Kenjige, Saurabh Netravalkar missed some time on USA duty but was incredible when available, putting up the fifth best aggregate bowling impact figures in the league despite missing eight of his team’s 18 matches. Netravalkar took a wicket in every match but one, highlighted by 5/17 (4.0) on opening day against Hollywood and 4/13 (3.1) in late July against Golden State. Netravalkar generally bowled his full quota of overs and gave up more than 22 runs just twice on the season, incredible consistency from the former USA Captain.\n\nPhani Simhadri, Seattle Thunderbolts\n\nBowling: 46 Wickets, 67.1 Overs, 6.13 Economy, -3.05 Impact per Over\n\nPhani Simhadri’s wicket-taking ability was completely unmatched in 2022 as he produced a lengthy list of eye-popping stats. His 46 wickets were tops in Minor League Cricket, 19 ahead of second place Sarbjeet Singh Ladda at 27 and smashing the 2021 record of 32 wickets, produced by Damion Jacobs. Simhadri did most of his damage at the death, taking 29 wickets across 32.1 death overs, good for a wicket every 6.7 balls. Simhadri played 18 matches this year and took a wicket in every single one of them and took 2+ wickets in all matches except two His wicket-taking didn’t come at the expense of his economy — in the death overs that he specialized in, Simhadri restricted opponent’s scoring by -34% compared to average bowlers in the same match situations.\n\nPranto Ahmed, DC Hawks\n\nBowling: 23 Wickets, 46.1 Overs, 6.15 Economy, -1.64 Impact per Over\n\nPranto Ahmed was one of the breakout stars of Minor League Cricket to start the season. Through the first nine games, Ahmed took 19 wickets at a stellar 4.76 economy across 33.1 overs, good for a wicket every 10.5 balls. In each match in this span, he conceded 24 runs or fewer: great consistency to lead one of the best bowling attacks in the league. Pranto Ahmed also provided a little value with the bat, contributing 138 runs from the lower order, highlighted by a 43 (26) against an elite New Jersey Stallions bowling squad.\n\nSaideep Ganesh, East Bay Blazers (12th Man)\n\nBatting: 402 Runs, 136 Strike Rate, 3 50s, +5.0 Impact per Match\n\nArguably the top youth bat of 2022, Saideep Ganesh had a great season for the East Bay Blazers after coming across town from the Golden State Grizzlies. Ganesh finished the season with 402 runs, the only youth player to break the 400+ run milestone in Minor League Cricket history, doing so at a respectable 136 strike rate. Saideep’s season was highlighted by three half-centuries, the first of which came against one of the top teams in the league, the Silicon Valley Strikers. In that match, Ganesh top-scored at 56 (34) as the Blazers fell just two runs short of handing the Strikers their first loss on the season. His other fifties came in the final two matches of the season off just 32 and 30 balls as the Blazers were in the thick of the playoff chase until the final day.",

        "body": "With the overall Tournament Best and Domestic XI’s already announced, Tom Nielsen now takes a look at the last honorary team from the 2022 Minor League Cricket season, the bight and shiny U-21 players!\n\nDanesh Patel, Manhattan Yorkers\n\nBatting: 395 Runs, 119 Strike Rate, 3 50s\n\nDanesh Patel was the leading run-scorer for a Yorkers team that finished second in the Eastern Division despite significant turnover in their batting lineup during the season. Danesh provided good stability at the top of the order for the Yorkers, enabling teammates such as Bhaskar Yadram, John Campbell, Shawn Findlay and Gajanand Singh to knock it around at 150+ strike rates. But he proved his own ball-striking ability with an outstanding 86* (41) against The Philadelphians, carrying his bat and hitting seven sixes as the Yorkers chased down 187 in just 15.4 overs.\n\nSaideep Ganesh, East Bay Blazers (WK)\n\nBatting: 402 Runs, 136 Strike Rate, 3 50s, +5.0 Impact per Match\n\nSaideep Ganesh had a great season for the East Bay Blazers after coming across town from the Golden State Grizzlies. Ganesh finished the season with 402 runs, the only youth player to break the 400+ run milestone in Minor League Cricket history, doing so at a respectable 136 strike rate. Saideep’s season was highlighted by three half-centuries, the first of which came against one of the top teams in the league, the Silicon Valley Strikers. In that match, Ganesh top-scored at 56 (34) as the Blazers fell just two runs short of handing the Strikers their first loss on the season. His other fifties came in the final two matches of the season off just 32 and 30 balls as the Blazers were in the thick of the playoff chase until the final day.\n\nSaiteja Mukkamalla, New Jersey Stallions\n\nBatting: 302 Runs, 107 Strike Rate, 3 50s\n\nSai Mukkamalla followed up a solid 2021 with very similar per-match numbers in 2022, nudging his strike rate up from 97 to 107 in the process and earning himself a place in the USA squad (and therefore missing some Minor League Cricket time) for their late summer ODI tours. Mukkamalla took home three half-centuries on the season out of the number three spot, highlighted by a solid 53* (41) in a high-pressure playoff match against Morrisville, setting up a 152 total that the Stallions were able to defend by 16 runs.\n\nMuneeb Choudhary, Houston Hurricanes\n\nBatting: 253 Runs, 106 Strike Rate, Top Score 95*\n\nThe second leading scorer for the Hurricanes despite batting in just 10 matches, Muneeb Choudhary went big or went home in 2022. He started the season with a massive bang, smashing 95* (59) against the eventual division champion Dallas Mustangs on opening day, an innings featuring 12 boundaries — seven fours and five sixes. He had three further scores of 35+, including another against the Dallas Mustangs in the middle of the season: unfortunately for Muneeb, the remainder of his matches saw him fall for less than 10.\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi, East Bay Blazers\n\nBowling: 13 Wickets, 31.0 Overs, 5.71 Economy\n\nBatting: 109 Runs, 176 Strike Rate, Top Score 75\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi turned in another great bowling season for the East Bay Blazers, who just barely missed out on a playoff spot in 2022. Though he bowled in just nine matches this year (each of them East Bay victories), Sanjay sported the best economy and second best strike rate on the squad amongst teammates who bowled at least 20 overs. Krishnamurthi took a wicket in all but two matches, highlighted by an early season 4-fer against Golden State to give East Bay a leg up in the playoff race that they’d never give back. Sanjay’s bat disappeared on him a bit this year after a stellar 2021, but he did redeem himself on the penultimate weekend with one of the most outstanding innings across the league all season: a 75 (25) against the Hollywood Master Blasters in the midst of a NRR-impacted playoff chase.\n\nAbhiram Bolisetty, Morrisville Raptors\n\nBatting: 152 Runs, 137 Strike Rate, 10 Sixes\n\nAbhiram Bolisetty was a key cog for the Raptors in 2022, playing in every match but one as they reached the playoffs for a second consecutive year. Bolisetty showed some pop with the bat this year, highlighted by a couple key innings. First was 44 (22) on July 4th, which included an incredible 28-run over (4-2-6-6-4-6) off Noman Iftikhar, who sported a great 6.82 economy on the season. On the penultimate weekend of the season, Bolisetty delivered 27* (16) in a playoff-race match against the Atlanta Fire as part of a rapid-fire 47-run, 24-ball partnership with Matthew Forde to close out the innings and put it out of reach for Atlanta. Bolisetty wasn’t quite able to repeat his bowling excellence of 2021, where he took nine wickets at 7.22 from 32.0 overs, but he shows promising all-round talent going forward.\n\nMatthew Tromp, Houston Hurricanes\n\nBowling: 10 Wickets, 36.0 Overs, 6.78 Economy\n\nBatting: 116 Runs, 113 Strike Rate\n\nMatthew Tromp announced himself on a big way during the July 4th weekend on home soil in Texas, taking 6 wickets for 82 runs across 14 overs at an economy of just 5.86. The highlights were 3/23 against the Blasters, where he took a wicket in each of the 7th, 9th, and 11th overs to stifle Chicago, as well as bowling out Unmukt Chand the following day. Tromp put in some useful runs down the order for the Hurricanes, including a late 44* (28) against Silicon Valley.\n\nHeath Richards, Atlanta Lightning\n\nBowling: 14 Wickets, 30.0 Overs, 8.17 Economy\n\nHeath Richards finished the season as the joint-leading wicket taker for the Atlanta Lightning, carrying the best strike rate on the team and taking a wicket every 12.9 balls on average. Eleven of his 14 wickets came in an excellent four-game stretch deep in the playoff race, taking those 11 wickets from just 14 overs at an economy of 7.71. Richards wasn’t needed too often in the late middle order, though he did contribute 30 (11) from the 6th spot in the order in the penultimate match of the season against Morrisville under the lights at Church Street Park.\n\nSami Sohail, Chicago Tigers\n\nBowling: 22 Wickets, 52.5 Overs, 8.20 Economy\n\nBatting: 142 Runs, 112 Strike Rate, 8 Sixes\n\nSami Sohail was the leading youth wicket-taker of Minor League Cricket in 2022, taking 22 wickets and specializing in death bowling. 12 of his 22 wickets came at the death, good for a wicket every 12 balls on average. Sohail also took back-to-back four-wicket hauls in the middle of the season: 4/29 against the Michigan Cricket stars and an outstanding 6/33 against the Dallas Mustangs. Sohail provided some big runs late on multiple occasions against big competition-17* (7) in a mid-season win against Dallas, followed up by 33* (20) in a winning effort in game two of the Conference Semi-finals against the Silicon Valley Strikers.\n\nAditya Padala, Morrisville Raptors\n\nBowling: 15 Wickets, 37.0 Overs, 7.41 Economy\n\nAditya Padala was a key member of a deep and talented Morrisville Raptors bowling attack, finishing as the joint-leading wicket-taker and bowling the second most overs on the squad. The left-arm pace bowler excelled in the power play, taking seven wickets across 16 overs at a tight 6.81 economy, all good for a bowling impact of -2.69 runs per over in the phase. Padala performed well under pressure in the playoffs, taking two wickets for 22 runs in game two of the Conference Semi-finals, the wickets being USA National Teamers Dominique Rikhi and Sai Mukkamalla in the powerplay. Though he was rarely needed with the bat, he did help lead the Raptors to victory with 17* (6) in the final three overs of a thrilling chase of 188 against the Atlanta Lightning in the penultimate weekend of the season.\n\nAteendra Subramanian, Atlanta Fire\n\nBowling: 13 Wickets, 44.5 Overs, 7.41 Economy\n\nAteendra Subramanian was a core member of the Atlanta Fire bowling attack, one of just five Fire players who saw more than 15 overs of action in the regular season. Subramanian saw most of his action in the middle overs, with a tight 6.62 economy across 24 overs helping to slow down opponents’ innings. He took home two three-wicket hauls on the season, both in winning efforts-3/21 against the Orlando Galaxy mid-season, and 3/26 against the Morrisville Raptors on the final weekend in the climax of the playoff hunt. He also claimed the key wicket of Anthony Bramble in the powerplay of the Atlantic Conference Finals, a wicket the Stallions never recovered from as they failed to chase down the Fire’s total.\n\nAli Sheikh, Dallas Mustangs (12th Man)\n\nBowling: 12 Wickets, 26.0 Overs, 7.92 Economy, -0.71 Impact per Over\n\nBatting: 113 Runs, 105 Strike Rate\n\nAs a bowler, Ali Sheikh did most of his damage in the middle and death overs, restricting opponents’ totals by -1.2 runs per over in those stages while taking a wicket every 12.5 balls. In all, his bowling strike rate was second on the Mustangs to just Nosh Kenjige. In his first seven matches, Ali Sheikh took eight wickets from just 17 overs at an outstanding 6.35 economy. But difficult situations in a few late matches against the playoff-hungry Michigan Cricket Stars and Seattle Thunderbolts inflated his season-long economy.",

        "title": "Thunderbolts Stun Strikers to Win Pacific Title – Minor League Cricket News",
        "date": "Sat Aug 27 00:00:00 2022",
        "body": "Nine weeks of Minor League Cricket this summer has taught us that many different things can happen over a blank sheet of 40 overs.\n\nThe 13-1 Silicon Valley Strikers were the class of the league, and a year after lifting the trophy, they were back at Church Street Park to try and claim the 2022 Toyota Minor League Cricket Season presented by Sunoco.\n\nComing from the Pacific Northwest, however, were the men in pink and blue from Seattle. The Thunderbolts had clawed and scrapped and earned their way to Morrisville with skill and desire.\n\nThat Silicon Valley won both regular season matches with Seattle was meaningless now. In a knock-out format, it’s black and white. Win today, or go home.\n\nAnd thanks to a stout knock from Rishi Bhardwaj, and a superb bowling and fielding effort, it was Seattle who claimed the Pacific Conference title, playing their way into Sunday’s Championship Final.\n\nHarmeet Singh won the toss and elected to bat, feeling that the warm conditions on the quick Church Street outfield would help continue the flow of runs that spewed forth in the Dallas series. The opening pairing of Rayyan Khan Pathan and Andries Gous had helped carry the Thunderbolts to this juncture of the tournament.\n\nBut to continue their success, they had to deal with the deadly attack of West Indian veteran Fidel Edwards and US National Teamer Saurabh Netravalkar. Edwards removed Pathan in the second over for five runs, Pathan’s lowest output in his five matches with Seattle. Then Netravalkar bowled Shubham Ranjane all-ends-up with the inning’s fifteenth ball, and when Edwards induced captain Singh to hole out in the fifth over, it appeared the Thunderbolts power play had been short circuited.\n\nSeattle needed a lightning rod, and they got it in Bhardwaj. It had been nine matches since the Indian batter notched the last of his three half-centuries, and he anchored himself in the crease to help build up the total. Bhardwaj found holes in the Strikers field, and formed a partnership with Shadley Van Schalkwyk of 68 runs, ending the innings in the middle on 66* from 47. Edwards took a 3-fer though was expensive, giving up 55 runs, and Netravalkar ended with a pair of wickets.\n\nThanks in part to Bhardwaj’s stewardship, Seattle totaled 155/7, right around a par for the pitch, but one felt it might not be enough against the mighty Silicon Valley lineup.\n\nIt seemed to be business as usual for the Strikers openers, as they feasted on Van Schalkwyk’s bowling on the familiar turf wicket for twenty runs in his first two overs. In spite of that, the Strikers were kept to 44/1 at the end of the power play. With two of the top scorers in MiLC in Unmukt Chand and Shehan Jayasuriya at the crease, however, there was still an inherent advantage to the Californians.\n\nSeattle had had their backs to the wall for pretty much the last month of the season. From the struggle for second place in the West with the East Bay Blazers, having to win two from two in Texas against Dallas Mustangs last weekend, the Thunderbolts bowlers thrived on pressure. Jayasuriya was trapped LBW for 12 off the bowling of Phani Simhadri, and Chand fell not long after for 24, caught off the bowling of Shubham Ranjane.\n\n1,385 runs may have been sent back to the shed, but now there was the specter of Simmons, Pranay Suri, and Gary Graham still lurking. Simmons and Suri brought things back on terms with a 52 run stand before Simmons went for a top score of 39. Even though Silicon Valley still needed 51 runs off of the last 33 deliveries, there seemed to be little doubt that the defending champs would be able to defend their title on Sunday night.\n\nThat doubt, however, grew with the wicket of Graham. The Jamaican List-A alumni thrives in scenarios where the game is on the line, and it seemed like this was tailor made for the 40-year-old veteran from Trewlawny. Simhadri had other ideas. With eight wickets in last weekend’s Dallas series, and a league high 41 from sixteen games in 2022, Simahdri was here to assert his own dominance. He was able to get Graham to sky out to Van Schalkwyk, and now it was up to the Strikers’ tail to get them 30 from 35 balls.\n\nSuddenly, this was now one of those Morrisville Magic type matches as the clouds rolled in. The equation dwindled down to 11 runs from the final over, and van Schalkwyk was given the ball. The South African rising star had recovered from his power play nightmare with two nice catches in the field, and it was on his shoulders to get his team to the final hurdle.\n\nThree singles reduced the target to seven. On the fourth ball, Narsingh Deonarine popped one up into the hands of Akhilesh Bodugum. After Suri was run out trying to stretch one run into two and force the game into a situation where a six would win the contest, Kulvinder Singh now needed a maximum just to keep the Strikers alive in a super over. His strike was true, but fell short at long on. The chase came six runs short, and there will be a new MilC champion crowned in 2022.\n\nThe sun was still peeking through the clouds, but thunder rang out around the scenic ground. Seattle had done it.\n\n“I think our team has peaked at the right time,” said Thunderbolts captain Harmeet Singh. “The way we played in the field showed character from the boys and the way we fielded right from ball one and the way we took wickets was very important.”\n\nThere was of course disappointment for Seattle’s west coast opponents. “We were on track, some mistakes here and there. I think [Seattle] played very well, they bowled well, so they’re on the winning side,” said Strikers captain Chand. “We’d been sensational through the tournament, we’d only lost two games. I think it’s been a great show by everyone. We just couldn’t do it today.”\n\nBharwaj’s stoicism at the crease, and his grit after an apparent injury in the field, netted him Player of the Match honors. “I’m really excited our team won,” he said. “Everything is good now.”",

        "date": "Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 2021",
        "body": "The final installment of a four-part series (also including youth, domestic and playoffs Best XIs), majorleaguecricket.com has selected the tournament’s overall best XI from the 2021 Toyota Minor League Cricket Championship presented by Sling TV.\n\n1. Unmukt Chand (Silicon Valley Strikers) (C)\n\nM: 16 | Runs: 612 | Ave: 51.00 | SR: 125.15 | HS: 132no | 100s: 1 | 50s: 5\n\nThe skipper of the Silicon Valley Strikers took the tournament by storm after joining prior to Round 3. He provided one of the highlights of the tournament with his unbeaten 132 off only 59 balls in an elimination match against the Austin Athletics. It was also Chand’s consistency, passing 50 six times in only 16 innings, that saw him finish the tournament as the leading run scorer in the Pacific Conference. His captaincy of the Strikers, who won the championship, means that he leads this side.\n\n2. Ryan Scott (Michigan Cricket Stars)\n\nM: 14 | Runs: 446 | Ave: 34.31 | SR: 181.30 | HS: 118 | 100s: 2 | 50s: 1\n\nAfter featuring in the MiLC Domestic team of the tournament, Ryan Scott was simply too destructive at the top order to leave out of this side. It was a brilliant 118 off only 48 deliveries against a Houston Hurricanes attack featuring Ali Khan, Karthik Gattepalli and Willem Ludick that caught the attention of most, smacking 13 sixes along the way. He finished the season with an incredible 38 sixes to lead the Pacific Conference.\n\n3. Trevon Griffith (Empire State Titans)\n\nM: 18 | Runs: 566 | Ave: 37.73 | SR: 148.56 | HS: 87 | 100s: 0 | 50s: 5\n\nWkts: 14 | Ave: 15.43 | Econ: 5.84 | BBI: 4/9\n\nThe experienced Guyanese opening batsman was one of the key contributors to the Empire State Titans reaching the National Finals in Morrisville. Almost every team in the Eastern Division felt the force of Griffith, as he passed 50 five times and collected four player of the match awards over the course of the season. He also contributed with the ball, taking 14 wickets with his off-spin at a miserly economy rate of 5.84 runs per over.\n\n4. Xavier Marshall (New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers)\n\nM: 15 | Runs: 542 | Ave: 41.69 | SR: 147.28 | HS: 105 | 100s: 1 | 50s: 4\n\nAnother member of our MiLC Domestic team of the tournament, the evergreen batsman often played a lone hand for the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers during the 2021 MiLC season. The highlight of Marshall’s season came against the New England Eagles in Round 6, smashing an incredible 105 off only 50 deliveries. Marshall finished with the most sixes across both conferences, clearing the rope a remarkable 47 times throughout his campaign.\n\n5. Sujith Gowda (East Bay Blazers)\n\nM: 14 | Runs: 481 | Ave: 37.00 | SR: 147.55 | HS: 93 | 100s: 0 | 50s: 4\n\nGowda is batting lower in this team than his preferred No. 3 position, but the classical right-hander had to be squeezed into this side after an impressive campaign for the East Bay Blazers. Leading the runs in the Pacific Conference through the end of the regular season, Gowda collected three player of the match awards including two against the San Diego Surf Riders, who will be hoping he is in a different division in 2022.\n\n6. Christopher Barnwell (Empire State Titans)\n\nM: 16 | Runs: 559 | Ave: 50.82 | SR: 151.49 | HS: 114 | 100s: 1 | 50s: 2\n\nWkts: 15 | Ave: 19.27 | Econ: 6.62 | BBI: 3/8\n\nBarnwell was dominant this season, with the former West-Indian all-rounder leading the Empire State Titans to the Atlantic Conference Championship Match. He hit his straps through the middle of the season, putting the Manhattan Yorkers to the sword with innings of 114 not out and 76 not out, collecting two consecutive player of the match awards for his efforts. He also made significant contributions with the ball in hand, taking three-wicket hauls on three occasions. Barnwell finished the season with 45 maximums, just two behind Xavier Marshall at the top of the leaderboard.\n\n7. Hammad Azam (Golden State Grizzlies)\n\nM: 17 | Runs: 411 | Ave: 51.38 | SR: 184.30 | HS: 69 | 100s: 0 | 50s: 3\n\nWkts: 12 | Ave: 25.25 | Econ: 5.83 | BBI: 3/9\n\nWith a strike rate of over 180 combined with an extraordinary average of over 50 for the season, it was no wonder that Hammad Azam was ranked at the top of the MiLC Impact Rankings compiled by Tom Nielsen. Azam was nothing short of destructive with the bat through the course of the 2021 season, with the highlight being his 15-ball half century against the Chicago Blasters in Round 6 of the season. He was also a big contributor with the ball for the Golden State Grizzlies, picking up 12 scalps with his medium pace.\n\n8. Shadley van Schalkwyk (Seattle Thunderbolts)\n\nM: 17 | Runs: 259 | Ave: 28.78 | SR: 104.86 | HS: 79* | 100s: 0 | 50s: 1\n\nWkts: 20 | Ave: 12.55 | Econ: 4.83 | BBI: 2/2\n\nVan Schalkwyk was virtually unplayable with the ball in hand this season, finishing the season as the second highest ranked bowler on MiLC’s Player Impact Rankings. This is largely due to his economy rate of 4.83, which is made even more remarkable by virtue of the fact that he was often tasked with bowling in the Powerplay and at the death for the Seattle Thunderbolts. Van Schalkwyk also made some hay with the bat for the Thunderbolts, the highlight being a match-winning 79 not out against the Silicon Valley Strikers in their Round 7 clash to finish the Thunderbolts’ inaugural season on a high.\n\n9. Corne Dry (Atlanta Fire)\n\nM: 16 | Wkts: 30 | Ave: 14.07 | Econ: 7.03 | BBI: 4/10 | SR: 12.0 | 4WI: 2\n\nThe captain of the Atlanta Fire led from the front with the ball during the 2021 MiLC campaign, winning MVP in the Southern Division and finishing the tournament as the second-highest wicket taker overall. He started the season with four-wicket hauls in two of his first three matches, including 4/10 against the Morrisville Cardinals in front of a big crowd at Church Street Park in Round 2 to win player of the match honors. He was a consistent wicket-taking option for the Fire throughout the season, failing to take a wicket in only three of his 16 matches.\n\n10. Damion Jacobs (Empire State Titans)\n\nM: 15 | Wkts: 32 | Ave: 12.34 | Econ: 6.39 | BBI: 5/16 | SR: 11.6 | 4WI: 1\n\nOne of the four players to feature in both the Domestic XI & Team of the Tournament, Jacobs was unstoppable for the Empire State Titans during the 2021 season, leading the tournament in wickets and striking less than every two overs. His leg-spin was a key factor in the Empire State Titans ride to the playoffs, taking three wickets or more on four occasions in his team’s run of seven consecutive wins through the middle of the season. The highlight was Jacobs’ five-wicket haul against the Manhattan Yorkers at Church Street Park in Round 6, where he ripped through the middle order on his way to 5/16 off 3 overs.\n\n11. Vatsal Vaghela (Golden State Grizzlies)\n\nM: 17 | Wkts: 29 | Ave: 11.41 | Econ: 5.49 | BBI: 4/13 | SR: 12.5 | 4WI: 1\n\nThe only player to feature in all three of the teams selected by majorleaguecricket.com, Vatsal Vaghela was one of the key ingredients that led the Golden State Grizzlies to the National Finals in Morrisville. The young left-arm spinner from the Bay Area was unstoppable in the early stages of the season, collecting 16 wickets in his first six games, including a player of the match performance of 4/13 in the season opener against the Seattle Thunderbolts. Nobody had more wickets in the Pacific Conference during the 2021 season, with Vaghela putting his name firmly up in lights for higher honors.\n\n12th Man: Willem Ludick (Houston Hurricanes)\n\nM: 14 | Runs: 471 | Ave: 47.10 | SR: 143.60 | HS: 60 | 100s: 0 | 50s: 5\n\nLudick’s exploits with the bat were a huge factor in the Hurricanes progressing through to the Semi-finals in the Pacific Conference this season, passing 50 on five occasions throughout the season. The powerful right-hander finished the season as the fifth highest run-scorer in the Pacific Conference, as well as the fifth ranked batsman in MiLC’s player impact rankings, with the highlight being his unbeaten 51 off just 32 balls against the Hollywood Master Blasters in Round 6.",
        "summary": "The article reveals the best XI players from the 2021 Toyota Minor League Cricket Championship, presented by Sling TV. The team is led by Unmukt Chand of the Silicon Valley Strikers, who was the tournament's leading run-scorer in the Pacific Conference.

        "body": "The second season of the Toyota Minor League Cricket Championship (MiLC) presented by Sunoco will come to a thrilling conclusion on Sunday, Aug. 28, at scenic Church Street Park in Morrisville, NC. The Seattle Thunderbolts and the Atlanta Fire will meet in a one-game championship final under the lights at 5 p.m., set to be broadcast live on the MLC Network YouTube channel and Willow TV. A grand prize of $150,000, the largest in American cricket history, will go to the 2022 Toyota Minor League Cricket Champions.\n\nThe final match at Church Street Park, located only 15 miles from downtown Raleigh, is free to attend tomorrow. Fans will have the opportunity to meet and greet with the stars of Minor League Cricket, enjoy local food trucks, music and a family activity zone.\n\nThe Pacific Conference title was claimed on Saturday afternoon by the Seattle Thunderbolts, who knocked out the defending champions, the Silicon Valley Strikers, in a matinee matchup. Seattle’s six-run victory came after the Thunderbolts set a total of 155 for the Strikers to chase. Rishi Bhardwaj had a top score of 66 from 47 balls, earning Player of the Match honors. Fidel Edwards led in wickets for Silicon Valley, taking three, albeit at an expensive economy rate, conceding 52 runs from his four overs.\n\nThe Strikers’ run chase did not reach high gear, with marquee stars Unmukt Chand (24), Shehan Jayasuriya (12) and Lendl Simmons (39) unable to ignite as they had earlier in the season that had seen Silicon Valley lose only two matches of 17 played. The Strikers entered the final over with 11 runs needed to win, falling short by six after an economical over bowled by Shadley Van Schalkwyk. Phani Simhadri, the top wicket taker of the 2022 MiLC season, was again Seattle’s most effective bowler, claiming two wickets while only conceding 17 runs from his four overs.\n\nSeattle’s upset victory will see them take on the Atlanta Fire, who won the Atlantic Championship on Saturday under the lights at Church Street Park with a dominant 96-run victory over last year’s finalists, the New Jersey Stallions. Atlanta’s batting firepower was once again on display, with captain Aaron Jones top scoring on 76 unbeaten from only 46 balls, helping his team to set a total of 210 runs and winning the Player of the Match award. A partnership of 102 between Jones and Jahmar Hamilton, who smashed 54 from only 29 balls, proved to be the decisive combination in the match.\n\nNew Jersey started their response quickly with opener Anthony Bramble hitting a fast 33, but wickets rapidly tumbled with the Stallions bowled out for only 114 from 17.1 overs, Sai Mukkamalla top scoring with 34 from 24 balls. The Fire’s standout bowler was Evroy Dyer, who claimed four wickets in a 3.1 over spell that also only yielded 13 runs.\n\nThe victories by Atlanta and Seattle sets up a marquee clash for Sunday evening, with the championship final set to begin at 5 p.m. ET. The match and broadcast schedule at Church Street Park is as follows:\n\nCHAMPIONSHIP FINAL\n\nSeattle Thunderbolts vs. Atlanta Fire\n\nSunday, Aug. 28, 5 p.m. ET\n\nLive broadcast on Willow TV and the MLC Network YouTube Channel",

        "date": "Fri Oct  8 00:00:00 2021",
        "body": "I’m doing something a little different in this edition of All Things Cricket. Instead of the usual rundown of the week’s news, I’m going to review the 2021 season in Minor League Cricket, the USA’s most recent attempt at a professional T20 league.\n\nIt’s probably a huge surprise to anyone reading this who is not already a cricket fan that 27 teams in 20 cities played over 200 games of cricket this summer/fall and a national champion was crowned (I’m stealing this copy almost completely from the Sling TV ads, which ran constantly during the tournament – Sling TV, Official Sponsor of Minor League Cricket!). But that really did happen, and this is a review of what happened. While you were all getting emotionally invested in taped-delayed sports you didn’t know the rules of from Tokyo, guys were playing a sport you didn’t know the rules of, live, right here.\n\nWe must start with the team names, which ranged from inspiring to clever to what’s-that-now? to trite and overused.\n\nAtlantic Conference, Eastern Division\n\nDC Hawks (eh, been done)\n\nEmpire State Titans (old Jets name homage?)\n\nManhattan Yorkers (first of many “cricket glossary” terms – a Yorker is a delivery bowled near the batter’s feet)\n\nNew England Eagles (‘Murica!)\n\nNew Jersey Somerset Cavaliers (I like this one: it weirdly has the city after the state but it’s classy, and I’m partial to Somerset)\n\nNew Jersey Stallions (after Megan Thee of course, I assume)\n\nThe Philadelphians (by far the best name – also sounds a like a club Randolph and Mortimer Duke would belong to)\n\nAtlantic Conference, Southern Division\n\nAtlanta Fire (on the nose for all you “Gone With The Wind” fans)\n\nAtlanta Param Veers (Param Veer is the highest military honor awarded in India – so don’t talk about Pakistan around these guys)\n\nFlorida Beamers (a beamer is a delivery bowled at the batter’s head – like naming a team “Beanballs”, so kind of menacing)\n\nFort Lauderdale Lions (also the nickname of the Sri Lanka cricket team, which is probably not a coincidence)\n\nMorrisville Cardinals (they were going for “best fans in cricket” honors)\n\nOrlando Galaxy (meh)\n\nPacific Conference, Central Division\n\nAustin Athletics (aspirational – cricket in the US is not yet particularly athletic, but it’s getting there)\n\nHouston Hurricanes (Hurricane Ida came through and no games were called off, so it worked as a talisman to ward off actual hurricanes, I guess)\n\nChicago Blasters (they didn’t)\n\nChicago Catchers (they also didn’t – and why not Keepers, which is a real position in cricket and has a double meaning?)\n\nIrving Mustangs (for the stunning Mustangs of Las Colinas statue, so this was another one I liked – only people from Irving or who have been to Irving would appreciate it)\n\nMichigan Cricket Stars (they weren’t, but they played well)\n\nSt. Louis Americans (Double-down ‘Murica!)\n\nPacific Conference, Western Division\n\nEast Bay Blazers (like the Hurricanes, several games were affected – but not caused to be abandoned – by smoke from nearby wildfires)\n\nGolden State Grizzlies (a merging of two NBA franchises that would be very strange)\n\nHollywood Master Blasters (sadly, they didn’t play the Chicago Blasters and were unable to display their mastery over them)\n\nSan Diego Surf Riders (best name in the Western Conference by far – although I don’t think there is any crossover with surfing and cricket outside of Australia)\n\nSeattle Thunderbolts (not bad, original-ish at least)\n\nSilicon Valley Strikers (funny because Silicon Valley famously has poor or no unions – yes, it’s another cricket glossary term – the striker is the guy batting at any given time)\n\nSoCal Lashings (this was the most “what the?” name for me. I guess lashing is a term for batting? No idea)\n\nThis is Minor League Cricket’s second season, but this was the first one where a championship was played. The 2020 season was cut short by COVID travel restrictions to teams playing each other within their own region, and the matches had a pickup-game feel, with few of them shown on YouTube and no real social media presence or any sense that it was building to anything. The league used the games to do a trial run of how they would manage and operate so many games simultaneously and at least try to get them all on YouTube.\n\nThe league is owned by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), who also run the only cricket streaming channel in the US, Willow TV. Willow mostly brings in satellite feeds from major broadcasters like Sky in the UK, Star in India, and Channel 9 in Australia, slaps some ads in between overs (some of them amazingly hilarious, like a guy named Prem Jyotish who sells astrology readings in California) and collects $12/month or $60/year from subscribers. It’s a slick operation and you would have to say that Americans are incredibly spoiled to be able to watch cricket almost every day of the year from all over the world on Willow. The Willow folks aren’t (or at least weren’t) skilled in running multiple live internet feeds from all over a vast country like the US. The first season was a study in amateurism. At one point, they had a pre-game feed running on YouTube of an empty field with two guys yelling and swearing at each other off-camera for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe 2021 season seemed very different from the start. First, there would be playoffs, a final game, and a champion. Secondly, the league hired a social media coordinator and they made a decent effort to reach out to fans (mostly league and team employees, the team owners, the players, their families and friends, and about a dozen or so white guys like me) and to update the website with details on the fixtures. The 2021 season began on Saturday, July 31st. I attended the first competitive game ever played between rivals Austin and Houston at Moosa Stadium in Pearland, TX. Why Pearland, which is 30 miles from Houston (the Hurricanes play their home games in Prairie View, about 50 miles from Houston) and some 140 miles from Austin? That’s because the owner of Moosa Stadium, a car dealer named Sakhi Muhammad, asked Austin if they would play games there and they accepted, not having a real turf pitch of their own to play on.\n\nLack of real turf pitches is a real problem in the US. The pitch is the 22-yard by 10-yard strip in the center of the field where most of the action happens. Cricket playing nations like England, India, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, etc. have numerous stadiums and county/state grounds with grandstands and clubhouses, and these grounds have a set of real turf pitches side-by-side in the center of the field that they rotate in and out of service during the season. In the US, in many locations, there are often only patches of grass that have been set aside within a large park for cricket with no facilities or stands, and someone has installed a single slab of concrete in the center and glued a layer of FieldTurf or a rubber mat over the concrete to make a pitch. The artificial pitches provide a simulacrum of real cricket, but a major part of the charm of the game is the variability and changeability of an organically grown surface on which to play. It’s like the real vs. artificial turf debate in football and baseball raised to a much higher level. The International Cricket Council (ICC), like FIFA, will not allow play on the artificial stuff for international matches.\n\nArtificial turf/rubber mat pitches prevailed in the Atlantic Conference even this season, and there were several of them out west as well. The league is strongly encouraging the ownership groups to install real turf pitches to the point where one team had to travel to play an opponent who had a real turf pitch for the quarterfinals even though they finished in 1st place in their division and their opponent finished in 2nd place. Moosa Stadium is one of two facilities in the Houston area with real turf pitches and was a logical selection for a franchise. For whatever reason, ACE granted the franchise to a group from Austin without verifying that they had a place to play. Austin’s loss was Mr. Muhammad’s gain, although he still can’t charge admission at this point.\n\nA team-by-team review:\n\nAtlantic Conference, Eastern Division\n\nNew Jersey Stallions – home ground: Howe Athletic Ground, Somerset, NJ\n\n1st place; 11-4-1 no result, 46 points\n\nThe Stallions lost their first two games and were at a disappointing 3-4 after seven games. Something flipped, and they didn’t lose again in the regular season. They got great contributions from youngsters Raymond Ramrattan (19) and Sai Mukkamala (17), who led the team in runs scored with 367. Stephen Wiig led in wickets with 27. Jessy Singh and Dominique Rikhi had to leave mid-season for USA Cricket national team duty but made it back for the playoffs.\n\nEmpire State Titans – home ground: Idlewild Park, Queens, NY\n\n2nd place; 9-4-3 no result; 42 points\n\nEmpire State lost two early games to the Stallions, then picked it up and led most of the rest of the way until a huge late-season loss against Manhattan that could have clinched them the division. One important game for them was in Orlando, when the FieldTurf matting came unglued in the second innings and the game had to be abandoned. It was a real low point for the league in general. Christopher Barnwell and Trevon Griffith were their best players. A statistician named Tom Nielsen compiled “impact” ratings for the league, combining runs scored as a batter and runs prevented as a bowler over expected runs scored and allowed, and Barnwell finished 2nd overall and Griffith 4th. In addition, Damion Jacobs led the league in wickets with 32 (including the Titans’ postseason games).\n\nThe Philadelphians – home ground: Exton Park, Exton, PA\n\n3rd place; 8-5-3 no result; 38 points\n\nThe Philadelphians challenged for a playoff spot all season but lost a critical game to the Cavaliers on September 11th and were beaten by the Stallions in their last regular season game to finally end their post-season chances. Jonathan Foo, an Indian-Chinese player from Guyana (you see a lot of guys with internationally diverse backgrounds in cricket), and the team’s best player, led two incredible comeback wins in consecutive weekends against Florida and DC, but it wasn’t quite enough. Against Florida, Foo charged the comms box and knocked over the Willow camera after hitting the winning six.\n\nManhattan Yorkers – home ground: Canarsie Park, Brooklyn, NY\n\n4th place; 8-7-1 no result; 34 points\n\nManhattan was another team that faded at the end after a good early start. Their opener was a 118-run win over Orlando, and they were 4-1-1 after six matches. They went 3-6 after that to take themselves out of contention but were able to knock Empire State out of 1st place with a final-game win on the last ball. Raj Nannan was the only Yorker to finish in the top 20 in either bowling or batting impact ratings.\n\nDC Hawks – home ground: Veterans Memorial Park, Woodbridge, VA\n\n5th place; 8-8-0 no result; 32 points\n\nDC had some wild games, including the crushing loss to The Philadelphians and Foo, and a 2-wicket squeaker over Empire State when they were only chasing 75. They were blown out a couple of times, also by Empire State and by the Cavaliers, and then returned the favor on the Cavaliers in the next-to-last weekend. They couldn’t get any consistency and never really challenged. Ravi Inder Singh Mehra finished 13th in overall impact with 564 runs scored and 10 wickets.\n\nNew Jersey Somerset Cavaliers – home ground: Howe Athletic Ground, Somerset, NJ\n\n6th place; 7-8-1 no result; 30 points\n\nSomerset (my favorite English County team, so that’s what I’ll call them) posted the highest single game total for the whole league against Atlanta Param Veers in the first weekend of the season with 252 runs, and looked to be a side to be reckoned with, but once play started within the Eastern Division, they never got a foothold. The low point was a 62-run drubbing by DC in their last weekend of the regular season followed by another bad loss to Empire State to close out the campaign. Muhammad Asad Ghous and USA player Xavier Marshall led the club in overall impact.\n\nNew England Eagles – home ground: Keney Park, Hartford, CT\n\n7th place; 5-10-1 no result; 22 points\n\nNew England, coming from central Connecticut, a decent bus ride from the teams in the NY/NJ metroplex, didn’t get a home game until September 12th. They struggled mightily against their own division, going 2-10 with a huge 173-run clobbering by Empire State on September 11th. They’ll need to improve their home situation going forward or could be a candidate for a move or something worse. Rizwan Mazhar was the only player in the top 20 of either bowling or batting impact.\n\nAtlantic Conference, Southern Division\n\nAtlanta Fire – home ground: Atlanta Cricket Fields, Cumming, GA\n\n1st place; 11-4-1 no result; 46 points\n\nThe Fire were on fire from the outset, with a loaded team including USA players Steven Taylor and Aaron Jones and highly regarded South African bowler Corne Dry. They had a miserable weekend in Florida on 8/21 and 8/22, losing to also-rans the Beamers and Galaxy, but then rebounded with three straight wins before another puzzling loss to the Eagles. They won their last three and easily won the division. Amila Aponso and Dry were the high-impact players for the Fire, finishing 6th and 7th overall.\n\nMorrisville Cardinals – home ground: Church Street Park, Morrisville, NC\n\n2nd place; 7-7-0 no result; 28 points\n\nMorrisville is the crown jewel franchise in Minor League Cricket, boasting a real turf pitch in a picturesque ground with actual fans who come to the games and even a few amenities like beer and food trucks. Morrisville is a rapidly growing city in the North Carolina Research Triangle with many South Asian immigrants. The team had very high hopes and were playing well until Jaskaran Malhotra was called up for USA duty, after which their season collapsed. They lost four-in-a-row to finish the regular season and barely held off Orlando for the 2nd playoff spot in the division. Malhotra was a beast when he played, finishing 5th in overall impact, and they couldn’t find a replacement when he left.\n\nOrlando Galaxy – home ground: Silverstar Recreation Center, Orlando, FL\n\n3rd place; 4-4-6 no result; 28 points\n\nYes, a whopping SIX no results due to the Sunshine State’s predictable rainy tropical weather and the incident against Empire State when the artificial turf came unglued. This is another team that needs an improved home situation, and in their case, they have a part-owner named Mangesh Choudari who manages the pristine real turf pitch facility in Prairie View, TX and who has made himself the leading pitch expert within USA Cricket. I expect much better results from them next year. This year, nobody made a large impact in either bowling or batting, but they were able to scrape together four wins and almost made the playoffs. Tagenarine Chanderpaul was the leading run-scorer with 260 and Ramone Medwinter had 9 wickets.\n\nAtlanta Param Veers – home ground: Param Veers Cricket Field, Rydal, GA\n\n4th place; 4-7-4 no result; 22 points\n\nThis Atlanta team lacked fire, both figuratively and name-wise. They were victims of the highest first-innings score in the league by the Cavaliers in the first weekend and didn’t get a win until the fourth weekend. They had two straight matches in Orlando abandoned after scoring 247/1 and 106/2 in the 9th over, both of which would have likely been wins if not for weather. They needed to sweep the rival Fire in the last weekend to make the playoffs and lost both games in the 20th over. Nothing much went right, but they seem to have a decent club and could easily bounce back next season. They opened a new real turf pitch facility near Cartersville, GA, hometown of Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence, and are adding to the facility over the next few years to make it a USA Cricket hub. Zain Sayed finished 8th in overall impact this season.\n\nFort Lauderdale Lions – home ground: Broward County Stadium, Lauderhill, FL\n\n5th place; 4-8-2 no result; 20 points\n\nFort Lauderdale also has no home ground problems. Broward County Stadium is the only ICC-approved stadium in the country and has hosted international matches featuring India, Sri Lanka, and the West Indies, in addition to Caribbean Premier League games. It is by far the best cricket-watching facility in the US. Despite that, the Lions struggled from the first weekend. They somehow beat Morrisville at the other top-class facility in this division, Church Street Park, but the wins were scarce after that. The next day after beating Morrisville, they were bowled out for 70 by the Cardinals and lost in the 11th over. No one dented the top 20 in overall, bowling, or batting impact. Devendra Bishoo led all bowlers on the Lions with 14 wickets and the leading scorer was Roy Silva with 274 runs.\n\nFlorida Beamers – home ground: MAQ Cricket Stadium, Delray Beach, FL\n\n6th place; 1-11-2 no result; 8 points\n\nThe Beamers are owned by a swashbuckling cricket entrepreneur named Mahammad Ahmad Qureshi (MAQ for short) who named his stadium (not a real turf pitch) and his son, who plays for the Beamers, after himself. It was a dismal year for the Beamers, but knowing MAQ, they will bounce back and be a force in the future. Asim Khursid was an impact player with the bat but not much else went their way. They won a stunner on September 28th against the Param Veers as their only win.\n\nPacific Conference, Central Division\n\nAustin Athletics – home ground: Moosa Stadium, Pearland, TX\n\n1st place; 12-2-1 no result; 50 points\n\nThis is my home team and I attended several games at Moosa. Moosa is set amid a trailer park and a lot of scrub brush, but it is one of the most complete facilities in the US as far as having home and away changing rooms, practice nets, seating for a limiting number of spectators, a playground and lately, a practice field in the back. Most of the buildings are in a state of disrepair, but that it ever got built is a miracle, and Mr. Muhammad is doing all he can to keep the place relevant, signing the Athletics this year and possibly in the future. Austin had a spectacular inaugural season, tying with the Golden State Grizzlies for most points accrued. Their opener against Houston which I attended was a shocking loss. Houston needed 10 runs off the last two deliveries, which is almost impossible. Austin’s Ali Bangash was bowling, and he did the unthinkable and bowled a head-high no-ball, which the Hurricanes’ Usman Rafiq somehow miraculously hit behind him over the boundary for six runs plus one for the no-ball. This left a free hit and a final delivery for Houston to get the last three runs, which they did easily. Austin only lost one more time after that in the regular season and beat Houston on the final ball in the next-to-last weekend and Irving for their final regular season game to win the division. Awais Zia was the big gun for Austin, finishing 15th in overall impact.\n\nHouston Hurricanes – home ground: Prairie View Cricket Complex, Prairie View, TX\n\n2nd place; 12-3-0 no result; 48 points\n\nPrairie View Cricket Complex is the lifelong dream realized of owner Tanweer Ahmed, who also owns many Yum! Brands franchises in the Houston area. It now has eight cricket fields, five with real turf pitches, and is already a hub for USA Cricket. It sits within view of the Prairie View A&M football stadium, about 50 miles northwest of downtown Houston. The Hurricanes obviously benefited mightily from getting to play and practice at this sprawling facility, amassing 48 points and never being below 2nd place. Despite the incredible opening comeback win against rivals Austin, they couldn’t quite pass the Athletics and ended up losing to them in the next-to-last weekend to put them in a situation where they needed help from Irving to win the division, which they didn’t get. They lost gun bowler Ali Khan for most of the year when he went off to play in the CPL, but they got very strong seasons from USA U21 player Karthik Gattepalli and South African import Willem Ludick.\n\nMichigan Cricket Stars – home ground: Lyon Oaks Cricket Ground, Wixom, MI\n\n2nd place; 10-3-2 no result; 44 points\n\nMichigan was the surprise team of the tournament. The Wolverine State is not a cricket hotbed, with long winters and not many grounds to play on. Somehow, owner Nabeel Ahmed put together a very strong team with Jamaican-American Ryan Scott at the forefront. Scott was third in overall impact, scoring 446 runs. Nicholas Kirton chipped in as a bowler, taking 19 wickets. The Cricket Stars split with Houston and lost both games to Austin, which doomed their playoff hopes, and even a last-weekend sweep of the Blasters wasn’t enough.\n\nIrving Mustangs – home ground: Sandy Lake Cricket Ground, Carrollton, TX\n\n4th place; 6-7-2 no result; 28 points\n\nCorey Anderson was a splashy overseas signing from the New Zealand national team for the Mustangs. His wife is American, and his place in the Black Caps had been slipping regularly to younger players, so he decided to make the move to Texas. He struggled for the most part, except for a bludgeoning 108 not out against the second-tier Chicago Catchers. Irving muddled through the season struggling for runs and wickets against the better opponents and winning enough against the lesser teams to almost break even. Neither Anderson (311 runs) nor top wicket-taker Ali Sheikh (15) finished in any of the top 20 impact rankings. Irving didn’t play many home games in the DFW area and are likely searching for better digs next season.\n\nChicago Blasters – home ground: BPL Cricket Stadium, Bolingbrook, IL\n\n5th place; 4-9-2 no result; 20 points\n\nThe Blasters were the more successful of the two Chicago franchises, and given the results of both, there may be some consolidation in order. The Blasters split their first two with St. Louis and then finished a disastrous Texas trip at 1-4. The managed to get back to 3-4 with an upset of Austin, one of only two Athletics regular season losses, but then collapsed to 1-5 down the stretch, beating only their sad-sack crosstown rivals. Najam Iqbal placed 12th in bowling impact and Shabheer Hasan led the batters with 311 runs.\n\nSt. Louis Americans – home ground: ACAC Park, Wentzville, MO\n\n6th place; 4-10-1 no result; 18 points\n\nSt. Louis split their first two games and beat Irving to get to 2-1, and then lost seven straight before gaining a split with Houston over the 8/28-8/29 weekend. They were basically out of contention at that point. They beat the Catchers twice on the final weekend to reach four wins. St. Louis was another team where no player registered on the bowling, batting, or overall impact rankings. Jacobus Pienaar from South Africa had 444 runs and Sidarth Trivedi had 17 wickets.\n\nChicago Catchers – home ground: Washington Park/Skokie Sports Complex, Chicago, IL\n\n5th place; 0-13-2 no result; 4 points\n\nIt was a lost season for the other Chicago team. I can’t see them coming back in the same form next season, but you never know. The Catchers came closest to a win against the Blasters on September 11th, losing in the 20th over. They also scored their season high 165 against eventual division champs Austin on August 28th but lost with two overs left. Ranadeep Aleti had 10 wickets to lead the club and Shreyas Ramesh had 266 runs.\n\nPacific Conference, Western Division\n\nGolden State Grizzlies – home ground: Arroyo Park, Davis, CA\n\n1st place; 12-2-1 no result; 50 points\n\nThe Grizzlies were dominant throughout and were the last undefeated team before falling to Silicon Valley on August 28th. They lost to Silicon Valley again on the final weekend, which knocked East Bay out of the playoffs. East Bay wasn’t angry enough to win the final game, leaving Golden State with only those two losses. The number one impact player in the league this year was the Grizzlies’ Hammad Azam. Azam as captain batted himself down in the order but still scored 367 runs, and took 9 wickets as a bowler, yielding a stingy 209 runs in 40 overs for an almost unheard-of economy rate in T20 cricket of slightly over five runs/over. Former USA U19 player Vatsal Vaghela took an amazing 29 wickets.\n\nSilicon Valley Strikers – home ground: Morgan Hill Outdoor Sports Complex, Morgan Hill, CA\n\n2nd place; 11-3-1 no result; 46 points\n\nThe Strikers really had two seasons: one before former India U19 2012 World Cup champion captain Unmukt Chand left India to play for Minor League Cricket and one after. In the first two weekends, they beat Seattle in the 20th over only needing 110 to win, survived a scare from Hollywood by one run, and lost to SoCal with seven balls remaining. None of those teams made the playoffs, and the Strikers appeared destined for the same fate. Then Chand appeared at the top of their order, on August 14th (he got out without scoring that game) and they lost only two games the rest of the regular season. Chand didn’t appear in the impact ratings because of missing three early games, but his impact was enormous, especially as the playoffs neared. He led all batters with 591 runs (including the playoffs). The Strikers beat both their nearest rivals for 2nd place, East Bay, and the division champs Golden State on the last weekend to earn their playoff spot. USA team captain Saurabh Netravalkar, who missed games while on USA duty late in the season, was the bowling star for the Strikers with 12 wickets.\n\nEast Bay Blazers – home ground: Santa Clara Cricket Club, Santa Clara, CA\n\n3rd place; 9-5-1 no result; 38 points\n\nEast Bay started 3-0 against the bottom half of the division, but then lost a tough game to Silicon Valley before bouncing back with four more straight wins to get to 7-1. They were 9-2 heading to a showdown with Golden State, which ended in an agonizing loss in the 19th over when they couldn’t defend 146. They still had an excellent shot at the playoffs in the final weekend but lost a season-defining game to the Strikers by 13 runs and then suffered a 20th over defeat to Golden State when they needed a miracle to make the postseason. Sujith Gowda was a standout with both bat and ball for East Bay and Rusty Theron took 15 wickets.\n\nSeattle Thunderbolts – home ground: Khalanie Park, Issaquah, WA\n\n4th place; 7-7-1 no result; 30 points\n\nThe Great Northwest’s entry played on what appeared to be one of the worst grounds in the league. It looked on camera like an expanse of bare dirt, although I’m sure it was better in person. Nonetheless, they were able to break even against some talented West coast teams. The ‘Bolts had a 5-game winning streak after starting 0-4, and then finished 2-3 with a last-weekend win over a full-strength Silicon Valley that showed their potential. South African quick bowler Shadley Van Schalwyk had 79 not out in that victory. Van Schalwyk (11th overall) and Andries Gous (9th overall) were the top impact players for Seattle for the season.\n\nSan Diego Surf Riders – home ground: Canyonside Park, San Diego, CA\n\n5th place; 4-11-1 no result; 16 points\n\nThe team with the great name had a rough year. They beat fellow second-division team Hollywood to open, but then lost a game they had in hand with three overs to play when USA player Elmore Hutchinson went bananas for SoCal and hit three straight sixes on the last three balls, immediately after two wides, to beat them. After a win against Seattle, they went on an 8-game losing streak that put them out of contention. On the plus side, Canyonside Park is a very nice ground and they had one of the best lead commentators, Jimmy Anklesaria, a local entrepreneurial celebrity in San Diego.\n\nSoCal Lashings – home ground: Woodley Park, Van Nuys, CA\n\n3rd place; 4-11-0 no result; 16 points\n\nSomeday I’ll figure out what a “lashing” is. These Lashings didn’t have much success, but they played on what may be one of the Olympic venues in Los Angeles in 2028, if cricket is voted into that games. Hutchinson led them to that opening win down south, and they won a low-scoring game against the Chand-less Strikers the following weekend. They then embarked on a dispiriting 9-game slide after that, finally beating San Diego again at Woodley Park on September 12th. Harpreet Singh was the top impact player, with the 3rd best bowling figures in the league.\n\nHollywood Master Blasters – home ground: Woodley Park, Van Nuys, CA\n\n3rd place; 2-13-0 no result; 8 points\n\nCo-tenants at Woodley Park with SoCal, Hollywood opened the season 0-5 before surprising Silicon Valley with a 19th over win chasing 147. They didn’t win again until September 18th against their groundsmates, the Lashings. They suffered a 124-run blowout against East Bay, a 9-wicket loss to Seattle, a 7-wicket defeat to Houston, and a 59-run drubbing by SoCal in their final game. Silicon Valley was the one team they could handle, winning that first game and losing by one run in the return encounter. Cody Chetty had 470 runs to finish 10th overall in the league in that department and Khalid Zadran had 13 wickets.\n\nPLAYOFFS\n\nIn a rare move for cricket, but common for most every other US sport, Minor League Cricket elected for a best-of-three series in the quarterfinals. This was followed by a conventional (for cricket) one-game knockout round in the semifinals and final in the showplace ground of Church Street Park in Morrisville, NC.\n\nNew Jersey Stallions vs. Morrisville Cardinals, Morrisville, NC\n\nThis series was played in Morrisville to take advantage of their superior real turf pitch and the fact that the semifinals and finals would be played there. Morrisville ran out of gas when Malhotra left to play in Oman for the USA team, and he didn’t do much for them after his long trip home. New Jersey easily chased 103 (Morrisville lost their 10th wicket on the last ball in their innings) with 16 balls remaining in the opener and then New Jersey put up 183 in the 2nd game, a total Morrisville had nowhere near enough firepower to catch and they fell 41 runs short. The 17-year-old Mukkamala led the scoring for New Jersey with 28 in game 1 and Rovman Powell had 61 off 37 deliveries in game 2 for the Stallions.\n\nEmpire State Titans vs. Atlanta Fire, Cumming, GA\n\nThe Fire were not favored, despite hosting the series, and Empire State took game 1 behind a 25-ball 50 from Bhaskar Yadram and some clutch death bowling by Barnwell to get the rampaging Hanchard Hamilton (55 off 33 at that point) out in the 19th over and by Yadram to limit the Fire to only three runs off the first four balls of the 20th over when they needed 11 to win. The Fire came up one short when their attempt at a desperation three on the final ball was thwarted. Atlanta bounced back in game 2, chasing down a huge 209 total from Empire State with a ball to go. Barnwell’s 82 off 40 was not enough as Taylor and Sagar Patel opened with 80 and 73 before Shamar Springer got them over the line with a walk-off four. Game 3 was all Empire State. They limited Atlanta to 147, getting Taylor for no runs and Patel for only 8. Dry’s 28 not out cameo was helpful, but Empire State finished the chase with Barwell and Griffith at the crease in the 17th over.\n\nAustin Athletics vs. Silicon Valley Strikers, Pearland, TX\n\nSilicon Valley, surging behind the golden bat of Chand, came into this series as a slight favorite despite having to travel. Shehan Jarasuriya, another stalwart all season for the Strikers, led the scoring in game 1 with 78 off 51, and the Athletics’ chase was stymied by the huge wicket of Hamza Bangash (Ali Bangash’s brother) in the 19th over when he was at 67 for 50 balls. Austin fell eight runs short with Bangash in the shed. In game 2, Austin limited Chand to one run, and even with Pranay Suri’s 77 off 49, they were able to keep the total to a reasonable 155. The chase was clinical, with opener William Perkins sticking around into the 9th over for 53, and Jahmar Hamilton anchoring the effort with 41 off 30 to get Austin the victory. Game 3 was the Chand Show, though. The Strikers captain wouldn’t be denied, leading the way with an incredible knock of 132 not out in 69 balls as Silicon Valley won the game and the series with three balls remaining to eclipse the Athletics’ healthy 184 total in the first innings. This was the signature innings of the tournament for Chand and showed exactly why Minor League Cricket was happy to see him come to the US. Amazingly, Bangash repeated the dubious feat his brother Ali performed in the opening game of the regular season against Houston, bowling a no-ball in the 20th over, which certainly didn’t help Austin’s chances.\n\nGolden State Grizzlies vs. Houston Hurricanes, Davis, CA\n\nGolden State completely outclassed Houston in this one, winning both games easily. Sami Aslam, a big signing from Pakistan for Golden State (he played against Chand as the U19 captain for Pakistan in the 2012 World Cup), led all scorers with 65 off 58. Houston’s chase effectively ended when Ludick was sent packing at 59 off 33 in the 14th over. Khan, back from the CPL, chipped in 19 not out off 12 deliveries, but Houston came up 11 runs short. The second game was not as close. Houston only managed 136/9 thanks to a 4-wicket haul from Abheyender Singh. The Grizzlies had few problems in the chase which was led by Zia Muhammad Shahzad’s 74 not out. Khan took the only wicket for Houston in the first over, bowling Karan Chandel.\n\nSemifinal 1: Empire State Titans vs. New Jersey Stallions, Morrisville, NC – October 2nd\n\nNew Jersey beat Empire State both times in the regular season and got off to a great start in this game, taking all 10 Titans wickets and keeping the total to a low 125. Ramrattan was caught behind in the second over of the chase without scoring, but Rihki, back from USA duty, and Barnwell took up the slack to get New Jersey in position. Jon Ross Campbell, the big man from Jamaica, finished the game with a timely 32 not out off 20 to send the Stallions to the finals.\n\nSemifinal 2: Silicon Valley Strikers vs. Golden State Grizzlies, Morrisville NC – October 2nd\n\nSilicon Valley won both games in the regular season as well, and Chand and his fellow opener Rahul Jariwala contributed 59 and 45 not out respectively to post a 168 total. Golden State lost the dreaded three wickets in the power play, and as often plays out, the middle and bottom order were not strong enough to reach the target. Abishek Paradkar and Kulvinder Singh were especially tough on the Grizzlies batting lineup, each taking two wickets, with Singh giving up a scant 19 runs in his four overs. The Strikers won by 33 runs and advanced to Sunday’s showdown with New Jersey.\n\nFinal: Silicon Valley Strikers vs. New Jersey Stallions, Morrisville, NC – October 3rd\n\nNetravalkar, returned from Oman, and Singh upped their bowling game in the final. Singh had the ball moving in the air and took three Stallions wickets, and Netravalkar only allowed 17 runs off four overs with two wickets of his own. Rikhi and Mukkamala each had a good run for New Jersey but could never really accelerate, with Mukkamala falling to Singh on a vicious in-swinger in the 12th over and Rikhi going down in the next over against Netravalkar. Wiig had a nice cameo of 17 off 9 to get the total to 141, but everyone knew that with Chand padding up to open the batting, this would be a difficult number to defend. Chand, Jariwala, and Jayasuriya were all dismissed during the power play, giving New Jersey some hope, but Silicon Valley’s deep batting lineup stepped up. Narsingh Deonarine, a 38-year-old veteran from Guyana, took over the scoring and along with another West Indies mainstay, Roshon Primus, they finished the game with 11 balls to spare. Deonarine’s relatively careful and surehanded 52 off 43 and Primus’ equally circumspect 31 off 25 was all that was needed for the low target of 142. Silicon Valley took home the inaugural title as Deonarine took Player of the Match honors. Chand hung around and signed autographs and spoke at length to about 15 or so local youth players after the game. It was a great scene for Minor League Cricket, which is based in the Silicon Valley area, to see one of their flagship franchises take the trophy at one of their best grounds.\n\nLeague MVP honors went to Hammad Azam, captain of the Golden State Grizzlies and leading overall impact player. Eastern Division MVP was Christopher Barnwell from New Jersey. Southern Division MVP was Corne Dry from Atlanta Fire. Ryan Scott of Michigan won MVP honors from the Central, and of course Azam won MVP in the Western Division as well."

        "title": "Minor League Cricket review part 2: Team Mat",
        "date": "Mon Dec  7 11:06:08 2020",
        "body": "This year’s Minor League Cricket was an exhibition of the depth of skill and talent amongst American and expat players living in the USA.\n\nMost cricket hotspots throughout the country owe their existence to passionate go-getters seeking to enjoy the pastime of their country of origin. As clubs grow to become leagues, public parks and municipal fields install artificial wickets to accommodate demand. Youth cricketers grow up playing on astroturf and mat wickets on mostly undersized, multi-use grounds with lumpy, thick outfields. This, by and large, encapsulates ‘American conditions’.\n\nAs ACE, USAC and entrepreneurs with deep pockets add turf wickets across the country, the quality of cricket will improve. In the meantime, cricket leagues around the country add players by the hundreds, and so artificial surfaces will remain the backbone of American cricket for the foreseeable future. This appears true for Minor League Cricket, at least for the next couple of seasons, as franchise owners are obligated to secure turf within the next ‘two-to-three years.’\n\nUSA Cricket intends to use MiLC as the standard for national T20 team selection. With 59% of the recent exhibition season having been played on mat or astroturf, clearly USAC will have to factor both turf and artificial surfaces into player analysis.\n\nTeam Mat\n\nAs discussed in Team Turf, some regions of the exhibition season played more games on artificial surfaces than others. Teams in the Eastern and MidWest regions played all of their games on artificial wickets, while Georgia and Texas regions played games on turf and artificial. None of the California teams played any games on artificial surfaces. Teams within divisions often didn’t play the same number of games. Obviously this should mean that teams in the Eastern and MidWest regions had a better chance of selection in Team Mat than any of the others. Likewise, we won’t see any players from California honoured.\n\nStatistically speaking, it’s impressive how close three of these divisions were in terms of first innings scores. Of divisions with games on artificial wickets, the Eastern Division found runs marginally more difficult to come by in the first innings (9.12 runs/over in first innings), followed by the Chicago region (9.15 runs/over in first innings), then Texas (9.17 runs/over in the first innings), with Georgia scoring nearly a full run per over faster than the rest (10.06 runs/over in the first innings). This has been factored into my team selection.\n\nOpening Batters –\n\nDarpan Patel, Atlanta Param Veers – 335 runs from 138 balls across four innings on mat! The 36 year old all rounder was the MVP of the South, finished with two centuries, averaged 83.75 on artificial surfaces, and took seven wickets with the ball across 17 overs. Darpan had not yet played on turf when he failed to score at Church Street Park, but his dominance on the mat in Atlanta was undeniable. If you take away Darpan’s three first innings scores on mat, the first innings RPO (runs per over) for the whole division drops more than a half run from 10.06 to 9.54.\n\nRameez Raja, Houston Hurricanes – After Darpan, Rameez was the only batter in MiLC to record two centuries. Rameez is also the only batter to score a century both on turf and artificial surfaces, and narrowly missed out on Team Turf inclusion. Famous name, famous family, but it’s Raja’s 243 runs from 136 balls in four innings at an average of 122.5 which earned him his place in Team Mat, as well as the Central MVP.\n\nHonourable Mentions – Openers absolutely dominated on artificial surfaces, and many deserve mention. NJ Stallion’s Dominique Rikhi scored 211 across four innings at an average of 70.33 and earned the Best Batter award in the Eastern division. Rishi Bhardwaj scored 287 at a strike rate of 156.83 for Atlanta Fire, with three fifties across five innings, earning him Best Batter for the South. Jaskaran Malhotra scored 169 from 114 in three innings on Atlanta mats with three stumpings and two run outs before transforming from super keeper into an all rounder worthy of Team Turf. Chanderpaul Hemraj scored 152 in six innings opening for NJ Somerset Cavaliers, including 6 sixes in one over to help the Cavs beat The Philadelphians on October 4th. His bowling was superb to boot (6.53 ER). Rayyankhan Pathan didn’t waste the power play for Irving, scoring a blistering 134 from 77 balls across four astroturf innings.\n\nTop and Middle Order Batters –\n\nShaheer Hasan, Chicago Blasters – Shaheer Hasan scored 154 at a strike rate of 167.39 for an average of 51.33 for the Chicago Blasters on astroturf, and won the Central MVP. Starting the season as the Blasters’ number three, Shaheer was moved to an opening role. His 101 in an opening partnership with Fahad Babar helped the Blasters to a ten wicket win over the Michigan Cricket Stars in 16.3 overs on September 27.\n\nAaron Jones, New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers – 80 runs from 65 balls after the first three games was a below league average start, but USA Cricket’s top accumulator turned it around in games four and five to sail into the Eastern division runs lead, ending with 286. Jones scored 99 from 55 and 105 from 48 balls in his fourth and fifth innings in an October 3 double header against Empire State Titans to blast NJSC into first place for good.\n\nKaran Kumar, Chicago Catchers – The Catchers captain had one excellent innings in his three games, but it was huge. His 113 from 50 not out put the game just out of reach for the chasing rival Chicago Blasters in the final game of the exhibition season for both teams. Kumar’s massive strike rate of 201.37 and average of 73.5 meant that the rest of his team needed to score at only 131.61 to equal par. Kumar also contributed two wickets in six middle overs of off-break bowling.\n\nGarth Garvey, Atlanta Param Veers – Darpan Patel might have set the table for APV, but Garth Garvey cleaned it up. Regularly providing a big boost while finishing for the Param Veers, the Jamaican first-class cricketer scored 182 at at a strike rate of 195.7 in four furious innings on mat to help APV to a 3-1 record in Georgia. Garvey did not bowl on artificial wickets, but took one wicket in four overs at an economy rate of 6.0 on turf.\n\nHonourable Mentions – Former USA smasher Syed Abdullah scored 198 at a strike rate of 157.14 in six innings batting third for the table toppers in the Eastern division. Jaladh Dua scored 187 at a strike rate of 123.84 in three innings for Empire State Titans. Waseem Shahzehd blasted 99 runs in a hurry for Empire State, striking at 198 and averaging 33.\n\nAll Rounders –\n\nAdil Bhatti, DC Hawks – DC had their exhibition season cut short to only two games, due to a positive Covid-19 case, but two games were enough for the former USA all-rounder to make his mark. Bhatti scored 63 from 37 and 57 from 33, and took two powerplay wickets in his five overs at an economy rate of 7.4 to keep DC undefeated.\n\nKarima Gore, The Philadelphians – USA’s left arm orthodox all-rounder showed why he went first in the MiLC draft. Gore was typically economical with the ball, finishing with an economy rate of 5.08 in three innings. At the end, it was Gore’s elite fielding and clutch play which sealed his place in this team and, more importantly, The Philadelphians first win. Against New England Eagles on October 4, Gore scored 30 runs not out in the first innings while his team set a target of 140 for NEE, only eight runs more than the Cavaliers had scored against Philly in NJSC’s win earlier that same day. This time, the game belonged to Gore. With four overs for only 12 runs, Gore built pressure and deflated the chase with two runouts, including one on the final ball of the game to seal the one run win.\n\nHonourable Mentions – Assad Fudadin scored 189 across four accumulating innings as MVP in the Eastern division, including an 80-run Man of the Match performance against Empire State Titans, and took five wickets at an economy rate of 6.88 in his 16 overs. Shaker Ahmed scored 144 at a strike rate of 130.91 in four innings for Michigan Cricket Stars and took two wickets at an economy rate of 6.86 in 14 overs with the ball. DC’s Navin Stewart took six wickets at an average of 11.67 and scored 61 lightning fast runs at a strike rate of 254.17 in his two innings, narrowly missing out. Atlanta Fire’s Sahil Charania took seven wickets and scored 119 runs at a strike rate of 208.77 in five games. Shawn Findlay took three wickets in 12 overs at an economy rate of 8.08 for NJSC, but his 129 runs at a strike rate of 184.29 stood taller. Amadullah Adil bowled eight overs at an economy rate of 8.88 with five wickets and scored 47 quick runs at a hyperreal strike rate of 261.11 for Chicago Blasters.\n\nBowlers –\n\nBruce Blackwood, New England Eagles – The Eastern division’s leading wicket taker, Blackwood did it with an economy well under par, at 6.89. In his five games and 19 overs, Blackwood took ten scalps, five in the death. Leading a deep division in wickets while maintaining such a low economy for a team finishing last is an accomplishment worth recognising.\n\nNosthush Kenjige, Irving Mustangs – The only player to make both Team Turf and Team Mat, Nosh forced his way in, earning Central’s Best Bowler in the process. In spite of playing just four games on Astroturf, Nosh led all bowlers on artificial surfaces in wickets, with figures of 15 overs, 111 runs, and eleven wickets. His incredible performance on September 27 against Austin Athletics, in which he factored into seven of Austin’s wickets either in the field (four catches), with the ball (four wickets), or both (one caught and bowled) earned the Mustangs a key win.\n\nJessy Singh, New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers – While Blackwood dominated the death, Jessy dominated the powerplay. The veteran USA quick totalled more wickets in the powerplay (six) than any bowler on artificial surfaces. Jessy’s economy rate of 7.10 put him well under the division mean, and his five wicket haul flattening a potent New Jersey Stallions top order was one of only three in MiLC on artificial wickets.\n\nHonourable Mentions – Versatile Hunain Amin took nine wickets in four games (four in the powerplay, four in the death) for Chicago Blasters, and did it at an economy rate of 6.75. Sikhander Soleja took nine wickets in 13.4 overs for Chicago Catchers, with five wickets coming in the death. Morrisville’s teenage star Rohan Phadke earned Best Bowler award for the South, and took eight wickets in eight overs on mat, including a five wicket haul against Atlanta Fire on September 20. Gavon Brown took five death wickets in four games for NJ Stallions, and three more in the powerplay, going for a tidy economy rate of 7.05. Manoj Acharya played a crucial role for Philly, taking six wickets in ten overs at an economy rate of 6.30. Junaid Khan took six wickets in four games on Astro for Irving, four in the death and two in the powerplay. Juanoy Drysdale’s minuscule economy rate of 4.92 from 12 overs helped Jessy Singh, Hemraj, and Muhammad Ghous (economy rate of 6.88 in 17 overs) fortify NJSC’s bowling attack.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, there will come a time when all of these cricketers will get their chance to be measured on turf. Even then, the vastness and varied climates of the United States will create unique conditions in every corner. This variety should surely be a strength in the development of American cricket. Hope and opportunity will build as more turf wickets develop, and hope and opportunity will be the theme of Part Three of this MiLC review: Team U21.\n\nTeam Mat:\n\nDarpan Patel, Atlanta Param Veers\n\nRameez Raja, Houston Hurricanes\n\nShaheer Hasan, Chicago Blasters\n\nAaron Jones, New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers\n\nKaran Kumar, Chicago Catchers\n\nGarth Garvey, Atlanta Param Veers\n\nAdil Bhatti, DC Hawks\n\nKarima Gore, The Philadelphians\n\nBruce Blackwood, New England Eagles\n\nNosthush Kenjige, Irving Mustangs\n\nJessy Singh, New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers\n\nNext up: Team U21",
        "summary": "The article discusses the Minor League Cricket (MiLC) tournament, which was an exhibition of skill and talent among American and expat players living in the USA. The tournament was played on artificial surfaces, with most games taking place on astroturf or mat wickets. The quality of cricket is expected to improve as more turf wickets are installed across the country.\n\nThe article highlights the performance of players in different regions, with some regions playing more games on artificial surfaces than others. The Eastern and MidWest regions played all their games on artificial wickets, while California teams did not play any games on artificial surfaces.\n\nThe article also selects a \"Team Mat\" comprising the top performers on artificial surfaces. The team includes:\n\n* Openers: Darpan Patel, Rameez Raja\n* Top and Middle Order Batters: Shaheer Hasan, Aaron Jones, Karan Kumar, Garth Garvey\n* All-Rounders: Adil Bhatti, Karima Gore\n* Bowlers: Bruce Blackwood, Nosthush Kenjige, Jessy Singh\n\nThe article also mentions several honorable mentions, including players who performed well but did not make the Team Mat. The next part of the review will focus on Team U21."

        "title": "The Road to Minor League Cricket – Sujith Gowda – Minor League Cricket News",
        "date": "Fri Nov 19 00:00:00 2021",
        "body": "You know what college your favorite running back played for and you even know what high school the top NBA and MLB players went to, but what do you know about the best cricketers in this country? How did they get to the top of their game? We continue our look at the different paths players took to make it to Minor League Cricket with part three in this series (read part one and part two). This time, Steve Steinberg of CricAmerica sat down with one of the more dominating batsmen of the past season for an in-depth chat…\n\nSujith Gowda (East Bay Blazers)\n\nAlmost 9,000 miles from where his cricketing adventures began, the East Bay Blazers’ Sujith Gowda made his presence felt in the premier season of Minor League Cricket. He led the league in runs during the regular season with 481 and was a boundary machine — placing among the leaders in both fours and sixes. Given his cricketing background and his intense dedication to the game, though, it was hardly surprising.\n\n“I started playing cricket when I was in third grade,” says the 25-year-old. And from the very beginning, he was very committed to improving his game. “From about fifth or sixth grade, the practice routine started very early in the morning — five o’clock in the morning — and then I’d go to school and then after school I’d go back to practice again. My time was very dedicated to cricket — mornings and evenings, every day without fail. It was probably around two-and-a-half or three hours in the morning and another three hours in the evening. And when I got to about 15 or 16 years old, that’s when I began doing my one-on-one training to work on specific skills.”\n\nAnd all those hours of work paid off. “I played through middle school and high school and then I started playing for the state team. From there I went on to play club cricket against all the pros and I started leading the Under-19 state team and the Under-23 state team. I played for the state team — Karnataka — for the past 7 years and when I finished playing Under-23, I came to the US.”\n\nSujith’s home in the states has been Dallas. And the Dallas area had more than just the promise of cricket to lure him here in August 2020. “One of the reasons I came was to get my master’s. I’m getting my master’s in engineering management from University of Texas at Arlington in December.” (So, just like you know that Tom Brady went to Michigan and Steph Curry went to Davidson, you now know that Sujith Gowda went to UTA!)\n\n“Once I landed here, a lot of club cricketers reached out to me. I started playing some club games and then from there started playing a lot of tournaments. People started seeing me and then things got easier.” And, from the beginning, he was impressed by the level of the cricket he saw. “I didn’t know there would be so much good cricket happening here. At first, I thought there would be some amateur cricketers playing here but then I happened to see a lot of leagues and a lot of academies for cricket and realized it’s not just going to be amateurs here — there’ll be some good competition going on.”\n\nSuccess in the Dallas area led to his being selected for Minor League Cricket. “We had a camp in Houston for all the MLC players. I think it was in January or February. That’s when all these players started seeing me. The various owners knew me well, because they’d seen me play and I’d been in touch with them since I moved to the US, so I got a call asking if I wanted to play for the Blazers.”\n\nAnd the competition level and structure of Minor League Cricket has won him over. “I would rate the standards of Minor League Cricket and a few of the open tournaments I’ve played in to be the same, but the minor league was much more organized. It’s on a more professional level. It has value for players with respect to the training room and the gap between games. And it’s organized really well.”\n\nBased on his experiences with high level cricket in India and what he’s seen so far in the US, Sujith is very optimistic about the future of the game here. “The main reason why I think cricket in the US will have a very good future is the level of cricket already being played here, the number of academies, and the under-19 game. It’s not just pros coming from outside and just playing and going away. It’s a structure to improve the grassroots level of cricket in the country.”\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of cricketers here in Dallas who are extremely good. The only thing they didn’t have was match exposure and the situation exposure, which they’re getting now with so many games being played. Talent is there. Skill is there. And they’re improving very fast.”\n\nHe’s even more optimistic about the next generation of American players. “People are looking forward to playing Minor League Cricket. I can see the kids here when I meet them. They want to play Minor League and now they have something to look forward to. The standards and the bar are set very high right now and everyone’s trying to push the bar higher.”\n\nAnd where does he see himself fitting into the future of cricket here? “I can see a lot of cricket for me for at least the next ten or fifteen years. I have ten or fifteen years of cricket left in me in this country — whether it’s minor league, major league, or — hopefully, soon — the national team.”\n\nWho would Sujith want to play with on his Dream XI? “AB de Villiers, Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah. If I had to, I could name a lot of people! The game’s united a lot of different cultures and ethnicities, but that’s the beauty of this game.”",
        "summary": "* Sujith Gowda, a 25-year-old batsman, led the league in runs during the regular season with 481 and was a boundary machine in the premier season of Minor League Cricket.\n* Gowda started playing cricket at a young age and was dedicated to improving his game, practicing for 5-6 hours every day from the age of 10.\n* He played for the state team in Karnataka, India for 7 years and then moved to the US to pursue a master's degree in engineering management at the University of Texas at Arlington.\n* In the US, Gowda played club cricket and tournaments, impressing scouts and eventually getting selected for Minor League Cricket.\n* He was impressed by the level of cricket in the US and appreciated the organization and structure of Minor League Cricket.\n* Gowda is optimistic about the future of cricket in the US, citing the existing level of cricket, academies, and under-19 games as reasons for his optimism.\n* He believes that American players have the talent and skill, but need more match exposure and experience.\n* Gowda sees himself playing cricket in the US for the next 10-15 years, potentially even representing the national team."

        "title": "2023 MINOR LEAGUE CRICKET SEASON TO BE PLAYED EXCLUSIVELY ON NATURAL TURF AND H3 HYBRID WICKETS – Minor League Cricket News",
        "date": "Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 2022",
        "body": "Minor League Cricket is delighted to announce that all matches in the 2023 season will take place on a natural turf or hybrid playing surface for the first time, with no artificial or matting wickets to be used.\n\nThe announcement marks a milestone in the rapid development of Minor League Cricket, with the number of matches expected to be played on natural turf and hybrid wickets in 2023 set to increase by over sixty per cent from the 2022 season, which featured nearly 200 matches. The nation’s leading domestic T20 championship saw its second season won by the Seattle Thunderbolts, claiming a $150,000 first place prize by defeating the Atlanta Fire in the final held in August.\n\nThe growing number of natural turf and hybrid wickets installed across the United States is a result of the commitment MiLC team owners have made to developing high-quality cricketing facilities in their regions. These facilities will also be available for use not only during the MiLC tournament, but for wider use by the cricket community throughout the year.\n\n“Preparing players to perform at the highest level possible is the goal of Minor League Cricket and playing on natural or hybrid playing surfaces is a key part of that equation. It’s a huge sign of the commitment made by MiLC team owners to the sport’s development that all matches in the 2023 season will take place on natural turf or hybrid wickets, providing a significant boost for the quality of play in American cricket,” said Zubin Surkari, League Operations Manager, Minor League Cricket.\n\nMajor League Cricket’s partnership with Gabba Sporting Products, one of Australia’s leading sporting product manufacturers, has brought the H3 Hybrid Cricket Pitch to American shores, fast-tracking the installation of high-quality cricket playing surfaces nationwide. Twenty-two hybrid pitches are set to be installed across the United States by the start of the 2023 domestic cricket season.\n\nThe H3 Hybrid Cricket Pitch is made from a high-quality synthetic grass which is filled with natural soil, combining the individual qualities of a natural and synthetic pitch. The result is a low maintenance surface that is easy to prepare and provides the bounce, seam and spin of a natural turf pitch. Hybrid pitches are now in-use at the international level of the game, with the International Cricket Council (ICC) recently approving use of the surfaces in Men’s and Women’s ODI and T20I matches.\n\nFive hybrid pitches have already been installed across the United States in 2022, with the most recent installations being completed at ACAC Park in St. Louis and South Elgin Sporting Fields in Chicago, primarily intended for use by youth cricketers. This innovative cricketing infrastructure will provide players at all levels with the ability to play on durable surfaces that closely replicate natural turf wickets, at a fraction of the cost and maintenance required by a natural turf pitch.",
        "summary": "* The 2023 season of Minor League Cricket (MiLC) will feature all matches played on natural turf or hybrid playing surfaces, with no artificial or matting wickets.\n* This marks a significant increase of over 60% from the 2022 season, which had nearly 200 matches.\n* The Seattle Thunderbolts won the 2022 MiLC championship, earning a $150,000 first-place prize by defeating the Atlanta Fire in the final.\n* The growth of natural turf and hybrid wickets in the US is attributed to the commitment of MiLC team owners to develop high-quality cricketing facilities, which will be available for use by the cricket community throughout the year.\n* The use of hybrid pitches, such as the H3 Hybrid Cricket Pitch, provides a low-maintenance surface that closely replicates natural turf wickets.\n* Twenty-two hybrid pitches are set to be installed across the US by the start of the 2023 domestic cricket season, in addition to the five already installed in 2022."
