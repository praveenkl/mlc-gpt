Despite an initial investment of $120M, the league's co-founder Vijay Srinivasan is confident that the league will break even and become profitable within a three-to-five-year horizon. The league has received significant interest from the South Asian diaspora in Texas, with a large Indian American population in the Dallas area. The league has also attracted top international players with competitive salaries. While the league has seen commercial success in its first season, with over two-thirds of matches sold out and CBS broadcasting some games, the long-term success of the game in the US depends on building a pipeline of young American players.

The inaugural season featured six teams and 19 games, including four playoff games, and saw a competitive series with sell-out crowds.\n\n**Star Power**\nThe league attracted international stars like Jason Roy, Liam Plunkett, Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, and Kagiso Rabada, which contributed to its competitive nature and appeal to American audiences.\n\n**Sustainability**\nThe sustainability of MLC is a concern, as it competes with an already packed cricket schedule. The league's ability to attract top-tier English talent, who are often busy with international commitments, is a challenge. Additionally, the league needs to navigate its place in the cricketing calendar to avoid conflicts with other major competitions.\n\n**Contracts and Player Availability**\nMLC's affiliation with IPL franchises could work in its favor, as players like Jofra Archer, who have been offered lucrative contracts, may choose to play for their IPL teams over representing their national teams. This could lead to a shift in the way players prioritize their commitments.\n\n**Future Outlook**\nThe future of MLC depends on its ability to sustain interest and appeal to American audiences beyond the initial novelty. The league needs to address its place in the cricketing calendar, avoid conflicts with other competitions, and navigate the complexities of player contracts and availability."
