        "body": "Test great Steve Smith is to play for Washington Freedom in the second season of Major League Cricket as the Australian influence in the American T20 competition gathers pace.\n\nThe 34-year-old Smith will link up with another batting great, coach Ricky Ponting, in the capital-based franchise after the T20 World Cup in the US, where he still hopes to represent Australia again.\n\nIt's a signing which was widely expected as Smith was named brand ambassador to Washington Freedom last year, while his state team, NSW, have a high-performance partnership with the club.\n\nIn a video post on X on Thursday, Smith said: \"I'm super excited about joining the Washington Freedom ... I can't wait to meet all of my new teammates and play in front of some incredible crowds in America.\n\n\"I'm also really looking forward to working with Ricky Ponting again and his amazing staff. Can't wait for the season. Come on the Freedom!\"\n\nIn February when he was named Washington coach, Ponting had made it clear he hoped to woo top Australian names into the US adventure, noting: \"With the relationships I've had with some of these guys, hopefully those relationships and the right amount of money is enough to bring them to the Freedom.\n\n\"There's huge potential, huge growth possibilities in the US, even with the IPL ownership model the way it is at the moment, it's got potential to become huge and I want to be a part of that journey along the way.\"\n\nWashington finished third in the inaugural season of the six-team tournament last year, with the follow-up edition beginning on July 4 after the conclusion to the World Cup in the US and Caribbean.\n\nSmith has only played four T20 internationals since the start of 2023, and wasn't picked up in the Indian Premier League auction in December, so he's been short of short-format action.\n\nSmith, who owns an apartment in New York, has talked of the prospect of playing in the US as \"cool\".\n\nTalking of his prospects of making the World Cup squad, he said recently: \"I think they're pretty settled up top - to be honest - with Travis Head, David Warner and Mitchell Marsh in the top three.\n\n\"I'm not really sure what (selectors) want to do. I'm not really too fussed either way. If I'm there, I'm there; if I'm not, I'm not.\"\n\nBut his signing caps an increasingly strong-looking Australian involvement in the tournament.\n\nAdam Zampa and Spencer Johnson will be at the Los Angeles Knight Riders, while Tim David will play for MI New York, the Mumbai Indians'-owned team, with more Australian stars still expected to be snapped up."

        "body": "MLC 2023 Final: Nicholas Pooran put up a superlative effort with the bat to help MI New York clinch the first-ever Major League Cricket title on Sunday.\n\nThe wicketkeeper-batter scored 137 runs off 55 balls as MI New York took down Seattle Orcas by seven wickets at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas. MI New York restricted Seattle Orcas to 183/9 before chasing down their target in just 16 overs.\n\nMI New York didn't get off to the best of starts as Imad Wasim dismissed Steven Taylor in their third delivery of the opening over. However, Pooran made his intentions quite clear for the night when he struck consecutive sixes off Wasim's bowling in the same over. The West Indian showcased tremendous form as he hit Dwaine Pretorius for three sixes and two boundaries in the third over.\n\nOpening batter Shayan Jahangir fell to Wayne Parnell in the fifth over, but Pooran continued to find maximums at the other end. He struck three sixes off Andrew Tye's bowling to take MI New York's score to 80/2 in just 6 overs. Pooran kept finding the middle of his bat and smashed a total of 10 fours and 13 sixes during his innings. The Captain remained unbeaten on 137 runs off 55 balls and single-handedly took MI New York over the line with 4 overs to spare.\n\nEarlier in the day, MI New York won the toss and put Seattle Orcas into bat. Quinton de Kock looked in prime touch as he struck Jessy Singh for consecutive boundaries in the second over. However, Rashid Khan sent De Kock's opening partner Nauman\n\nAnwar packing for 9 runs off 13 balls in the fifth over. Thereafter, Shehan Jayasuriya provided excellent support to De Kock as he hit David Wiese for a four and six in the seventh over. But Steven Taylor bowled him out for 16 runs off 15 balls in the tenth over.\n\nFollowing Heinrich Klaasen's early departure, De Kock and Shubham Ranjane put up a fantastic partnership of 51 runs from 24 balls to take Orcas' score to 142/4 in 16.1 overs. Thereafter, the Orcas kept losing wickets at regular intervals, but Dwaine Pretorius' cameo of 21 runs from 7 balls helped his team post a formidable total on the board.\n\nSpeaking about his team's victory, the leading run-scorer in the tournament and MLC Season 1 MVP Nicholas Pooran said, \"We spoke today about having an opportunity to do something special. I am very proud of everything every individual did and everyone contributed in some way. The people in the dressing room told me that I just needed to bat like Nicky P and not think about batting like the captain. I just backed my skills. The platform was there today and the opportunity was there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Seattle Orcas' Captain Wayne Parnell said, \"Whenever someone plays like that, you have to give them credit. Credit to Nicky and his team. It did not look like he (Pooran) would mishit a ball today. We put up a decent total but we have to give them credit today. The first MLC season has gone really well. Credit to everyone who has organized it. Credit to our owners and the management for picking this team and giving us the freedom to play this brand of cricket.\"\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nMI New York 184/3 (Nicholas Pooran 137*, Dewald Brevis 20, Imad Wasim 1/14) beat Seattle Orcas 183/9 (Quinton de Kock 87, Shubham Ranjane 29, Rashid Khan 3/9) by 7 wickets.\n\nCatch the latest stock market updates here.

        "body": "As he prepares to lead MI New York in the inaugural MLC season, the West Indies legend reflects on the changing attitudes to T20 franchise cricket\n\n1:14\n\nPollard on franchise cricket: 'Now everyone's seeing the light'\n\nIt's been more than a decade since Kieron Pollard was branded a \"mercenary\" for choosing to chance his arm in the emerging T20 franchise market, rather than knuckle down in the West Indies national set-up and allow his future to be determined by the vagaries of form and selectorial whim.\n\nBut now, at the age of 35, as he sits in his hotel-room in Grand Prairie, Texas, awaiting his latest venture in USA's Major League Cricket (MLC), it's safe to say he feels vindicated - by the career he's made for himself on the one hand, but also by the path he's set for others to follow.\n\n\"I just sit back with a smile on my face, knowing that we were 10-15 years ahead of everybody,\" Pollard tells ESPNcricinfo, as he contemplates cricket's shifting sands, and the growing recognition that this generation of franchise-first cricketers are no longer simply seen as renegades by the wider game, but as pioneers in an ever-evolving sport.\n\nRelated\n\nDeandra Dottin warns West Indies to get their house in order\n\nTexas brings the vibe and welcomes franchise cricket to America\n\nCricket's American dream takes flight - 'This season is about proving we can do it'\n\nMLC: Teams, players, format, fixtures, and everything else you need to know\n\nRoy agrees termination of ECB incremental contract to play in MLC\n\n\"I got a lot of stick for it for various reasons, because certain persons couldn't see past their noses,\" he adds, recalling his run-ins with West Indies board members back in the day, not least in 2010, when he turned down a central contract that would have required him to renege on his T20 Blast deal with Somerset.\n\n\"But it is what it is. Hopefully, those persons now, who are speaking about all this as a 'big delight' and 'so amazing', hopefully they remember the words they were using not too long in the past, to describe myself and others who had a choice to make at that particular time.\"\n\nThe rest, you could say, is a history that Pollard is still in the process of writing. And his next chapter will unfold at the as-yet unassuming Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas, when he leads out MI New York against San Francisco Unicorns on Friday night.\n\n\"In this day and age, we're still unearthing new T20 tournaments,\" he adds, and even the man himself might be hard-pressed to recall every team that he's turned out for in the course of his globe-trotting career - one that's taken him from Trinidad to India, to England, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and most places in between … even to Canada for two seasons of the Global T20 League in 2018 and 2019.\n\nMore recently, however, one common theme has tended to underpin Pollard's global exploits. After 13 richly decorated seasons with Mumbai Indians in the IPL, he was in action earlier this year for MI Emirates in the inaugural ILT20 in the UAE. And now here he is, captaining Mumbai's fledgling USA franchise, and providing vital continuity between these as-yet loosely affiliated teams, as the Ambani family continues to push that brand recognition around the globe.\n\n\"That's a relationship and a connection that has been created over more than a decade,\" Pollard says, having played more than 200 matches for Mumbai, and been involved in five IPL and two Champions League T20 titles. \"If you understand the fact that Indian players can't play around the world, I'm the closest thing in terms of connection to build a franchise and to build a brand. So yes, you can say I'm a pioneer in that aspect of it as well.\n\n\"Obviously I've played cricket in America before, but only in Florida. Coming here to the Texan heat is going to be different,\" he adds. \"But I'm pretty excited to see what's there to offer.\n\n\"At some point in time, we're going to have our stadium in New York, and the people of New York will come out to support us. I think it's a great concept. There's plenty room for cricket in America. Obviously we know what American sports dominate the TV headlines, but hopefully, this is the start of something for a long period of time.\"\n\n\"I've seen the speculation about 12-month contracts for Jofra; I don't know anything about that. But at some point in time, it's being touted that this is going to happen. And I can't see it not happening.\"\n\nKieron Pollard\n\nOther familiar names fill out MI New York's overseas slots. Trent Boult now plays for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, but as Player of the Match in Mumbai's most recent title success in 2020, he still holds a large measure of affection from the aficionados. And then there's Australia's Tim David, \"one of the new entertainers of T20 cricket,\" as Pollard himself describes his heir apparent in Mumbai's middle-order, and the man upon whom much of MI New York's publicity in the Big Apple itself was focussed prior to the tournament.\n\nMonth by month, tournament by tournament, therefore, the inevitability grows that 12-month franchise contracts are the next big disruption to the sport as it is currently known. A lot of the speculation in that regard has centred around another of Mumbai's prize assets, Jofra Archer, whose recovery from an ongoing elbow problem has been a co-operative arrangement between the franchise's medical team, and the ECB.\n\n\"I've seen the speculation about 12-month contracts for Jofra; I don't know anything about that,\" Pollard says. \"I don't know if anyone, at this point in time, is actually on [one of those]. But at some point in time, it's being touted that this is going to happen. And I can't see it not happening.\n\n\"It's an ever-changing scenario, but that's what life is about,\" he adds. \"Life is about change, and it's about adapting to change. Long ago, we might not have been able to have this interview, face-to-face on different continents, because of technology. So we need to adapt to change in all facets of life.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can see the benefits of it, and hopefully, the 'board games' - the franchise game and the international game - can mesh together and find that right balance to characterise the importance of certain tournaments and understand that international cricket has its place as well in the calendar with the franchises.\"\n\nThere's little doubt, however, that Pollard is revelling in a satisfying degree of schadenfreude as he watches the same issues that, back in the day, tore the fabric of West Indies cricket now affect even the more powerful boards in the international game.\n\nBack in February, for instance, when several England players - including Alex Hales, Sam Billings and Liam Dawson - opted out of a white-ball tour of Bangladesh to honour their contracts in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), England's managing director, Rob Key, acknowledged that the \"life-changing sums of money\" on offer for \"a few weeks' work\" meant it was increasingly hard to criticise those who were putting club over country. And now, we can add to that number Jason Roy, the only active England player involved in this year's MLC, whose deal with LA Knight Riders required the early termination of his ECB contract.\n\nResponding to Key's quotes back in February, Pollard wrote on Instagram: \"Live to see this day. Eight years ago, different names we called it.\"\n\n\"Some of us were forced in a corner, and we were vilified for it,\" Pollard says. \"But now the pathway is clear. Everyone is seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and I've just seen a lot of people sprint through those doors. I just sit back with a smile on my face, with typical Caribbean flair, maybe watching the blue seas and the sand, and just taking in the movie.\"\n\nOn the face of it, West Indies' standards have continued to plummet in recent years, with their recent failure to qualify for the ODI World Cup marking a new nadir in their fortunes. And yet, as one of the players whose IPL experience was a vital component of their two T20 World Cup titles in three attempts between 2012 and 2016, Pollard remains adamant that he and his team-mates have more than done their bit for the region.\n\n\"We won two World Cups with the West Indies team, and there have been different talents coming out. But we weren't able to capitalise,\" he said.\n\n\"For us in the Caribbean, when we had the opportunity to understand where the game was going, we were stubborn. We had guys saying 'you can't do this' or 'you can't do that'. And then all the legal ramifications came into play, rather than saying, 'this is the future, let's find a way'. If we had done that, things would have been different.\n\n\"What T20 Cricket gives you is an opportunity for longevity in your career,\" he adds. \"What is too much? You don't know. But it's just a matter of balancing it out and understanding that every tournament and every version of cricket has a place on the international calendar.\"\n\nMLC's place in the calendar is yet to be fully determined. This year's taster season is a mere two weeks long, but Pollard is optimistic about the extent to which the tournament can capture local imagination - especially if the USA's hitherto lesser-known players can seize on their moments in the limelight, and help to show the American grassroots game that there's a genuine living to be made from the sport.\n\nMI New York squad includes the current USA captain and wicketkeeper, Monank Patel, who was in recent action at the World Cup qualifier in Zimbabwe, and Steven Taylor, whom Pollard describes as \"as one of the best cricketers going around in America\".\n\n\"This tournament gives them an opportunity to rub shoulders with the quality of players in our squad,\" Pollard adds. \"It will help them grow their game, so that they can become stalwarts of the American game in their own right.\n\n\"They've always had different persons trying to start up [cricket in the USA], but this is an opportunity to set the benchmark, and hopefully the backing of the Indian franchises will give MLC a chance to be futuristic, rather than just a pop-up tournament.\n\n\"Every tournament has its own cultural differences, and the quality can be different too. But what I can safely say, no doubt, the IPL has the right template as the best T20 league in the world. All the others, they won't be able to compete but, with the right persons behind it and the right structures, in whatever country you are, you can have a decent league. Obviously, the IPL is No.1 and everybody else will be second.\"\n\nKieron Pollard is an Investor and Ambassador for Me + U\n\nAndrew Miller is UK editor of ESPNcricinfo. @miller_cricket"

        "body": "The United States of America (USA), a first-world country is taking tiny little steps into the world of cricket, with its first major offering being the Major League Cricket (MLC). Cricket as a sport has remained USA's Achilles Heel and with some of the younger players set to rub shoulders with the best T20 players in the world, the tournament is not only hoping to expand the game beyond traditional territories but also give a platform to the young players, who will be seen with some of the best.\n\nThe 19-game tournament will be played at two venues - Dallas and Morrisville - with a hope to take the game beyond just a couple of centres and ensure that since there are two venues, the demand for tickets will be at an all-time high. The six teams are based in some of the most popular and traditional American cities - Los Angeles, Texas, New York, Washington DC, San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nThree of these teams have been purchased by the teams owning the IPL sides, Chennai Super Kings (Texas), Mumbai Indians (New York) and Kolkata Knight Riders (Los Angeles), while the co-owners of the Delhi Capitals have a stake in Seattle Orcas. The tournament promises to be a cracker since it's short and sweet while it could serve as the curtain-raiser for more games in the US, given there's a T20 World Cup to be hosted next year in June.\n\nWhen and where to watch Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023 in India on TV and streaming?\n\nThe Major League Cricket (MLC) while being an exciting proposition to expand the game beyond usual territories is a noble cause but since it's in America, the viewing will be affected in countries far east like the Indian subcontinent, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania. The day-night matches will begin at 6 AM while the day matches have a 2 AM IST start.\n\nThe inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC) will have a live broadcast through the Sports18 channel on TV while the streaming of all the games will be available on the Jiocinema app and website."

        "date": "Thu May 25 13:12:46 2023",
        "body": "Jason Roy has become the first England player to end his national contract in order to play franchise cricket.\n\nOpener Roy has opted to cancel his incremental England deal - worth £60,000-£70,000 - to play in the American Major League Cricket, where he could earn £150,000 for one season.\n\nThe 32-year-old will still be available for national selection.\n\nRoy said: \"To be very clear, my priority is England cricket, especially with a World Cup soon upon us.\"\n\nWriting on social media, he added: \"It is for me, and for any player, the greatest honour to receive a cap to play for their country.\n\n\"I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will walk away from England.\"\n\nAn England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) statement said: \"Jason Roy has informed the England and Wales Cricket Board that he wishes to take up an agreement with Major League Cricket in the USA later this summer.\n\n\"The ECB have agreed for him to play in the competition on the proviso that he gives up the remainder of his ECB incremental contract, which both parties have agreed to.\n\n\"The ECB wish to clarify that this decision will not affect Jason's selection for England teams going forward. We have absolute confidence and faith that Jason is committed to England cricket.\"\n\nRoy has been a key component of England's dominance of the global white-ball game, a regular in the side that was crowned 50-over world champions in 2019.\n\nHowever, a loss of form saw him dropped from the squad that won the T20 World Cup last year and, in October, he saw his central contract downgraded to an incremental deal.\n\nWith Major League Cricket taking place between the T20 Blast and The Hundred, Roy might have been ordered to rest by England, especially with the defence of the 50-over World Cup on the horizon in India in October and November.\n\nInstead, Roy will end his England deal, forgo the rest of his salary up to its expiry at the end of September.\n\n\"Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer,\" added Roy.\n\n\"I hope to play for England for many more years. That remains my priority.\n\n\"I've had clear and supportive conversations with the ECB about participating in Major League Cricket. The ECB were happy with me to play in the competition as long as they didn't have to pay me for the remainder of the contractual year.\n\n\"As a single-format player with no central contract I wanted to take the opportunity to play this competition as there are currently no scheduling conflicts with England. It benefits me as an England player to play as much competitive cricket as possible.\"\n\nWriting on Twitter former England captain Michael Vaughan wrote: \"I don't get the big issue about Jason Roy. He hasn't got any England games and has been offered a nice contract in the States so he has taken it. It is inevitable that we will see more of this in the future. And I have no problem with it.\"\n\nThough there is some overlap with the Blast, it is understood Roy will remain with his county Surrey if they reach finals day, before returning to play for Oval Invincibles in The Hundred in August.\n\nRoy has played five Tests, 116 one-day internationals and 64 T20s for England, scoring almost 6,000 international runs.\n\nHis decision is the latest in a fast-changing landscape of global cricket, with the money on offer to players in franchise leagues challenging the primacy of international matches.\n\nA number of players chose to skip England's white-ball tour of Bangladesh earlier this year in favour of franchise deals, while there have been reports of franchise owners preparing to offer long contracts to the biggest stars.\n\nEarlier this month, former England all-rounder Ravi Bopara told the Test Match Special podcast: \"It is a real thing to start thinking about for the players.\n\n\"If they are offering long-term contracts, I'm talking three, four or five years, then it is a serious subject to start thinking about as a player.\"\n\nIn response, England are set to revamp their central contract system, with greater flexibility and possibly more money on offer.\n\nSome players could be offered multi-year deals to guard against the attraction of franchise leagues.\n\nWhite-ball specialists could be offered small retainer contracts but increased match fees, to make England tours more financially attractive than a stint playing in a league."

        "date": "Wed Aug  2 18:05:00 2023",
        "body": "Home and away fixtures? A 34,000-seater stadium in New York? If the league can build on the momentum it has already generated, why not?\n\nWhen considering that USA's first home ODI in September 2019 only drew 19 people, that too for games staged in the country's only ICC-accredited venue at the time, in Florida, the bar of expectations couldn't have been set lower for what constitutes success when it comes to getting fans to turn out for a domestic cricket event in the USA. In a sense, the only way to go was up when starting from that foundation.\n\nThat's all the more reason why the events of the last three weeks, in which the first season of the Major League Cricket T20 franchise tournament routinely played to sold-out venues in North Carolina and Texas, were all the more startling. What many people, including the organisers themselves, thought might take several seasons to gain momentum in terms of fan attendance and player buy-in wound up being more supercharged than a case of Red Bull in season one.\n\nRelated\n\nMLC projected to spend $110 million on facilities ahead of 2023 launch\n\nCan cricket's American dream become a reality?\n\nTexas brings the vibe and welcomes franchise cricket to America\n\nCricket through the eyes of two baseball fans in America\n\nMajor League Cricket's conundrum: who exactly is an American player?\n\n\"My thought was we'll start slow, we'll get some fans in, we'll entertain them, we'll put out a good product, and then we'll build upon it year on year,\" MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta told ESPNcricinfo after the conclusion of the tournament final in Texas. \"I feel like we've skipped a couple of years now in our journey and we can start doing the things now which we'd be doing two years from now.\"\n\nAccording to MLC tournament director Justin Geale, league officials were counting on the opening night and the final to be sold out, but had no expectations as to everything in between, particularly from the seven match days in Grand Prairie, Texas. What unfolded was way beyond his cautiously optimistic expectations. On average, Grand Prairie Stadium wound up playing to more than 80% capacity across the nine match dates held at the 7,200-capacity venue, while the six-day slate of fixtures at the 3,000-capacity Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, all sold out. It meant that more than 70,000 fans - generating $2.8 million in ticket sales revenue - came through the gates to watch season one of MLC, a staggering number for any matches on US soil not involving India's routine visits to Lauderhill to play T20Is against the West Indies.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable part of all of this is that these numbers were possible in spite of dismal attendances for the three afternoon games held as part of scheduled double-headers at Grand Prairie Stadium, which were shoehorned into the calendar in spite of the oppressive daytime heat - temperatures regularly hovered over 110 degrees Fahrenheit (mid 40s Celsius) - in order to squeeze the tournament into a tight window following the end of the World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe and before the start of the Hundred in England. Addressing that is a key priority heading into season two.\n\nTwo solutions have been floated by MLC officials, either moving the afternoon match back to an early-morning start on days where two matches need to be played, or scheduling double-headers in different cities on the same day, one in the east coast time zone in the late afternoon or early evening before coming back to Texas for a 7:30 or 8 pm start. The fact that a split-venue double-header is even plausible despite the added broadcast production costs - one source tabbed it at a minimum of $350,000 - shows how supercharged the plans are for season two just days after the conclusion of season one.\n\nNow that MLC officials have the proof of concept that they can sell out a 7,200-seat venue multiple times in the space of a week, they aren't holding back with bigger-picture ambitions. Among those is a goal to \"piggyback\" off the proposed plan put forward by the ICC last week to have a 34,000-seat pop-up venue in New York City at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. If that proposal gets greenlit by NYC officials for the ICC to proceed with as one of three venues in the USA when it co-hosts the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, Mehta says he is already in discussions to make it the home venue for reigning champions MI New York in MLC season two next July, immediately after the T20 World Cup final scheduled for June 30.\n\n\"That would be very very desirable for us and we have indicated as much to the ICC,\" Mehta said. \"We'd love to collaborate with them not just on venues, but also in marketing and other aspects. If 2024 is going to be a watershed year for both MLC and the ICC, from our perspective a longer season and a much more impactful season and a season where we have some time and space to properly market and properly showcase the product. From the ICC's perspective, the World Cup is a huge event. So we'd just love to collaborate with them on venues and marketing and a few other elements. And they've indicated a reciprocal desire to want to make sure that we utilise next summer to completely evangelise the sport here.\"\n\nThe Texas Super Kings were by far the best-supported franchise in year one, with all their home games selling out. But the sold-out final - in which an extra 800 standing-room-only tickets were put on sale in the 48 hours before play began, to expand capacity by another 10% to accommodate a late surge in demand from MI New York fans - highlighted the biggest priority of all for the next few years of the league, according to Mehta. Long-term stadium infrastructure plans are now of paramount importance in the short term if the league is going to not only sustain but build on this year's success.\n\n\"We need home and away venues,\" Mehta said, alluding to the lowest-attendance match of the season between San Francisco Unicorns and LA Knight Riders at the end of the first week of matches in Texas, which saw approximately 2,500 fans turn out in Grand Prairie. \"I think all the team owners saw it clearly. It's one thing to put it up in a presentation and to raise funds. It's another thing for team owners to see directly themselves that here's what happens when you have a home venue, because all American franchise sport is built around home venues and a home-and-away concept.\n\n\"So they are far more enthusiastic now and now that they've seen it firsthand about building home venues and quickly building them. So that's been the number one benefit of this season. The reception the Texas Super Kings got was frankly something that all the owners had to see for themselves to understand that now they need to put their plans into action very quickly.\"\n\nThere were other teething issues that the league adapted to on the fly during season one. But often they were good problems to have - and certainly not the kind that US cricket administrators have ever thought they'd encounter - such as fans waiting too long in lines to get through the entrance gates. Other fan experience enhancements were added as the season progressed, whether it was a T-shirt-launching cannon shooting freebies into the crowd during breaks in play or free giveaways to fans coming through the gates.\n\nThe fervour shown by the fans, though, is something money can't buy. For anyone who thought MLC was going to be a one-and-done afterthought, think again.\n\nPeter Della Penna is ESPNcricinfo's USA correspondent @PeterDellaPenna"

Over the past few months, we have worked diligently with Ace to ensure that the MLC and MiLC are positioned well to support the growth of cricket in the United States,” read the statement.\n\n“We are pleased with Ace‘s commitment and best efforts to include all the current men’s national team players in the major league tournament. Additionally, we look forward to working with Ace to provide governance of the tournaments,” the statement informed further.\n\nPurple Cap: Check Out Full List for Top Bowlers in Purple Cap Race\n\nUSA Cricket also revealed that they will ‘review’ their relationship with Ace in the upcoming months.\n\n“Finally, we will review our commercial relationship with Ace over the next few months. We wish all the teams and players much success in this 2023 tournament,” read the statement further.\n\nAfter being sanctioned, both tournaments have been given green light, ICC, the global cricketing body had earlier deemed MLC and Minor League Cricket as “disapproved”.\n\nThe apex board also asked its member nations to not issue NOCs to their players to participate in either event, but after getting sanctioned, that stumbling block would also perish.\n\nIPL 2023: Orange Cap Complete List of Batters with Most Runs, Check here\n\nThe inaugural edition of the MLC will kick-start in July with the five franchises from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas, Seattle, Washington DC and New York set to take part. Four of the five franchises are also backed by IPL owners, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals."

        "date": "Tue Aug  1 13:29:11 2023",
        "body": "It’s Faf du Plessis on strike as the famous Bollywood song Aaj ki party blares from the loudspeaker and a tantalising aroma of spices fills the air while the spectators — holding love for cricket in their hearts and biryani in their trays — roam around trying to get to their seats.\n\nThe setting has all the makings of a cricket match in India or Pakistan but if that’s your guess, you’ve got the geography completely wrong.\n\nIn the outskirts of Dallas, Texas lies a city named Grand Prairie that many have not heard of, and likewise is the town named Morrisville in North Carolina. One thing common between the two places is that they co-hosted United States’ first franchised T20 league, which came to an end on Monday with the victory of MI New York.\n\nCricket in the land of baseball, and that too at two lesser known venues could give sceptics the reason to doubt if the twin experiments would work. However, the heart pounding cricket encounters that displayed the determination of players to the electrifying music that resonated with the rhythm of the crowd, Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park turned cricket’s American dream into reality.\n\n“It is in our blood, us Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, cricket is in our blood,” said Swethan Srinivasan, executive committee member of Triangular Cricket League (TCL) in Morrisville.\n\nTCL is a non-profit organization that aims to promote the game in North Carolina among both adults and youth.\n\nIt started as a recreational league for adults to play cricket but now boasts multiple youth programs with a coaching staff that has produced many players for the U-19 national team in the US.\n\nIt also contributed to getting the Church Street Park facility built, which has hosted many notable events, including the 2018 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Americas Qualifiers and Minor League Cricket.\n\nSwethan, who is originally from Chennai and has been in the US for last sixteen years, works tirelessly as a volunteer to help cricket grow merely out of his love for the game that roots back to his time in his home country.\n\n“Everybody is a volunteer here and nobody gets paid except for some of our employed coaches. All the management and people who do other various things are volunteers.”\n\nThe love for cricket among South Asians runs deep and transcends boundaries, encompassing national pride, communal celebration, and a sense of identity that unites millions under one captivating bat and ball symphony.\n\n“I am supporting the team with Haris Rauf and Shadab Khan because I am very very Pakistani,” said Memhudah Rehman while holding a Pakistani flag during San Francisco Unicorns’ match against Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium on Tuesday.\n\nRehman, who is originally from Karachi, lives in Dubai and was in the US to visit her family in New York. They travelled all the way from the east coast to Texas only to watch an MLC match.\n\n“When I walked in here I got stunned; the vibe, the environment, the lighting, the stadium itself, there is (are) actually good pitches here, in America. I never thought I would see actual cricket pitches so it is really amazing and the turnout, it is not even the weekend night. It is crazy,” she said excitedly as flocks of people moved by.\n\nMLC is first of its kind T20 franchise marquee event in the country featuring six teams and numerous international stars including Rashid Khan, Andre Russell, Faf du Plessis, David Miller, Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Aaron Finch, Jason Roy, and many others.\n\nThe league is founded by Vijay Srinivasan and Sameer Mehta, co-founders of Willow TV, the largest broadcaster of cricket in North America.\n\n“We wanted to prove that the US is capable of holding and staging an event of this stature and scale and I think we have accomplished that,” said Vijay, who grew up in Delhi and migrated to the States in 1989 for his undergraduate studies.\n\nHe has been involved in cricket in the country for over twenty years now.\n\n“I grew up in India, playing cricket and watching cricket. It meant everything to me,” he said. “I have been very fortunate that I have been involved in cricket for a good part of my professional life through Willow and now through Major League Cricket and I’m very lucky that I have managed to make cricket part of my professional life and also my personal passion. Very few people are lucky that way.”\n\nThe businessman plans to grow the game in the US by bringing in international stars, building new stadiums and training facilities in hopes of growing domestic talent. The idea behind creating a cricket league in the US was also to bring the game closer to fans who never had the opportunity to watch their favorite stars here.\n\n“We have only managed to bring MLC to two cities so far but the response in both those cities has been amazing, and the fans have come out in huge numbers,” Vijay said. “We are really excited to bring this game here that so many fans love and have grown up.”\n\nHamza Khan, a 12-year-old from Austin who plays cricket for Hill County Cricket Association, was sporting Pakistan’s cricket team jersey at Grand Prairie Stadium to show his support for Shadab Khan.\n\nIt was his first time watching a cricket match in the US. He previously traveled to England in 2019 to watch his favourite players play in Edgbaston during ICC Men’s ODI World Cup.\n\n“I am very happy that I have a chance to actually watch a game and I do not have to go to a different country like I did for the other match,” the 7th grader said. “It is my favorite sport; I really enjoy watching it. Some of my favorite players are here today.”\n\nIt was Texas Super Kings (TSK), however, whose fans outnumbered the fans of all other franchises. The Yellow Army supported the home team not only in Dallas, but showed up in huge numbers in North Carolina as well in bright yellow jerseys and their signature buckets hats as they waved TSK flags.\n\nBut one could have wondered if it really was Texas they were supporting or the popular Chennai-based franchise from the Indian Premier League. The suspicions grew as even when David Miller smacked sixes off Adam Zampa and Sunil Narine in the opening game, the crowd was busy chanting “Dhoni, Dhoni”.\n\n“I am supporting TSK in the memory of MS Dhoni,” said Jisha Patel, who had come from Coppell to watch Texas play against MI New York with her family on Monday.\n\n“TSK is a part of CSK and Dhoni is a part of CSK so, me and family are really hoping that Dhoni would come and play for TSK,” said the 40-year-old, who was watching her first MLC match. “If Dhoni comes, I would not miss a match.”\n\nWhile the US is known for its diversity, there was not much of it on display during the ongoing T20 tournament. From the investors to the crowd, from team owners to the players, from food vendors to event officials, a vast majority of it was formed by the South Asian diaspora.\n\nAs this budding love affair continues, and cricket’s roots dig deeper into the American soil, one could hope for an even more vibrant community that brings people together regardless of their cultural background."

        "body": "A few miles west of where Houston’s highway sprawl fades from a parade of superstores into the steamy low countryside, a slight rise in U.S. 290 reveals a surprise: six perfect circles of close-cropped grass clustered on the prairie like petals on an enormous flower. Here, spread across 86 acres and just an hour’s drive from the heart of the city, the nation’s largest and most advanced collection of cricket grounds attracts hundreds of athletes every week from around the Houston area—and often from around the country.\n\nThis is the Prairie View Cricket Complex, and on a recent Sunday, as the national junior cricket championships unfolded before him, the Texan who envisioned this place and paid to build it took a seat on the metal bleachers to explain how it all happened, and what it signified. Sporting mirrored aviator sunglasses, a body-hugging T-shirt, and a carefully groomed field of salt-and-pepper stubble, Tanweer Ahmed quickly rolled the clock back to 1988, when he arrived in this country from Pakistan at age twenty, with $23 to his name.\n\nHe’d come for the American dream but quickly realized there would be no handouts, he said. He took two jobs, one at a gas station and one at a Jack in the Box, and started learning English by watching American movies, especially The Terminator. He’d been working since he was ten years old back in Pakistan, selling vegetables from his family’s farm outside the city of Sialkot, and he’d managed to pay for two years of college there as well—so he was quick to impress his American bosses. By 1991 KFC hired Ahmed as a store manager. He was on his way.\n\nToday Ahmed, who lives in Houston, is one of the country’s largest fast-food franchise owners, with some four hundred KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell restaurants in four states. His passion, though, is cricket. And beginning about five years ago, he decided it was time to start paying his success forward—by investing heavily in the sport in Texas and building the Prairie View complex. “The whole idea that I have is, I came to this country, this country blessed me, and now I owe something back,” he told me.\n\nCricket is the world’s second-most-popular sport, Ahmed explained, with more than a billion fans, the vast majority of them from the Indian subcontinent. Meanwhile, Indians, Pakistanis, and other South Asians today make up the fastest-growing demographic group in the U.S., at 5.4 million strong. And Texas has the country’s second-largest South Asian population, just behind California and ahead of New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. The math wasn’t hard: cricket was wildly underrepresented in the nation’s landscape of recreational opportunities.\n\nAhmed’s complex in Prairie View is one of many in the U.S.—with a crucial but subtle difference. At the center of each circular field, under a rectangle of even finer turf, lies a layer of clay soil that has been rolled so flat and hard that a leather cricket ball will bounce as if on concrete—a differentiator from baseball because of how many variables this feature introduces to pitching and batting. Most of the other U.S. cricket grounds use artificial grass for the infield playing surface, a cost-saving measure that purists say just doesn’t offer the same quality of bounce. In Plano, Russell Creek Park claims to be the only park in the country with seven cricket fields, all with synthetic infields. Ahmed, ever the entrepreneur, saw an opportunity to level up.\n\nHe wasn’t the only Texas businessman to see an angle. Around the time Ahmed was starting his management career with KFC, another South Asian immigrant, Anurag Jain, was beginning business school at the University of Michigan. Jain, who moved to the U.S. from Chennai, India, when he was in his early twenties, had grown up as a talented but raw cricketer who dreamed of playing professionally but who instead followed his father’s advice to pursue a more sensible career.\n\nAs Jain earned an MBA and embarked upon a career as an entrepreneur in health-care IT, he fed his cricket addiction by getting up at three or four in the morning to watch live matches broadcast from the other side of the planet—a ritual shared by many of his South Asian peers in this country. “We’ve got this strange dual life where we’ve tried to keep in touch with cricket while we live our normal lives in the U.S.,” he told me. He longed to find his way back to the sport in a bigger way and loved the idea of building up American cricket—”but for the longest time it was just too much money.”\n\nThen Plano-based Perot Systems, an IT firm created by Ross Perot and his son, bought one of Jain’s first companies, Vision Healthsource, in 2003. Jain moved to the Dallas area, and he and Ross Perot Jr. began investing in other projects together. That was right as the sport of cricket itself began to change. Traditionally, a single match lasted five days, and even then it often didn’t result in a winner. A one-day format emerged in the 1970s, but it wasn’t until 2003 that another change allowed matches to be completed in three and a half hours—a format known as T20 cricket. The Indian Premier League debuted in 2008, and it quickly turned T20 matches into the kind of live television Western audiences are used to, complete with cheerleaders and Bollywood celebrity appearances. Seemingly overnight, a gentleman’s pursuit turned into a high-scoring bat-and-ball sport that made baseball look sleepy. “And that,” said Jain, “became the future of the sport.”\n\nBy the late 2010s, he and Ross Jr. had set up a venture capital firm, Perot Jain, and built a strong professional network in Silicon Valley. That’s where Jain found his opportunity: a start-up called Major League Cricket. Ahmed, as it turned out, discovered the same opportunity at about the same time.\n\nAs Ahmed and Jain were starting to dream of a thriving cricket culture in Texas, two tech entrepreneurs in the Bay Area, Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, were looking at the same trends and dreaming of a media and sports empire. They’d left their start-up jobs in the early aughts and launched a pay-TV channel dedicated to cricket. Willow TV, named for the type of wood in a cricket bat, didn’t become an immediate household name in the U.S., but it didn’t need to: by aggregating matches from around the world for Western audiences, the network turned the U.S. into the world’s fourth-largest cricket media market.\n\nThe number of talented cricketers emerging in India to play in the IPL had meanwhile started to outpace the number of opportunities in the league, and players began looking for jobs in other cricket-loving areas—Australia, the Caribbean, England, South Africa. That’s when Mehta and Srinivasan hit on the idea to start a professional league in the U.S., and Major League Cricket was born. They’d already proven a fan base existed here, so why not bring those supporters an original product? And if Major League Soccer could set its sights on eventually competing for attention with professional baseball and basketball, why not cricket?\n\nThe idea isn’t as far-fetched as it might sound. Cricket has a long history in the U.S. There’s even evidence of George Washington’s troops playing “wickets” at Valley Forge in 1778. That makes sense, because the sport spread with British imperialism as a way to inculcate British values in colonial subjects. Cricket faded in the U.S. in the late 1800s as baseball took hold, largely because the American game didn’t require the same kind of perfectly flattened and groomed turf. But now that so many new Americans come from India and other parts of the former British empire, there’s a natural symmetry to cricket’s contemporary return.\n\nAs word of Mehta and Srinivasan’s plan spread through the loose network of U.S.-based South Asian business leaders, it quickly found its way to Jain and Ahmed, both of whom signed on as investors in a $44 million round of funding by the league. Also piling money into MLC from its earliest days were Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Adobe Chairman and CEO Shantanu Narayan, and the principals of major venture-capital firms such as Madrona Venture Group and Rocketship VC.\n\nIt was a powerful group of people, all of whom brought their own considerable egos and financial ambitions, but all of whom also shared an underlying passion for the game that ran much deeper than the dollars at stake. “It’s sort of a badge of honor,” the league’s head of marketing, Tom Dunmore, told me. “American cricket is fortunate that many people who love it are immigrants who have come here and done well, and they can afford to invest in the sport or build a cricket pitch.” It’s different from soccer, he pointed out, because you can’t just whip up a game on any old playing surface. “But there’s a lot of community benefit that comes with setting up and maintaining cricket infrastructure.”\n\nEven with all of their competing interests, it didn’t take long for the league’s backers to zero in on Texas as MLC’s early center of gravity. Several of the most powerful investors were here—not just Ahmed and Jain, but also Ross Perot Jr., who signed on alongside his business partner and has a long history of doing business in India. There was also Ahmed’s complex in Prairie View, which the league decided to use as a training ground and a site for junior tournaments and other player-development projects. And there was the fact that moguls and teams from Seattle and San Francisco could fly to Texas for matches just as easily as those from New York and Washington, D.C.\n\nBut perhaps most important, when the league set out to find a stadium to host its first matches, it found the perfect site in Grand Prairie, the Dallas suburb sandwiched between Irving and Arlington, just south of Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport. A former independent league baseball stadium built in 2008 for the now-defunct Texas AirHogs, the grounds would require a substantial redesign and renovation, but that would cost half as much as constructing a new stadium. And the league quickly found that building in Texas is a lot easier than in, say, California. “The fact is, we get stuff done in Texas, and the regulators are helpful,” Jain said. “You can come here and within a year or two have all the permitting done and a stadium up and running. It’s so much easier to do business here, and you don’t realize that until you go other places.”\n\nOn an early June morning in Grand Prairie, just over a month before the opening day of MLC’s inaugural season, construction workers were preparing to pour concrete to form one of the last remaining sections of the stadium risers to be built, and another crew was repainting the VIP suites upstairs. (The season, which began July 13, will run as a two-week-long tournament, featuring eighteen total matches between six teams.) Out on the field, the central rectangular area—the pitch—was roped off to protect its turf, while sprinklers doused the sand covering the rest of the circular playing field. A shipment of sod would be showing up that afternoon, to be laid down on an eleven-inch-deep bed of highly specific sandy soil approved by the United States Golf Association, the nation’s reigning authority on sand for turf sports.\n\nDave Agnew, a tousle-haired Aussie who has built cricket pitches all over the world and whom MLC brought to Dallas to work full-time getting this one just right, oversaw the field work, while William Swann, another tall Australian, managed the entire $20 million construction project. Their jobs weren’t easy. Baseball and cricket share some obvious attributes—pitchers, batters, fielders—but the playing fields and surrounding structures are not easily transferable between the two sports. The entire stadium, save for the suites, had to be gutted to make room for the circular field. Where the baseball field had been two and a half acres, the new cricket surface is four. Even so, MLC managed to increase the stadium capacity from about five thousand to seven thousand fans.\n\nOn top of that, Russia invaded Ukraine a few weeks before work began last spring, and the resulting supply chain snarls slowed down plans from day one. A backup generator the crew ordered last summer had a 54-week lead time, meaning it should arrive just in time for the season. Meanwhile, a rainy spring this year has interrupted work days over and over. When all that expensive soil and sand turns to mud, concrete trucks can’t pass through the pitch to work on the stands for at least a few days.\n\nBut for all the potential construction snags, one of Swann’s biggest concerns was the relative paucity of luxury amenities and suites. “We have thirteen suites and two clubrooms, and once you go through the list of high–net worth individuals who will be coming, you quickly start to run out of suite space,” he said. Earlier this year, several teams from the Indian Premier League invested in MLC teams, and that introduced a whole new layer of wealth and influence to the mix. The New York MLC team, for instance, became MI New York, a reference to the Mumbai Indians, owned by the Indian oil conglomerate Reliance Industries, whose chairman, Mukesh Ambani, is Asia’s richest man and the world’s richest sports-team owner. The Dallas-based Texas Super Kings became affiliated with the Chennai Super Kings, a club owned by a powerful Indian cement company.\n\nAside from upgrading the furniture in the suites and updating the concessions to include samosas and roti wraps alongside hot dogs, there’s not much more Swann’s crew can do to accommodate the league’s VIPs. But the dilemma about adequate luxury space speaks to the size of the opportunity in U.S. cricket.\n\nOne of the most important areas of the stadium is an expanse of concrete on the concourse level that’s big enough to host sponsor activations—to show off a new car model, say. “You’ve got to pay the bills,” as Swann put it. The more built-in potential there is for sponsors, the more they’ll pay, the more the league can grow, and so on. The six teams competing this year (representing Los Angeles; New York; San Francisco; Seattle; Washington, D.C.; and Texas) will grow to eight at some point in the next few years, if all goes according to plan, with further goals of expansion down the line. Each franchise will ultimately want a home stadium. And once there are world-class cricket stadiums around the country, they can host international events. Already the 2024 T20 World Cup plans to hold some matches in Grand Prairie.\n\nAs Swann and Agnew talked field specs and growth opportunities, a young Sri Lankan woman who works in digital marketing for the league, Zayanya de Alwis, listened quietly and then interjected that the opportunity goes beyond cricket’s existing fan base. “We want the South Asian community to come out, but we also want to let American kids know about it,” she said. Where she lives, in the Bay Area, the younger generation is already “cricket mad,” she said, especially in the Silicon Valley corridor between San Francisco and San Jose, where practically every high school has a competitive cricket club. Here in North Texas, some public schools in Frisco have similar groups, but others aren’t there yet. As MLC builds out its infrastructure in Texas, de Alwis has started reaching out to more schools and groups such as the Grand Prairie ISD phys ed teachers and the Grand Prairie Police Department, which puts on sports-focused summer camps.\n\nYouth cricket may represent the future of American cricket, but the sport also needs adult fans now. One of the boldest projects on that front is taking shape about thirty miles north of the stadium, at Grandscape, a sprawling shopping mall and entertainment complex in the Denton County suburb the Colony. Here, just across a sidewalk from an indoor go-karting palace and something called the Puttery (“immersive, adults-only mini golf, craft cocktails, and upscale eats”), the first American location of Sixes Social Cricket, a new kind of sports bar, opened last month.\n\nInside, a row of electric-orange batting cages and scoreboards flanks a bar and restaurant area. Diners choose from sandwiches such as the Delhi Smasher (chicken with Indian seasonings) and the Sri Lankan Fielder (a veggie burger) while taking turns batting against virtual bowlers (pitchers) who hurl balls from large video screens at the far end of each fenced-in cage. Purple, green, orange, and blue stripes cover every surface of the room, in varying sizes and orientations. “We were going for that Paul Smith look,” the company’s cofounder and CEO, Calum Mackinnon, told me. “But also, we want people to walk in here and go, ‘What’s going on?’ If people don’t do that, we haven’t done a good enough job.”\n\nOne afternoon a couple weeks before the grand opening, Mackinnon, who previously ran a small chain of Scottish restaurants in the United Kingdom, took a break from final preparations to demonstrate his bar’s game technology. As a Scotsman, he hadn’t grown up with cricket (“It’s really more of an English thing,” he said), but he’d found himself drawn to the growing trend of so-called social-entertainment restaurants—places like the Puttery and Topgolf. After a concept for a whiskey bar with virtual hunting failed to take off because of COVID-19 disruptions, he turned his attention to cricket. “And as soon as we opened this in the UK, the feedback was overwhelming,” Mackinnon said. “We got more than four hundred franchise requests from all over the world in just a year and a half.” With eight locations in the UK up and running and with MLC starting up here, opening in the Dallas suburbs felt like a natural next step.\n\nIn cricket, the term “six” is the equivalent of a home run in baseball, and the batting cages at Sixes register where players hit the ball and assign scores accordingly. After a couple of whiffs, Mackinnon hit a six. “It’s not like baseball, where the ball’s flying at you a hundred miles an hour,” he said. “People can pick this up relatively quickly, and it’s all about getting points, getting people competitive.” Typically, he said, people get better with a few drinks in them. “My sweet spot is four or five pints. Then it goes remarkably downhill quite fast.”\n\nHe’s in close contact with MLC, and he said a couple of his batting cages would eventually end up in the Grand Prairie stadium as amenities for fans and marketing vehicles for the restaurant. But ultimately, “we don’t really market to the cricketers,” he said. “The cricketers will find us. There’s such a huge South Asian population around here, they’ll be excited and bring their noncricketing friends, and that will create positive momentum.” He’d seen it work already in the UK: “Eighty percent of the people that come to Sixes there have never played cricket before.”\n\nBack at Tanweer Ahmed’s Prairie View Cricket Complex, out on Field 5, a sixteen-year-old player named Aarin Nadkarni sprinted from the far edge of the round field toward the center, where a batter stood at one end of a rectangular strip in front of the wicket, a formation of three sticks in the ground with two smaller sticks balanced across the top of them. As he reached the far end of the rectangle, Nadkarni windmilled his outstretched right arm overhead in a violently fast circle and released a leather ball, smaller and harder than a baseball. His whole body pitched forward with his momentum, a mane of wavy black hair bouncing around the edges of his yellow ball cap as he braked to a stop and the batter took a swing.\n\nIt was the penultimate game of a weekend-long tournament that’s part of the MLC under-seventeen cricket championships, and Aarin’s Houston-based MSCA Hurricanes were facing a squad from New Jersey. In T20 cricket, each team gets one turn at bat and another fielding. The Houston boys batted the first half of this match, scoring a respectable 164 runs, and now it was time to try to hold their opponents to fewer. Aarin, his coach told me from the sideline, is one of the country’s top young fast bowlers (essentially a pitcher with a mean fastball), and the strategy today was to bowl aggressively from the outset to neutralize the opposing team’s top two or three batters early.\n\nThe Houston coach, Sushil Nadkarni, is also Aarin’s dad. Like Jain and Ahmed, he came to this country as a young man, in his case from the Indian city of Pune in 1999, to pursue a master’s degree at Texas A&M–Kingsville. After grad school, Nadkarni began a career doing environmental-impact management for a multinational consulting firm with clients in the oil and gas industry. He also played competitive cricket. He’d been an elite youth player in India, even making the under-nineteen national team, and he quickly came to dominate the American cricket scene, becoming captain of Team USA and the best batter in the sport’s domestic history, with a practically unfathomable batting average of 51.3 percent. “The next highest was thirty-six,” he offered proudly.\n\nBetween bites of a taco for lunch in the bleachers, Nadkarni kept one eye on his team as he described how he started Master Strokes Cricket America, the first training academy of its kind in the Houston area, in a Katy strip mall in 2015. Today there are dozens of academies around Texas’s biggest cities, Nadkarni said—“one on every corner” in some areas. At MSCA, players learn batting and bowling skills and work on physical conditioning.\n\nIt’s the kind of training Nadkarni received in India, and it wasn’t available in this country until recently. On the field, the quality of cricket the boys play here isn’t quite up to the level of equivalent Indian or Pakistani teams, Nadkarni said, but it’s not far off. The difference is not the amount of raw talent here. “It’s the amount of cricket played,” he explained. “In India they’re playing three or four games a week.” It’s just a part of the culture there, in the way that kids play basketball or soccer here.\n\nFor now, as cricket remains a niche sport, playing seriously is an expensive proposition for young athletes. Many of the players come from white-collar families. It costs a thousand dollars to attend a good academy for a year, plus another thousand or two in various tournament fees. Then there’s expensive gear to buy and the cost of family trips for travel tournaments. “It’s easily twenty or twenty-five thousand dollars a year,” Nadkarni said—and unlike many other sports, that doesn’t currently come with the potential payoff of a college scholarship.\n\nFor Aarin Nadkarni, who grew up in a cricket household and watches all the cricket he can on Willow, the start of Major League Cricket holds up the possibility that he could have a bright future in the sport in this country—without having to moonlight, as his dad always did. In addition to youth competitions, MLC also runs a set of minor league teams, and both efforts aim specifically to develop the next generation of pros. While most of the major league players will be foreign nationals, franchises are required to maintain a minimum number of U.S. residents on their rosters, with plans to also maintain dedicated slots for younger players. Aarin hopes to be one of the first to enter that pipeline, though he’s planning to go to college as a backstop.\n\nA second-generation immigrant in suburban Houston, Aarin is every bit as Texan as he is Indian. He follows football and basketball, but rather than getting pulled away from cricket toward those American pastimes, he has found space for all three in his life, and he sees a similar blending of cultures happening among his peers as cricket becomes increasingly baked into life in the States. “Almost all of our parents are immigrants, and we consider ourselves American,” he said. “But we think cricket is a good sport. It’s just a part of me.”\n\nAarin’s team lost the game that afternoon in Prairie View—he successfully bowled out two of the most dangerous New Jersey batsmen, but the third got the better of him. “He was the highest run scorer in the tournament and ended up taking the match away from us,” Aarin said later. The Hurricanes lost again the next day playing a team from North Carolina. The Houston boys entered the weekend ranked first of the thirty teams playing and, despite the losses, ended up still in the top four based on the tournament’s scoring system. It was the first of three tournaments that will eventually crown the MLC youth national champions in December.\n\nAhmed believes playing cricket teaches important values. “You can’t have a gentleman’s game without patience and discipline,” he said. And self-reliance. “Whereas you can hide yourself on a soccer team, you cannot hide here. You will be exposed in a second.” (It also appears that knocking rival sports as lesser pursuits is one of fandom’s universal values.) He sees parallels between success on the pitch and his own bootstrapped fortune, and he worries that immigrant new Texans today lack the same drive. “The people who are coming over here now are different,” he said. “They believe you can pluck dollars off a tree and get rich overnight.”\n\nIt’s a belief that only furthers his commitment to building out a cricket culture in Houston. And, lately, Ahmed has considered entering politics. Ever since he met former U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo at an event last year, he’s begun spending time in Palm Beach, Florida, with Republican lawmakers and former Trump administration officials, whom he says are recruiting him to run for Congress.\n\nRegardless of that project, he’s working to make sure one of MLC’s first expansion teams lands in Houston, within the next five years. He’d originally wanted the Texas team there, close to his cricket complex, but the stadium opportunity in Grand Prairie—and Jain’s influence in Dallas and slightly larger ownership stake in the league—proved insurmountable. Between MLC, hosting next year’s T20 World Cup, and cricket becoming an Olympic sport in 2028, when the games will be held in Los Angeles, Ahmed believes, the U.S. will emerge as one of the premier cricket nations in the world.\n\nAfter the Hurricanes’ tournament game back in June ended and players started trickling away, Ahmed stopped one of them to chat—a fifteen-year-old named Danyal Bhagani, whose eighteen-year-old brother, Rayaan, plays on the Houston minor league team and is one of the best hopes for a local breakout cricketer, along with Aarin Nadkarni.\n\n“You see that?” Ahmed said to me after hearing how many runs the boy scored and wishing him good luck and hard work for the next day. “They moved here, he and his brother, two years ago from L.A. because of this.” He gestured around at the dream fields he had built, at the long stretch of highway frontage that functions as free advertising. Players were moving here to train at Sushil’s academy and be close to the country’s best cricket complex. Teams were flying in from the coasts to compete against them. “We can do a lot with this,” he said.\n\nA few weeks later, the temperature was 103 in Grand Prairie when Ross Perot Jr. bowled the ceremonial first ball of the first match of Major League Cricket. Outside the sold-out stadium, hundreds of frustrated fans stood in line for more than an hour to pass through a security bottleneck, and a police officer hurried to help someone who’d fainted in the heat."

Four of the six MLC sides are owned by investors of sides in the iconic Indian Premier League.\n\nPakistan national team players set to take part in the first MLC season between July 13 and 30 include Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, and Imad Wasim.\n\nSalman Iqbal, founder and chief executive of ARY Digital, said: “The launch of a ground-breaking professional cricket tournament in the US is an exciting development and I am glad that ARY is part of this new venture as the MLC’s official broadcast partner in Pakistan.\n\n“Cricket is making a grand entry into a market that holds huge potential and we hope that the audiences in Pakistan will enjoy our coverage of these matches.”\n\nARY adds MLC action to its already-substantial list of live cricketing rights, including for the Pakistan Super League T20 competition, international cricket organized by the Pakistan Cricket Board, and tournaments staged by the governing International Cricket Council.\n\nTom Dunmore, Major League Cricket’s vice-president of marketing, added: “We are thrilled to partner with ARY and deliver the adrenaline-packed T20 action Major League Cricket will feature to viewers across Pakistan.\n\n“We know how passionate fans in Pakistan are about cricket, and we’re excited that they will have the chance to see their favorite stars like Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, and Imad Wasim compete on an exciting new stage in the US.”\n\nThe first MLC season gets underway with the Texas Super Kings taking on the Los Angles Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in the Dallas region of Texas.\n\nApart from those two sides, the four other competing teams are MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom.\n\nMLC is owned by American Cricket Enterprises, a group that is backed by the founders of Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America. The company won a competitive tender in May 2019 to fund and develop a professional T20 league in the US. MLC has been planning to deploy more than $120 million to launch this year.\n\nIn early April, the league brought in creative agency JDA Worldwide as its brand identity partner."

The teams will then move back to Grand Prairie to participate in the playoffs.\n\nMI New York, the San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom are the remaining four teams, all featuring plenty of international cricket stars.\n\nMLC is a $120 million investment from multiple entities — mainly Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders of Willow TV, the largest broadcaster of cricket in North America.\n\nThe two businessmen plan to grow the game in the United States by bringing in international talent, and building stadiums and training facilities in hopes of cultivating the new generation of U.S. cricketers.\n\nCricket's future in the U.S. remains uncertain\n\nDespite being the world's second most-watched sport, behind soccer, cricket never managed to gain popularity in the U.S.\n\nSurkari said the new league's backers would like to change that and are marketing MLC to any American who likes bat-and-ball sport.\n\n\"The T20 format of cricket is very palatable to most people,\" Surkari said. \"Three hours of fun, getting ready for the stadium which has concession stands and lights and things for kids to do. It is like any other Minor League, Major League Baseball, but not just on that grand scale yet.\"\n\nHowever, Peter Della Penna, a former ESPN cricket writer, said the MLC has failed to cater to the sporting culture of the U.S. and has not done much to cultivate organic support from the general American public.\n\n\"A lot of the tickets have been given away as gifts to the families of the cricket players and organizers to fill in the stadium for the opening night,\" he said. \"There has been little to no effort made in terms of initiating grassroot level effort.\"\n\nPenna has been covering cricket in the U.S. for the past 18 years. He said that MLC's approach of developing cricket in the country is not different from that of USA Cricket (the men's and women's national cricket teams), as both have depended largely on migration patterns instead of building an organic pathway like other sports.\n\n\"There are a lot of people immigrating to participate in MLC but what does that say about the health and sustainability of the league and cricket more broadly in the country,\" Penna said. \"Instead of bringing in international stars that no Americans know about, cricket should rather be introduced as a high school league first which will create a pathway for it to be a NCAA Division 1 scholarship sport.\"\n\nCopyright 2023 NPR.

The ballpark would be designed to host Major League Cricket matches, Mason baseball games, and other events on the University’s Fairfax Campus in the Washington D.C. region.\n\nFunding support for the study and plan development comes from Govil, a founding investor in MLC, the Founder and Chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions and the CEO of Zyter. The effort represents part of MLC’s long-term strategic plan for American cricket, which also includes the launch of the first U.S. professional Twenty20 cricket league.\n\nWith a goal to be operational by Summer 2025, the ballpark at Mason would be home to an MLC franchise in the heart of one of the largest cricket-loving populations in the United States and feature an international-grade pitch. The pitch would meet International Cricket Council (ICC) accreditation and allow the ballpark to host the highest level of international cricket competition.\n\n“This study with Mason is an important milestone in a new era for Major League Cricket and international matches in the United States and brings new athletic resources to George Mason University and the region,” said Govil. “We look forward to taking the next steps to fully realize a vision for the first international cricket venue in the northeastern United States.”\n\n“Mason is the educational, economic and cultural hub of one of the most dynamic regions in the country and is the most diverse public university in Virginia,” Mason President Gregory Washington said. “This opportunity would bring the second-most popular global media sport to the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and base it at a location known for attracting international students and audiences. At the same time, this proposed facility would enhance the Mason athletic experience for our student-athletes, alumni network, and fan base.”\n\nMason’s main campus is located in Fairfax County, VA, home to more than one million people, with a thriving global community and adult and youth cricket leagues which provide a significant base of grassroots support for cricket in the area.\n\nIn collaboration with Mason on an innovative cross-functional design that would maximize facility utilization, MLC is working with internationally renowned architects HKS, one of the nation’s leading architecture firms which is developing multiple cricket stadium concepts for MLC nationwide.\n\n“Major League Cricket is grateful to George Mason University for working with us to plan an innovative facility that can maximize use for the venue during the college season for Mason baseball and then host world class cricket in the summer months,” said Sameer Mehta, co-founder, Major League Cricket.\n\nMEDIA CONTACTS\n\nTom Dunmore tom@majorleaguecricket.com\n\nJohn Hollis jhollis2@gmu.edu\n\nMaureen Nasser mnasser@gmu.edu\n\nABOUT MAJOR LEAGUE CRICKET\n\nMajor League Cricket will be the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States.

        "title": "America’s Major League Cricket Debut Surpassed Expectations On And Off The Field",
        "date": "Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Having \"exceeded all expectations\", with stirring contests in front of heaving crowds helping surpass its financial targets, the historic Major League Cricket has the foundations to build on as it eyes an expanded second season.\n\nThe debut of the well-heeled T20 tournament, as cricket seriously enters the world's biggest sports market, was deemed a resounding success. Even no nonsense Sunil Gavaskar, the Indian cricket legend and broadcaster at the MLC, was left impressed.\n\n\"He (Gavaskar) told me the quality of the cricket was high,\" Anand Rajaraman, San Francisco Unicorns co-owner, told me. \"He felt the international players were giving it their all and that the pitches were good, which is a ringing endorsement.\n\n\"The overseas players said the ground and pitch in Dallas was as good as anywhere they've played around the world.\n\n\"The tournament exceeded all expectations.\"\n\nThere was much anticipation over the MLC's launch with a lot riding on it considering the maligned status of American cricket over the years.\n\nWith over $100 million invested, aided by influential Indian businessmen some of whom are ensconced in Silicon Valley, the six-team tournament was able to lure high-profile international cricketers through attractive salaries.\n\nWith the U.S. home to a growing South Asian populace, there were plenty of passionate cricket fans eager to watch the matches in person even though some of the matches were rather bafflingly played in the sweltering Dallas heat.\n\nMore than 70,000 fans turned out to the 18-day tournament played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the rather modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThe broadcast was beamed to 87 countries worldwide and importantly some games were shown live on CBS Sports Network in the U.S.\n\n\"The tournament had revenues of around $8 million,\" said Rajaraman, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. \"Was more than we anticipated...we thought it would be lucky to make $5 million in the first season.\n\n\"We had a lot of sponsors reaching out. It was a success but there are learnings. Scheduling afternoon games was not ideal, they were hard to sell.\"\n\nThe MLC has been debriefing its first season with the tournament expected to announce its plans for the 2024 edition in the coming months.\n\nThe emotion from tournament administrators was understandable relief, knowing the tournament had lived up to the hype and avoided being the type of fool's gold project long associated with the tempestuous American cricket scene.\n\nBut there is much to work out before a defining second season hot on the heels of the landmark T20 World Cup in June, which will be co-hosted by the U.S. with matches played in New York, Dallas and Florida.\n\nA proper home and away season, where teams play each other twice, is on the cards, while there is hope the salary cap for the teams will rise, further enticing cricketers many of whom are already intrigued by playing on the big sports stage of the U.S.\n\nThere is an unknown over player drafts and movements, with those playing in the first edition having signed one-year contracts with options to extend.\n\n\"The ownership group in the MLC would like the next season to be a full season, but scheduling will be important,\" Rajaraman said. \"It will have to be after the T20 World Cup but not impact other (T20) leagues in August.\n\n\"It should last around a month and would need double headers, but hopefully not too many games played in the heat.\"\n\nAs expected, the tournament relied on the star power from its overseas signings to ensure the matches felt pretty similar in standard to most of the other T20 leagues cramming the cricket calendar.\n\nTeams were allowed six overseas players per starting eleven - more than the quota of four accepted in established leagues. Amid an outcry, fearing the sanctity of international cricket, governing body the ICC has tightened regulations with teams in official T20 leagues only allowed to field four overseas players.\n\nThis new rule does not come into effect for the MLC or the newly formed cashed-up UAE league, but there is an understanding that homegrown heroes need to be created for the tournament to truly resonate amongst the local populace.\n\n\"We have to get to four,\" Rajaraman said. \"There is no discussion on timeframe, it will probably be six to five to four. It (four) is the right place to be.\n\n\"It was amazing for the domestic players, exposure many had never dreamed of having. They will be much better for the experience.\"\n\nTo grow the tournament beyond a South Asian audience, as these newly formed franchises fight for air amid the congested American sports market, teams will need home grounds in a bid to build a connection with their communities.\n\nSignificant infrastructure is required, a daunting task given cricket is played on bigger grounds than baseball and requiring a pitch in the middle. For the Unicorns, a stadium in Santa Clara is in the works, but a temporary venue could be used next season.\n\n\"We had a fan event before the MLC in Freemont on the east bay and we had over 1200 people show up,\" Rajaraman said. \"We organized some watch parties in bars in the Bay Arena, there was an enthusiastic showing.\n\n\"Clearly there is interest and we are confident if we do have home games in the Bay Area, we would sell them out. Easily.\"\n\nExpectations will inevitably rise further, but there is little concern over complacency creeping in with everyone knowing the daunting task ahead with cricket desperate for visibility in its favored target market.\n\n\"We were just holding our breath on this tournament,\" Rajaraman said. \"We got this tournament to where we thought we would get to in the second or third year.\n\n\"There was a novelty factor in the first season, which won't be there in the second season. We have to consciously build on what we've started.\""

        "body": "Christchurch: Plagued by injuries, New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson, who once held the record for fastest ODI hundred, called time on his international career and signed a three-year deal with USA’s Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nThe 29-year-old, who has played 13 Tests, 49 ODIs and 31 T20Is for New Zealand, didn’t feature in any of Black Caps’ assignment for the past two years.\n\nIn the 93 international games across formats, he scored 2277 runs with two hundreds and 10 half-centuries. He also picked up 90 wickets.\n\n“It’s been a huge honour and (I am) extremely proud to represent New Zealand,” Anderson, who holds the record for the fastest ODI century for his 36-ball innings against West Indies in 2013, was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.\n\nHis 36-ball hundred against West Indies on New Year’s Day in 2014, was the fastest ODI hundred for a year before AB de Villiers’ broke the record with a 31-ball feat against the same opposition.\n\nAnderson lamented that he couldn’t play more internationals for his country.\n\n“I would have loved to have achieved and played more but just is what it is sometimes, and different opportunities arise and send you in a direction you never thought would be a possibility. Very appreciative for everything that NZC has done for me.”\n\nAnderson also played in the IPL for Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore and also was a part of New Zealand’s runners-up finish at the 2015 World Cup.\n\nHowever, his career was affected by multiple injuries, including a spate of stress fractures, groin injuries and chronic back issues. He last played a T20I for New Zealand in November 2018.\n\n“It hasn’t been an easy decision. I asked myself several questions. What do I want to do now or what do I want to achieve in the next two years, five years, 10 years?” he said.\n\n“As you get older you think about life a little bit more broadly as well. And obviously, my fiance, Mary Margaret, who’s born and raised in America, she’s had a massive part to play in that because she’s sacrificed so much for me.\n\n“So, when the opportunity arose, we thought that living in America is the best thing, not only for my cricket, but it’s, it’s the best thing for both of us in general as well.”\n\nAnderson recently featured in the Caribbean Premier League for the Barbados Tridents in August."

By the end of his innings, Pooran remained unbeaten at 137 runs off just 55 deliveries, hitting an astounding 13 sixes and 10 fours, securing the second-highest score by a captain batting second in T20 matches.\n\nNicholas Pooran assumed the leadership responsibilities for the team during the tournament due to an injury to Kieron Pollard. Despite the added responsibility, Pooran showcased exceptional batting skills and led the team to a memorable performance in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023 final.\n\nWith this, now the MI franchise has won a T20 league outside of the IPL as well after earlier MI Cape Town and MI Emirates failed to win their respective SA20 League or the International League T20 (ILT20).\n\nMumbai Indians is a five champions in the IPL and now the MI New York have won the inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket. Let’s take a look at the list of award winners and prize money in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023. (Note: Prize Money have not been mentioned, we will update as and when we have more information.)\n\nBest Domestic Player of the Tournament\n\nThe best domestic player of the tournament award went to the Seattle Orcas pacer Cameron Gannon. The Australia born USA cricketer played 7 matches and took 11 wickets.\n\nMost Wicket-taker of the tournament\n\nThe leading wicket-taker of the tournament award went to the champion team MI New York pacer Trent Boult. The Kiwi pacer picked-up a total of 22 wickets as part of this campaign.\n\nMost Run Scorer of the Tournament\n\nAs for the most run scorer of the tournament, it went to none other than the star of the final and the stand-in captain of the MI New York, Nicholas Pooran, who scored a total of 388 runs, way high of the 2nd placed man Heinrich Klaasen.\n\nMost Valuable Player\n\nAlso the most valuable player of the tournament went to the star of the final show, Nicholas Pooran, who scored and remained not out 137 runs in 55 balls. He batted with brilliant striker rate for whole of the tournament and deservedly won the award.\n\nRunners-up\n\nThe runners-up of the tournament were Seattle Orcas. They finished the tournament at the top of the points table winning 4 of the 5 matches they played. They beat Texas Super Kings in the qualifier 1 to directly qualify for the MLC 2023 Final.\n\nChampions\n\nMI New York are inaugural champions of the Major League Cricket. Despite finishing only 4 in the league table, they beat Washington Freedom in the Eliminator and then Texas Super Kings in the Qualifier 2 to book their slot for the final."

        "body": "The Major Cricket League has finally kicked off in the USA. The inaugural season of professional cricket, which has been sparking talks of a cricket revolution in the baseball-loving country, will see players from around the world come together under one roof to play 19 matches for the title. But the event is more than just cricket. From the likes of Satya Nadella claiming a stake in the games to AI recreating Indian flavours for the stands, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes. Here are six things you should know about the Major Cricket League (MLC):\n\nWhere is the MLC being played?\n\nAll 19 of these T20 matches will be played over at the newly-constructed Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. The Grand Prairie Stadium was originally a baseball ground. But the venue has now been renovated with 7,200 seats and a grass wicket to serve as a cricket stadium. The MLC 2023 championship is the first-ever cricket event to be hosted at the venue. Formerly home to the minor league baseball Texas AirHogs, it’s now one of the largest complex of cricket fields in the United States.\n\nCricket in the US… is it really a big deal?\n\nWith a sizable audience in its South Asian community, Texas is already witnessing a sold-out game. Cricket-loving diaspora, including Indian investors, make up for a majority of team-owners in the league. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella co-owns the Seattle Orcas, and is one of the major investors alongside Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan. Even before this, the state has had ample cricket activity, from Minor League Cricket events to Houston Women’s Opens. North Carolina is also a breeding ground for cricket enthusiasts, and regularly hosts Minor League Cricket at its cricket stadium in Morrisville.\n\nShould you expect the good old hot dog stand?\n\nFor MLC 2023, food startup CloudChef is using Artificial Intelligence to record and recreate Indian recipes, and will serve chef Saransh Goila’s Goila Butter Chicken fries, kebabs from chef Sherry Mehta and other dishes prepared by chefs like Thomas Zacharias. How? Movements of the chefs at work are fed into an AI model (with inputs from cameras, thermal sensors and other devices), which comes back with a programme that chefs at a cloud kitchen anywhere in the world can follow to create the exact same dish and flavours without the chefs having to do it themselves.\n\nWho’s playing?\n\nMLC 2023 is modelled on the Indian Premier League, and in fact, four of the six teams are owned by franchises of IPL–MI New York (Mumbai Indians), Texas Super Kings (Chennai Super Kings), LA Knight Riders (Kolkata Knight Riders) and the Seattle Orcas (Delhi Capitals). The other two teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom.\n\nEach team can have 16 to 19 member players, with at least one under-23 domestic player. The 110 players, in total, are a mix of international champions, including prominent names in Indian cricket such as Unmukt Chand and Sunil Narine. Also look out for former South Africa skipper Faf Du Plessis, Rashid Khan, Aaron Finch, Trent Boult and Jason Roy.\n\nWhat’s the schedule for the MLC?\n\nThe first eight matches are being played in Texas, after which the season will move to North Carolina. The playoffs and the final will be played in Texas. For the full schedule as per Indian Standard Time, head here.\n\nYou can watch MLC livestream from here in India"

The remaining two teams are owned by local American investors in collaboration with New South Wales Cricket and Victoria Cricket, with one based in Washington DC and the other in San Francisco.\n\nDuring the players’ draft, each team selected the core of their domestic squads. The marquee event took place at the Space Center Houston, which is the official visitor center of NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nLet’s have a look at the squads of all six MLC T20 teams after the players draft:\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Ali Khan, Unmukt Chand, Jaskaran Malhotra, Nitish Kumar, Corne Dry, Ali Sheikh, Saif Badar, Shadley Van Schalhywh, Bhaskar Yadram\n\nMI New York:\n\nSteven Taylor, Hammad Azam, Ehsan Adil, Nosthush Henjige, Monank Patel, Sarbjeet Ladda, Shayan Jahangir, Usman Rafiq, Saideep Ganesh\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns:\n\nAaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Corey Anderson, Liam Plunkett, Tajinder Singh, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Carmi Le Roux, Brody Couch, David White, Smit Patel, Sanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nSeattle Orcas:\n\nQuinton de Kock, Mitchell Marsh, Harmeet Singh, Shehan Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjani, Cameron Gannon, Aaron Jones, Nauman Anwar, Phani Simhadri, Angelo Perera, Matthew Tromp\n\nTeam Texas:\n\nRusty Theron, Calvin Savage, Lahiru Milantaha, Milind Kumar, Sami Aslam, Cameron Stevenson, Cody Chetty, Zia Shahzad, Saiteja Mukamalla\n\nWashington Freedom:\n\nAnrich Nortje, Wanindu Hasaranga, Andries Gous, Mukhtar Ahmed, Obus Pienaar, Saurabh Netravalhar, Saad Ali, Dane Piedt, Sujith Gowda, Justin Dill, Akhilesh Bodugum."

The league is expected to include an initial six franchises, one of which will be based in Dallas, where MLC recently received approval to redevelop AirHogs Stadium, a minor league baseball venue.\n\nIt has not been confirmed where the other five teams will play, but USA Cricket chief executive Iain Higgins told SportsPro in November that New York, New Jersey, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco and Los Angeles are among the US cities where cricket is most popular.\n\nACE’s Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan added in a joint statement: “By adding the Knight Riders Group to our family of world-class and diverse investors, this investment into the future of Major League Cricket is a huge validation of our vision for the new league, and we are particularly excited to have such an iconic cricketing brand onboard with us.\n\n“The announcement today is a significant step forward in showing the potential of the American market, and we are delighted to have the backing and expertise of the Knight Riders Group to help us achieve this vision.”"

        "date": "Tue Nov 15 16:04:12 2022",
        "body": "Major League Cricket have announced today the dates for their inaugural season.\n\nThe historic first Major League Cricket game will take place on July 13, 2023, at Grand Prairie Stadium in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex city of Grand Prairie, Texas. Spanning 18 days, the inaugural MLC season will feature 19 total matches between teams representing Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Seattle and New York City.\n\n“Next summer, the eyes of world cricket will be on the launch of Major League Cricket, with the stars of the game competing over three weeks of fast-paced T20 action,” Justin Geale, MLC Tournament Director, was quoted saying in the announcement. “The launch of MLC will transform American cricket and provide one of the best platforms in the sport for the world’s most elite players to showcase their skills while also fast-tracking the development of domestic talent to feature in the league.”\n\nThe 18 day window likely means good news for those hoping to see big International stars play in Major League Cricket. With the southern hemisphere in the middle of winter, and the International calendar fairly free, aside from the Ashes in England, fans can begin to speculate realistically about the stars they want to see playing alongside American domestic cricketers, who now have two years of Minor League Cricket behind them.\n\nThe Grand Prairie venue, currently under major reconstruction totalling $20 million, was once the home of the minor league baseball Texas Air Hogs, and is set to open in the spring of 2023 with a capacity of 7,200. Construction has commenced, and a ceremony today marks the installation of the playing pitch. The new cricket specific stadium will feature 1,000 club and premium seats, with the ability to expand capacity to 15,000 for major events. Grand Prairie will likely be a featured venue in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024, which will be staged in the United States and Caribbean.\n\nRecently hired MLC curator David Agnew has been tasked with creating the playing field and pitch at Grand Prairie. Agnew’s resume includes time curating Seddon Park in New Zealand, working in the Caribbean Premier League, both renditions of Canada’s Global T20, and building the pitch square at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina ahead of the 2018 ICC Americas T20 World Cup Qualifier.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium will serve as the primary venue for the inaugural season of Major League Cricket, and will be the home of the Dallas MLC franchise going forward. MLC has retained HKS as project architects. The firm was involved in the design of Super Bowl LVI site SoFi Stadium, AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, and Optus Stadium in Perth, Australia, which recently hosted India vs South Africa in the 2022 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. Manhattan Construction Company, builders of AT&T Stadium and Texas Rangers home venue Globe Life Field, is managing the construction.\n\nGrand Prairie Mayor, Ron Jensen, was quoted in the announcement, saying “Grand Prairie Stadium will be the best cricket venue in the United States upon its completion. This venue will be a huge asset to the Grand Prairie community, bringing Major League Cricket, international cricket and potentially the 2024 ICC T20 Men’s World Cup to Grand Prairie allowing fans here to experience a world class sport in action.”\n\nThe team name of the Dallas franchise and the other five franchises will be announced in early 2023, along with any additional venues. MLC have previously announced plans for a 10,000 seat stadium in Irvine, California, in partnership with Shah Rukh Khan, and have secured exclusive negotiating rights with Santa Clara County, with their sights set on building in San Jose.\n\nTwo seasons of Minor League Cricket have preceded the launch of the Major League, featuring 26 teams, coast to coast, and 200 games per season, spanning ten weeks. The unprecedented scale and length of Minor League Cricket should help prepare MLC selectors for drafting the best domestic talent on offer."

At every Olympics, the IOC allows the host city to select a few sports unique to its own sports culture.\n\nTangent\n\nFlag football is a variation of American football, the most popular sport in the U.S., and the NFL was involved in the sport’s bid. Additionally, the U.S. is set to co-host the 2024 Twenty20 Cricket World Cup alongside the West Indies, and in July, Major League Cricket, a startup attempting to bring the hugely popular sport to the U.S., completed its inaugural championship in Texas. Baseball (which, along with softball, was invented in the U.S.) has been showcased prominently in the World Baseball Classic, an international event that, with 1.3 million attendees, saw its highest ever attendance in March during the 2023 iteration of the event.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThe move to add cricket comes amid growing desire to tap into the Indian market, where cricket is the most popular sport. Broadcast rights to the Olympics in India are reportedly worth $20 million for 2024 in Paris, but the Guardian reports, citing unnamed experts, that figure could be as high as around $180 million in 2028 now that cricket will be played.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nNBC Livestreaming Every Event From 2024 Paris Olympics On Peacock (Forbes)\n\nRussians And Belarusians Can Participate At 2024 Paralympics As Neutral Athletes (Forbes)\n\nNike Signs 5-Year Deal With USA Gymnastics As Simone Biles Returns Ahead Of 2024 Olympics (Forbes)\n\n2024 Olympics: Russia And Belarus Won't Be Invited To Participate — But Athletes Can Still Compete (Forbes)"

Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Kobe Bryant in Basketball, Michael Phelps (the player with the highest number of Olympic Gold medal) in swimming, and Tiger Woods in Golf and Tom Brady in American Football, all have dominated their respective sports by miles. The reason to this is the massive sporting industry the United States is and the sporting league system that exists there. The National Basketball League (NBA), the Major League Soccer (MLS) for Football, The National Football League (NFL) are some of the biggest sporting leagues in the world in terms of revenue they generate. But in a country like the USA, where sports is a major part of their economy and culture, we need to ask the question of Why has cricket, the second biggest sport in the world not a big sport in the country and how is it growing in the nation.\n\nCredit: Olympics\n\nAlso Read: Football vs Cricket\n\nIn this article by ZAP, we will decode this reason and know more about the Major League Cricket T20 (MLC T20), America’s first T20 Cricket League.\n\nWhat is the Major League Cricket (MLC)?\n\nThe sporting environment in the United States has been undergoing a dramatic change in the last few years. While sports like Basketball, American Football, Golf and Hockey have dominated the stage for many years, there has been a shift in sporting paradigm in the country. As a lot of people from the subcontinent live in the States, there’s a clear cult following of cricket in the country. Also, Virat Kohli is one of the biggest sportsman in the world, the third most followed sportsman on Instagram, has created a following in the US too. And finally, the rise of cricket and the T20 format, the most entertaining cricket format throughout the world, too has had a huge impact on this shift. Club this all together, and you get a new age T20 Cricket League, the Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nAlso Read: How to play Cricket Like a Pro | Cricket Rules\n\nCredit: AugustMan\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) is a new professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in the United States. This professional league is ushering in a new era for cricket in America and is backed by some of the biggest names in the sport, including some team owners of the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nMajor Cricket League History:\n\nPrior attempts to create T20 cricket leagues in the United States, such as Pro Cricket in 2004(just a single season) and the American Premier League (no seasons played) proved to be unproductive and very short lived, but laid the groundwork for Major League Cricket in the country.\n\nWith important partners including The Times Group and Willow TV founders, American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) was able to acquire a $1 billion investment for the league in 2019. This was a significant step towards materialization of the idea of the league. After receiving financing from Indian Premier League giants Kolkata Knight Riders. A proper youth league system and development programmes were set up to create a growing cricketing infrastructure.\n\nThe league's original launch was postponed until 2023 as a result of COVID-19 and stadium construction delays. MLC raised $120 million in fundraising in 2022 from well-known investors like Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft.\n\nThe MLC revealed plans in November 2022 for its first season, which would take place in July 2023 and include six franchises in a round-robin style. Despite early doubts about the league's legitimacy, the player draft was held in March 2023, and on April 13, 2023, the International Cricket Council (ICC) formally approved the league, enabling it to start operations.\n\nMajor League Cricket Teams and Owners:\n\nThe MLC Tournament 2023 started with 6 teams with the ACE managing all teams, but they were owned by the people and companies that had invested in the league. The Los Angeles Knight Riders were owned by KKR owners Knight Riders Group, MI New York is owned by Mumbai Indians owner Indiawin Sports, Seattle Orcas are owned by Delhi Capitals owners GMR Group and Microsoft CEO and Texas Super Kings is owned by the Chennai Super Kings owners along with Anurag Jain and Ross Perot Jr.\n\nTwo other teams San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom are owned by other owners.\n\nCredit: The Times of India\n\nTeam\n\nOwners\n\nCaptain\n\nCoach\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nKnight Riders Group\n\nSunil Narine\n\nPhil Simmons\n\nMI New York\n\nIndiawin Sports\n\nKieron Pollard\n\nRobin Peterson\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nAnand Rajaraman, Venky Harinarayan\n\nAaron Finch\n\nShane Watson\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nGMR Group, Satya Nadella\n\nWayne Parnell\n\nPravin Amre\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nChennai Super Kings, Anurag Jain, Ross Perot Jr.\n\nFaf du Plessis\n\nStephen Fleming\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSanjay Govil\n\nMoises Henriques\n\nGreg Shipperd\n\nMajor League Cricket Teams and Squads:\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nMI New York\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSunil Narine (c)\n\nKieron Pollard (c)\n\nAaron Finch (c)\n\nWayne Parnell (c)\n\nFaf du Plessis (c)\n\nMoises Henriques (c)\n\nAli Khan\n\nSteven Taylor\n\nCorey Anderson\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nRusty Theron\n\nAndries Gous\n\nUnmukt Chand\n\nHammad Azam\n\nLiam Plunkett\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nJaskaran Malhotra (wk)\n\nEhsan Adil\n\nTajinder Singh\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nLahiru Milantha\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nCorne Dry\n\nMonank Patel (wk)\n\nCarmi Le Roux\n\nAaron Jones\n\nSami Aslam\n\nSaad Ali\n\nAli Sheikh\n\nSarabjit Ladda\n\nBrody Couch\n\nNauman Anwar\n\nCameron Stevenson\n\nDane Piedt\n\nSaif Badar\n\nShayan Jahangir (wk)\n\nDavid White\n\nPhani Simhadri\n\nCody Chetty\n\nSujith Gowda\n\nShadley van Schalkwyk\n\nKyle Phillip\n\nSmit Patel (wk)\n\nAngelo Perera\n\nZia Shahzad\n\nJustin Dill\n\nBhaskar Yadram\n\nSaideep Ganesh\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nMatthew Tromp\n\nSaiteja Mukkamalla\n\nAkhilesh Bodugum\n\nAndre Russell\n\nTrent Boult\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nMitchell Marsh\n\nDevon Conway\n\nWanindu Hasaranga\n\nJason Roy\n\nRashid Khan\n\nLungi Ngidi\n\nQuinton de Kock (wk)\n\nMitchell Santner\n\nAnrich Nortje\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nTim David\n\nMatthew Wade (wk)\n\nDasun Shanaka\n\nDaniel Sams\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nMartin Guptill\n\nDewald Brevis\n\nQais Ahmad\n\nSikandar Raza\n\nDavid Miller\n\nGlenn Phillips\n\nAdam Zampa\n\nDavid Wiese\n\nFinn Allen\n\nAndrew Tye\n\nGerald Coetzee\n\nAdam Milne\n\nRilee Rossouw\n\nKagiso Rabada\n\nMackenzie Harvey\n\nHeinrich Klaasen\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nJosh Philippe\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nIzharulhaq Naveed\n\nAmbati Rayudu\n\nBen Dwarshuis\n\nGajanand Singh\n\nJason Behrendorff\n\nShadab Khan\n\nDwaine Pretorius\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nAkeal Hosein\n\nJasdeep Singh\n\nAmila Aponso\n\nNisarg Patel\n\nImran Tahir\n\nUsman Rafiq\n\nTristan Stubbs\n\nShimron Hetmyer\n\nTanveer Sangha\n\nImad Wasim\n\nMatthew Short\n\nReason For Major League Cricket (MLC) Tournament Success:\n\nCredit: The Indian Express\n\nExceeding All Expectations:\n\nBaseball was the only sport similar to cricket in America, but had a lot of differences.

This financial backing and strong incentives played a crucial role in making the league a success.\n\nMassive Fan Turnout:\n\nThe tournament witnessed massive fan turnouts, with over 70,000 fans attending matches played in two venues, Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.

He pulled the next ball over mid wicket to bring some momentum to the innings.\n\nDavid Wiese also found himself at the receiving end of Phillips’ wrath. Phillips flicked the first ball of the next over towards deep square leg, and hit a powerful six to move on to 45 off 33 balls.\n\nHe was out two balls later, as Washington posted 160-6, a target MI New York easily chased down with eight wickets and 27 balls in hand.\n\nWatch the shots by Glenn Phillips here:"

Cricket, baby,\" Samnani said.\n\n\"It’s a historic day for cricket in America and cricket in Texas,\" said Tom Dunmore, with Major League Cricket. \"These are the world’s best players coming here to the Dallas area to play professional cricket.\"\n\nWhat is this global sport?\n\n\"It’s like baseball with 10 times the energy and action, which sounds funny because people think cricket might be a slow game, but the ball is actually in play a lot more,\" Dunmore said.\n\n\"I would say within an hour you’ll know what’s going on,\" Samnami said.\n\nSome fans came from out of town, and one fan attended from South Africa.\n\nMajor League Cricket hopes to establish a cricket culture in North Texas.\n\nThursday’s match to a crowd of thousands is just the beginning.\n\nThe teams will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\n\nMost of the matches will be held in Grand Prairie, with some others played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nGrand Prairie Mayor Ron Jensen says he's heard from people across the region and from other countries who are interested in the sport.\n\nJensen says there are more than 400,000 North Texans who subscribe to WILLOW, a TV channel dedicated to 24/7 cricket coverage. He says the best way to enjoy the sport is to get out and watch it.\n\n\"It's really not that complicated once you get out and watch a game,\" said Jensen. \"It's very simple, high-scoring, there's going to be a lot of runs scored, so it is very exciting.\"\n\n\"Think of it as a baseball game, with ten times what happens in a baseball game,\" said Srinivasan."

        "body": "Organisers have held talks with PCB over possibility of granting NOCs\n\nA handful of Pakistan players are waiting to hear if they will be permitted to play in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in the United States in July.\n\nImad Wasim and Azam Khan - who do not hold central contracts with the PCB - have agreed deals in principle to play for Seattle Orcas, whose backers include GMR Group, the co-owners of Delhi Capitals.\n\nTwo other players, who are national team regulars in both white-ball formats and are centrally contracted, have also been in talks with another franchise but are waiting to hear from the PCB whether they will be granted No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) to play in the tournament.\n\nESPNcricinfo understands that MLC's organisers have been in talks with the PCB in recent weeks to discuss the potential participation of Pakistan players. The PCB are thought to be evaluating the league and exploring the specific terms and conditions upon which NOCs may be granted. There are some suggestions that the PCB could ask for a fee in the region of USD$25,000 in exchange for an NOC. There is some anxiety from league organisers as to whether Pakistan players will be granted visas, though that is not believed to be a serious obstacle.\n\nRelated\n\nMLC wants more England cricketers, but not to 'start a war with anyone'\n\nDu Plessis, Conway, Santner, Rayudu reunite with coach Fleming at Texas Super Kings\n\nMLC gets official ICC sanction ahead of July launch this year\n\nRoy agrees termination of ECB incremental contract to play in MLC\n\nA more pressing obstacle to their potential participation will be the nature and, indeed, fate of Pakistan's July commitment in Sri Lanka. That series is currently a two-Test World Test Championship series which overlaps with MLC - the league takes place from July 13-30 at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. There is speculation that series may turn into an ODI series as preparation for the World Cup. If so the two centrally contracted players will likely not be able to play in the US as they would be required to appear for Pakistan.\n\nAny appearance by Pakistani players would be significant because they have missed out on the two other big leagues launched in the UAE and South Africa, both with significant IPL franchise ownership. The ostensible reason for their absence from the ILT20 and the SA20 was because of a busy international home season for their top players. But there were also suggestions at the time that IPL franchise owners were reluctant to pick Pakistani players because of strained political ties between India and Pakistan - Pakistani players have not featured in the IPL since the inaugural season.\n\nFour of the six MLC franchises have investors who own or co-own IPL teams, while Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales have stakes in the other two.\n\nEach franchise has a salary cap of $1.15 million and several leading international players - including Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje - have signed deals worth up to $175,000.\n\nEach team will only play five group games in the inaugural season, though MLC is likely to expand in future years.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98"

A sea of yellow filled Grand Prairie Stadium, whistling and cheering for the Dallas area’s newest sports team, the Texas Super Kings.\n\nFans supporting the local team didn’t leave disappointed, either. The Super Kings put on a dominant display, defeating the Los Angeles Knight Riders 181-112.\n\nHip-hop music blared through the stadium speakers, and cheers grew louder as a countdown appeared on the scoreboard, counting down to the first ball of the inaugural MLC season.\n\n“This is cricket’s American dream,” was said on the opening of the TV broadcast.\n\nSince the start of the Indian Premier League in 2008, professional cricket has become a lucrative business across the world. However, that success abroad never translated in the U.S.\n\nLeagues such as the American Premier League and Pro Cricket started in the U.S., but could never come near the success of the sport abroad.\n\nMLC hopes to change that, and Thursday night was the first step.

Smoke, fireworks and drums rang out with every big hit, generating consistent excitement throughout the night.\n\nEven for the most casual fan, the match delivered exciting moments from the first ball. The Super Kings piled on 181 runs in the first innings, as Lahiru Milantha hit the first six. Ten more followed as the ball flew out of the park in the Texas humidity. After an innings of runs and sixes, the excitement shifted to an innings of wickets when the Knight Riders were up to bat. They were unable to chase the Super Kings’ score, and after 10 of the 11 Knight Riders players were out, the match was over.\n\nChants of “T-S-K” rang out as the fans exited the stadium.\n\nIt was the perfect platform to introduce a sport that has garnered hundreds of millions of views across the world to an American audience that felt long overdue for a product at the highest level. International stars such as Du Plessis and Devin Conway featured for the Super Kings, giving many hardcore D-FW cricket fans a chance to see their favorite players for the first time.\n\nThe crowd was a mix of die-hard cricket fans and Dallas-area sports fans looking for a new type of entertainment. Among the Super Kings jerseys, India jerseys and various jerseys representing teams in the Indian Premier League, were a number of fans wearing Rangers, Cowboys and other Texas-themed sports attire.\n\nWhile much of MLC’s promotion targeted the hardcore fans, the mix that was present on opening night symbolized the opportunity on which the league is looking to capitalize.\n\nRelated:Major League Cricket in Dallas: Season dates, teams, rules and more\n\n“Just very excited to see what is gonna pan out over the next couple years,” Du Plessis said. “I think its got a great future.”\n\nThe opening night atmosphere laid the foundation, and the hype is expected to continue. Matches on Saturday and Monday are already sold out, according to a league spokesperson, signaling a successful start to the league’s inaugural season.\n\nMatches will continue throughout July and will stay in Grand Prairie for the rest of the opening weekend. The action will then move to Church Street Park in Morrisville, N.C., returning to Grand Prairie for playoffs starting July 27."

        "body": "After years of intrigue and anticipation, and of course speedbumps that has been the norm for a long troubled sport in a goldmine of a location, Major League Cricket was spectacularly unveiled in Houston on Sunday.\n\nWith a pool of overseas stars limited - due to international commitments and India's contracted players unable to play beyond their homegrown Indian Premier League - the MLC did well to recruit several well-known players still at their peak.\n\nSalary caps were reportedly around $1 million per team with top players set to receive similar remuneration per game to cashed-up start-up leagues in the UAE UAE and South Africa.\n\nAlso drafted were a host of expat players, who are flying the flag for a pro cricket league hoped to finally fuel the rise of cricket in the world's biggest market. While born and bred players were perhaps predictably outnumbered, MLC is hoped to spark interest in the younger generations amid such fierce competition for eyeballs.\n\nPrevious attempts at launching a pro league proved unsuccessful, but through such dedication to legitimizing the U.S. - with the sport's governing body identifying it as the No.1 target growth destination - there has been serious investment into MLC.\n\nMLC has secured more than $40 million in funding and over $100 million in “handshakes” with private investors including tech giants Microsoft MSFT .\n\nAround the gaudy inaugural draft, the six franchises were unveiled ahead of the 18-day tournament starting in July. Three of them are owned by franchises from the IPL, cricket's biggest and most lucrative tournament.\n\nThus their names are strikingly familar: Texas Super Kings (Chennai Super Kings), Los Angeles Knight Riders (Kolkata Knight Riders) and MI New York (Mumbai Indians).\n\nIt is obviously quite a deep imprint from the IPL, whose franchises are keen to expand beyond India and become global brands. Several of the them have already planted a stake in other T20 tournaments, but MLC has to be wary it doesn't become labelled as merely an IPL 'satellite' like some of those competitions.\n\nThere is obvious cache for MLC to be business partners with these franchises but it has led to cynicism from some quarters over the tournament's motivations and whether it will actually spur development of cricket at the grassroots level, where the sport's long-term success in the U.S. lies.\n\nFor the IPL, which is starting its 16th edition soon and essentially forces a shut down of international cricket in April and May, it is a chance to further strengthen its multi-billion dollar empire through tentacles into the highly coveted American sports landscape.\n\nIndustry sources say that the IPL's ultimate goal is to become something like the NBA and essentially have seasons that run for more than half a year. To do that it would need international players to start committing essentially full-time to their franchises.\n\nAs IPL franchises expand into different leagues, there is the chance for contracted players to play year-round including in the fledgling MLC.\n\nIf the IPL's ever burgeoning media rights deal keeps exploding, like the NBA, then there will be more cash to throw at cricket's stars who might just be tempted to forgo allegiances to their country.\n\nThat's still all very much down the track, but the eagerness of those IPL franchises to be involved in MLC underlines long-held sentiment over cricket in America.\n\nThere is a lot of money to be made."

The historic night at the Grand Prairie Stadium will see Texas Super Kings rubbing shoulders with Los Angeles Knight Riders in the opener.\n\n(Photo credit: @MLCricket Twitter)\n\nNEW DELHI: In its biggest attempt ever to crack the American market, the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket , backed by Indian Premier League heavyweight franchises, kicks off in Texas on Wednesday.\n\nThe historic night at the Grand Prairie Stadium will see Texas Super Kings rubbing shoulders with Los Angeles Knight Riders in the opener.\n\nWith plenty of money and expertise the league, unlike prior attempts, the MLC has the backing of Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings among others with world's biggest cricketing superstars featuring in the competition.\n\nAlong with the financial muscle and television deals, MLC has also been sanctioned by USA Cricket and the International Cricket Council -- rubber stamps that have been absent from short-lived private ventures in the past.\n\nLike the IPL, the league will play the shortest and most explosive version of cricket, Twenty20, and has recruited some experienced international players.\n\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\n\nWhile cricket has long been played at a recreational level in the USA -- the first-ever international game being between the USA and Canada at New York in 1844 -- there remains a shortage of facilities for the sport in a country where baseball is beloved.\n\nA former baseball park in North Texas, Grand Prairie Stadium, has been transformed into a cricket-specific venue and will be the site of the opener when the Texas Super Kings face the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\n\nWhile organizers expect good levels of support from fans with family backgrounds in cricket-loving countries, they aim to gradually win over the broader American public.\n\n\"The goal is to grow the game of cricket and expose the sport in the USA,\" tournament director Justin Geale, told AFP.\n\n\"We've got some of the best players in the world that can actually represent the product, do it justice. So it's going to be a good quality game of cricket that gives us the best chance to show existing fans and new fans the game.\n\n\"We've got as far as anyone ever has. So after all the false starts, I think it's finally here.\"\n\nPart of the groundwork that MLC did was been the creation of Minor League Cricket, a 26-team competition which began in 2021 to spark domestic player development.\n\nThe teams will feature a maximum of six foreign players and a minimum of five domestic players and Geale says developing a talent pool for the USA national team is a big part of the mission.\n\n\"Building talent here domestically is one of our big pillars for sustainability,\" he said.\n\nIt will be a challenge for coaches and captains to manage teams with experienced international players alongside emerging domestic players but South African Robin Peterson, head coach of the Mumbai Indians-backed MI New York team, says it will work.\n\n\"In my experience, I found that the local boys tend to learn quite a bit playing alongside these superstars,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I've seen it firsthand in the SA20 and even if you look at the growth and trajectory of the Indian cricket since the inception of the IPL, it has just been amazing the amount of talent that they're producing.\n\n\"I see the league here playing a similar role for USA cricket.\"\n\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\n\nPeterson is optimistic that T20, much more than longer forms of the game, has the ingredients to win eyeballs in the American market.\n\n\"It's becoming more entertainment,\" he said. \"It speaks to the American sporting psyche where the players are a lot more physical, fitter, stronger, hit the ball further.\n\n\"It's an exciting project. I think it's about time people start taking cricket seriously in America.\"\n\n(With inputs from AFP)\n\nYou can book your MLC tickets here\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"

        "title": "The Owner of DC’s New Major League Cricket Team Is an Evangelist for the Sport",
        "date": "Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "DC’s newest professional sports team, the Washington Freedom, will make its Major League Cricket debut on Friday with a match against Seattle in Texas.\n\nThe first pro cricket league in the US, MLC has four other teams—Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco—and will play its 2023 season matches at Dallas’ home stadium and at a cricket ground in North Carolina. By 2025, however, the Freedom hope to play home matches in the area at a dual-use baseball/cricket stadium built in partnership with George Mason University.\n\nCricket is estimated to be the second-most popular sport in the world behind soccer, but its appeal is concentrated in South Asia, the Caribbean, South Africa, and Oceania. In the US, the Freedom and MLC initially will be counting on fan interest from South Asian and West Indian immigrant communities that already have flourishing amateur leagues—but future growth will come from building a broader base of support.\n\nTo better understand how the Freedom came to be—and where American cricket is heading—Washingtonian spoke with team owner Sanjay Govil, an IT executive from Rockville and lifelong cricket enthusiast:\n\nTell us a bit about your background. Did you grow up playing cricket?\n\nI was born in Canada, where my father was doing his doctorate, and then we moved back to India.. I grew up playing cricket, like any other Indian. If the total population of India is 1.4 billion, I would say 1.4 billion people either play or follow cricket. So it’s like a religion there, it’s in everybody’s blood, and it’s a national pastime.\n\nI moved to Alabama in my senior year of high school and went to Auburn University. I used to play in Auburn, but obviously there was no mechanism at that time to watch matches. So there was a void for a few years when there was no cricket for me. Then I moved to upstate New York to work for IBM. I did my master’s at Syracuse again and played for the Syracuse cricket team. At that time there was no real league, so we had created our own league in upstate New York. Our captain was Raj Subramaniam, who is now the CEO of FedEx— I just met him again at the Biden state dinner with Prime Minister Modi. I moved to Maryland in ‘91 and have called that my home since then.\n\nIs there a big amateur cricket community in this area?\n\nWe have so many leagues in every county: Loudoun County, Fairfax County, Montgomery County, Howard County, PG County, and Baltimore County. We have fields all over. We have our Infinite Eagles team, which plays the Maryland Cricket Premier League, and we are the most successful in terms of winning championships. So I’m very proud of that. I’m a U.S. citizen, proud to be an American, but at the same time, my love for cricket has always been there.\n\nPeople like us, as we’ve grown, our children have grown, and the amount of kids who are playing cricket now at different academies across the United States is mind boggling. We have parents who literally take their kids at 7 AM and come back at 4 PM for cricket. There’s so much money in cricket now, just like soccer, just like the NFL and so on, that they see this as an avenue where people can play in leagues across the world from the Indian Premier League to Major League Cricket in America, and the Big Bash in Australia. So that’s going to be huge.\n\nSo cricket is one of the most popular sports worldwide, and many Americans, especially South Asians, are die-hard fans. But there are also a lot of Americans who don’t know how it’s played. Are you thinking about ways to build a stronger fanbase in DC?\n\nMy goal is to make this an American sport. The goal here is not just South Asians, they’re already in it, right? So a lot of my effort is going to being an evangelist for this sport among people who are not exposed to cricket. The good news is that they are already being exposed to cricket because, you know, ESPN occasionally has scores. The second thing that’s a very interesting fact is that cricket used to be played in the US until the 1800s.\n\nBut the goal is definitely to evangelize the sport in the US. We’ll start to create a lot of social media stuff on how cricket is played, just to bring awareness. We fully understand this is going to be a multi-year cycle. The beauty about this is that this is a three-hour game and you go there and just bang, bang, bang. It is run after run after run, and you go there and have beer, burgers and hot dogs and you know, all the stuff we love here. So it’s a combination of being at a party and enjoying a game.\n\nMajor League Baseball has been trying to pick up the pace of its games. Is cricket a faster paced game?\n\nI think it’s as fast-paced as the NFL and the NBA, and there is no comparison between baseball and cricket in terms of pace. I mean, it’s nonstop action. The only time there’s no action is when the bowler is coming in to bowl, but there’s action even then, because there’s so much anticipation. And every ball counts. So it’s a very intense game, very fast paced, and you really get into it when you’re supporting your team.\n\nThis first season lasts less than a month, and all the games take place in Texas and North Carolina, where stadiums already exist. When will DC get its own cricket stadium?\n\nThe goal is to have your stadiums up and running as soon as possible. Our goal is 2025, and as every city has its own stadium, we’re obviously going to have matches in each stadium. So the limiting factor is the lack of infrastructure right now. We’re very fortunate that we teamed up with George Mason University to build a stadium, which is going to be a combo of baseball and a cricket field, the first in the United States of America, and it’s going to be a great blueprint for all universities and colleges. And next to us—I cannot name the team—but there’s going to be another professional team coming next to us. They’re building their stadium there, and the concept is to build a whole township in that area. This is being built in the West campus [in Fairfax] because they have like 130 acres of land. So it’s going to be a great thing for the community and a great thing for Washington. The [T20] World Cup is slated to be hosted by a combination of the United States and West Indies next year. It’s already announced. That’s another big impetus for cricket. And then the Olympics 2028 is looking at adding cricket. If that happens, then it’s going to be a full court press on improving cricket in America."

There is a further South African flavour added to the TSK pot with former Dolphins duo Calvan Savage and Cody Chetty along with former Proteas and Warriors seam bowler Rusty Theron registered as local American players after relocating to the US a few years ago.\n\nTheron, 37, played 36 white-ball internationals for the Proteas, while also having IPL experience with the Deccan Chargers, Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab.\n\nThe LA Knight Riders, meanwhile, will feature Proteas top-order batter Rilee Rossouw along with West Indian superstar Andre Russell. Former Free State duo Shadley van Schalkwyk and Corne Dry also form part of the Knight Riders squad as “localised” Americans.\n\nThe four remaining teams MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom will also have a large South African presence.\n\nProteas superstar Kagiso Rabada along with wunderkid Dewald Brevis will join up at MI New York again, while the Seattle Orcas will be led by Proteas all-rounder Wayne Parnell.\n\nParnell will be hoping his Proteas teammate Quinton de Kock strikes some form at the top of the order to fire up the Orcas’ batting unit. Gauteng teenager Matthew Tromp is also part of the Orcas’ squad.\n\nLungi Ngidi will be looking forward to some much-needed gametime with the San Francisco Unicorns after performing drinks duties throughout the IPL. He’s joined by “locals” left-arm seamer Carmi le Roux, who played for the Nelson Mandela Super Giants in the Mzansi Super League, and former Warriors batter David White.\n\nProteas top guns Anrich Nortje and Marco will form a fearsome new-ball duo at Washington Freedom where they will link up with former Proteas and Western Province off-spinner Dane Piedt and SA U19 all-rounder Justin Dill. Piedt’s last of his nine Test matches was against India in Ranchi in 2019."

        "date": "Sat Apr  1 08:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Last month, the draft for the inaugural Major League Cricket campaign took place at Houston's iconic space centre.\n\nIt feels surreal writing those words, to be honest, but there wasn’t a more fitting venue to launch this ambitious, exciting enterprise. Two decades after T20 cricket burst onto the scene, Major League Cricket will become the first professional franchise tournament to be established across the pond.\n\nThe United States isn’t a country renowned for its love of cricket, but the new competition will have a profound impact on the sport's long and ever-changing anatomy if it's successful.\n\nThat is a big if. As Robbie Williams and other British musicians will tell you, cracking the American market is no easy feat. Yet the architects of Major League Cricket - including former England bowler and World Cup winner Liam Plunkett - are confident of success.\n\n\"I’m very excited… I think it's got massive potential,\" Plunkett tells Mirror Sport. \"I think we need to do it our way. We keep the [T20] cricket structure the same… but then we build up around that as the Americans would. You put the glitter on it; you have all the fireworks.\"\n\nBuilding Major League Cricket\n\nCricket is not a new phenomenon in the United States. The sport was brought across the pond by the British and remained popular after the country gained independence in the late 18th century.\n\nWhat's your opinion on Major League Cricket? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nIn fact, cricket's first ever international match was contested between the United States and Canada in 1844. It is believed up to 20,000 people attended St George's Cricket Club in New York to watch the first day's play, with Canada winning the two-innings match by 23 runs.\n\nEventually, though, baseball became America's sport with a stick, and cricket's popularity waned. There have been attempts to establish a professional game in the United States before, but to no avail. Yet confidence has been renewed for a variety of reasons.\n\nMajor League Cricket's architects have developed the infrastructure for a franchise tournament to flourish, while the South Asian American population has grown to five million.\n\nJustin Geale, Major League Cricket’s tournament director, explains, \"Cricket is played here, across the country, in great numbers. There are many leagues; it's been tried a couple of times to do it to this scale.\n\n\"Infrastructure is the biggest challenge we have... that's been a stumbling block in holding back the game from growing. That's been a big focus of ours during the last three years - to build an infrastructure so we can get more of elite, high-performance cricket happening.\"\n\nPlunkett adds, \"That’s why we’re here - for cricket. A lot of hard work has been going on behind the scenes. A lot of stuff is out on socials and people can see that hard work.\"\n\nMinor League Cricket, a development tournament first played in 2021, has helped build momentum and will continue to act as a feeder league for Major League Cricket.\n\n\"We've spent three years building out of Minor League Cricket, so we've now got that pathway,\" notes Geale. \"I guess it's the unsexy stuff that no one's seen or heard about during the last few years; what we've had to do to get to these announcements for Major League Cricket, which is a lot more exciting and a bit more glitz and glamour.\"\n\nIPL influence\n\nThe road to Major League Cricket started in 2019, when USA Cricket - the sport's new governing body - brought on American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) as investors.\n\nAn initial $120million of funding was secured, with Indian Premier League (IPL) chiefs investing in four of the franchises: Los Angeles Knight Riders (parent club, Kolkata Knight Riders), MI New York (Mumbai Indians), Texas Super Kings (Chennai Super Kings) and Seattle Orcas (Delhi Capitals). The other Major League Cricket teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom.\n\nThat experience and wealth is crucial to the project's success. On a per-game basis, the IPL is the world’s second most valuable sporting competition after the NFL, which means its broadcasting rights are more lucrative than English football’s Premier League.\n\n\"Why now?\" Geale asks. \"I think ACE, which is our parent company in Major League Cricket, has the right mix of high-network investors who are very smart businesspeople - savvy businesspeople - in their own right. We pair them with some IPL teams... to get that mix of business and sport.\n\n\"America doesn't know it needs cricket, but if you look at something like baseball - and I love baseball - but it can be pretty slow. So, we're looking at T20 - about the same duration [as baseball]; high scoring; lots of sixes... While we have an existing cricket market here of fans… if we can drag some new people to the sport, there's such a big opportunity.\n\n\"It's the second largest sport in the world - it's the largest sports media market in the world - and if we can make it work, I think it's going to be now. If not now, when?\"\n\nAttracting the stars\n\nAnother boost for Major League Cricket is the presence of Plunkett and former New Zealand international Corey Anderson, who have become ambassadors for the new competition. Plunkett is also Major League Cricket’s national development coach.\n\n\"Liam is crucial to us,\" explains Geale. \"You look at someone like Liam, who's done it all for his country at the highest level. Someone like Corey Anderson, who is really experienced. They've both married American wives, so they've set up their lives here.\n\n\"It's so important to have cricket people around. When I got here, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of cricket - but I was really shocked by the [lack of] infrastructure.\n\n\"What we really lacked, though, was that cricket experience and knowledge, so having someone like Liam... he's still a great player and I can tell you he's absolutely steaming in at the moment! He's pumped to play Major League Cricket.\n\n\"But the experience in terms of coaching - not just our high-performance guys, but just new people to the sport. He's an ambassador, as well. The more guys we drag like that, who are probably towards the end of their playing career, I think he [Plunkett] wouldn't mind me saying that... they've got so much to add from a coaching aspect.\"\n\nMajor League Cricket has also attracted some huge international stars, with the likes of Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Marsh, Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje all signing up during the inaugural draft.\n\nMore superstars are expected to join before the tournament gets underway, although Geale has dismissed rumours of England batter Jason Roy being handed a £300,000 contract. He laughs, \"A little bit inflated... a bit of fake news there, as we say in the USA!\"\n\nBut the tournament chief admits, \"We really will be able to get a lot of the top players - there's a real curiosity about coming to play here. I think our salary cap is going to be pretty competitive, compared to some of the other leagues at the moment.\n\n\"The idea to come and play cricket in a new market, like the US. To spend two or three weeks here and bring the golf clubs and bring your family and actually play some good level cricket. But also, it's a different experience for players.\n\n\"To date, we haven't had any trouble attracting some of these top guys.\"\n\nPlunkett adds, \"I still want to test myself against the best players in the world but also help promote the league. We want the best stars - the best players in the world - to come across and see that Major League Cricket is taking this seriously.\n\n\"We want it to be here for a long time. We're not just a gimmick - we want it to be a successful franchise league with great competition. Of course, I want the best players to come from all over the world.\"\n\nEnglish worries\n\nAlthough Major League Cricket is an exciting venture, there are concerns in England. The inaugural tournament takes place between July 13 and July 30 - just before the peak of the English season in August.\n\nIt's squeezed in between the Vitality Blast and The Hundred - England's premier T20 tournaments - and will attract the attention of English white-ball specialists who are not restricted by an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) contract. Major League Cricket will clash with the Ashes, which has been brought forward to June and July to make way for The Hundred.\n\nCrucially, though, three County Championship games will take place during July. A lot of county players will be tempted to miss those fixtures and head to Dallas, with Major League Cricket offering \"competitive\" salaries. It's fair to say the counties are not doing the same.\n\nThere is a real concern that Major League Cricket will persuade more young players to pursue white-ball only careers. Will Smeed, one of England's most talented young batters, said goodbye to red-ball cricket aged 21 last year.\n\nPacking in the long slog of four-day cricket for a pulsating whack in front of a capacity crowd looks increasingly more appealing. As former England captain Michael Atherton wrote in his column for The Times, \"English cricket will be watching nervously.\"\n\nGeale and Plunkett, though, do not see Major League Cricket as a rival to the English game.\n\nGeale insists, \"We’re certainly not here to disrupt or take on world cricket - I'm not going to say that. It's the opposite summer to a lot of the down under countries, so I think we've got a nice little slot. I think they can coexist, there's enough players of good quality going around in the world at the moment.\"\n\nPlunkett adds, \"It's a unique situation because I don't want to dilute English cricket, but I also want to build-up Major League Cricket. So, that [question] is for the powers that be, I'm afraid!\"\n\nYet Major League Cricket is hoping to attract some of England's international stars, many of whom won the 2019 World Cup alongside Plunkett. The bowler admits, \"I'd love it to work out with England because obviously I've got a lot of friends there, and the England team is the best white-ball team in the world.\"\n\nGeale explains, \"Realistically, it's unlikely we're going to get red-ball, centrally-contracted ECB players - and that's fine. Their priority needs to be playing for their country.\n\n\"Having said that, I think our window... will probably be attractive to some of the white-ball guys. We have had a few of the white-ball guys reach out, and it'll be lovely to have a couple of guys from England because I think we are covered from Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa, West Indies... we're going to have players from everywhere.\n\n\"It'll be nice to have some English guys, obviously, but there's a process and the guys need to look at their country of origin first of all and make sure they're happy there [with their schedules]. Ideally, we'd love to have the guys come out - I think there's a world where they can do both, to be honest.\"\n\nWorld Cup and beyond\n\nGeale is hoping Major League Cricket can play an important role in the upcoming T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the United States. The event will take place next June, but the International Cricket Council (ICC) are yet to confirm which venues will be used.\n\nMost of the fixtures for the inaugural Major League Cricket campaign will take place at the Grand Prairie Stadium, a former ballpark which is being converted into a cricket ground. The revamped arena will hold 7,000 spectators and is expandable to 15,000. It would be a huge boost for Major League Cricket's spiritual home to play a part in next year's World Cup.\n\nGeale says, \"We'd love our stadium in Dallas to host some matches, and I'm pretty confident it will. We're working really closely with the ICC on that. I think that [competition] and another Major League Cricket season - there's a lot of talk of cricket in the 2028 LA Olympics. You look at those milestones, and that's the progression for the sport [and it's] a really strong one.\n\n\"We're incredibly excited about the World Cup. I think it also gives us exposure to a lot of other nations - teams will need somewhere to prepare, they'll come out. They'll be opportunities for the USA national team to play warm-up matches; to show our venues.\n\n\"Where I'm in Morrisville now, there's no reason why this wouldn't be a great place for a team to come and spend a couple of weeks and prepare. There's going to be great practice wickets; there's great hotels around. All that sort of stuff really adds to our infrastructure and ability to host international touring teams, which ultimately we'd love to do more of.\n\n\"There's no reason once we have the stadiums and people are really embracing the sport, that more tournaments can't be held in the US.\"\n\nRight now, the future is bright for Major League Cricket. Not everyone will be a fan of it, particularly traditionalists in England, but the new competition’s architects are sitting on a fortune.\n\nAll the ingredients are there for franchise cricket to explode in the United States, yet they still have to get this right. They do not want Major League Cricket to be another failed attempt to crack the American market.\n\nUltimately, only time will tell whether Major League Cricket has lift off… or a problem."

        "body": "8.5 to MJ Santner , Wickets continue to tumble! Dug into the pitch and it kicks off the deck, lures him to go for the big shot and he goes for the pull, top edge fountained up as keeper settles underneath and hangs onto it brilliantly. His ebullience only lasts for five deliveries. Swung big but didn't control his bat and de Kock had plenty of time to track the ball which safely nestles in his glove. Third umpire checked if it was a no ball, well his foot landed before sliding past the popping crease so it's a legitimate delivery. 48 / 6\n\n5.2 to C Chetty , Another one bites the dust! TSK innings in absolute disarray; third wicket down! Round the wicket, hits the deck hard and gets the ball to bounce steeply off the deck, it was a cutter. He was not in a good position to play the paddle and ends up giving a easy catch to Imad Wasim at short fine who reverse cups it, a nifty catch. 40 / 3\n\n7.1 to DA Miller , Gottim with a beauty! Parnell is on fire! Beautiful seam position, pitches on a length and jags back just enough to beat his drive; pings the top of off and the bails are flying everywhere. Incision! This is turning out to be a great bowling spell, captain leading from the front. 45 / 4\n\n7.4 to Milind Kumar , Are you kidding me? Nauman Anwar plucks a stunning catch out of thin air at square leg but wait, the umpires want to take another look at it. This was pitched short and angled into the body, he went for the full-blooded pull but didn't get the elevation and wasn't really under-controlled. The catch looks okay to me on the replay and Aleem Dar agrees; OUT on the big screen and he has to go back into the hut! He was charging in from deep and dived forward to gobble it up. Kept his eyes on the ball and judged the catch impeccably. 46 / 5\n\n19.3 to DJ Bravo , That went miles up in the air and then into Harmeet's bucket hands. Back of the hand slower one and Bravo tries to muscle a pull but mistimes it.. 126 / 8\n\n19.4 to Zia-ul-Haq , Opens the face of the blade ever so slightly and tries to loft it over long-off, ball swirling in the air and Klaasen was circling around trying to keep track of the ball; takes a superb diving catch. 126 / 9"

        "body": "Watch: Casual running between the wickets cost Finn Allen his wicket in an MLC 2023 match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.\n\nDespite some tight bowling from Carmi le Roux (4-0-29-0) and Marcus Stoinis (4-0-28-0), the Seattle Orcas posted 177-4 in the fourth match of the 2023 MLC after Wayne Parnell won the toss and opted to bat. The big innings came from Heinrich Klaasen (53 in 31 balls).\n\nIn response, Finn Allen blocked the first ball he faced and edged the second, from Imad Wasim, before exploding in characteristic fashion.\n\nHe hit Imad for six. When Parnell replaced Imad for the third over, Allen went four, dot, six, four, four, four, racing to 28 off nine balls.\n\nMatthew Wade then flicked the first ball of the next over, from Cameron Gannon, for a run. At this point, San Francisco were 42-0 in 3.1 overs: they needed 136 in 101 balls with all their wickets in hand.\n\nBack on strike, Allen turned the ball towards mid-wicket and jogged for a single. Former Sri Lanka international Shehan Jayasuriya, playing as a local player in the US-based competition, threw the ball at the non-striker’s end.\n\nDespite the casual jog, Allen had his ground covered. He now tried to plunge his bat into the crease. He had timed it correctly, but his calculations were foiled by his bat, which got stuck in the turf.\n\nAs the bat fell from Allen’s hand, the ball hit the stumps, and the umpire ruled Allen run out.\n\nWade followed not too long afterwards, but Stoinis and captain Aaron Finch took San Francisco to 86-2. Then they perished in the space of three balls, and Seattle bowled out San Francisco for 142 as Gannon claimed 4-23. The only resistance came from Shadab Khan (37 in 23 balls).\n\nWatch Finn Allen get run out at the MLC:"

Rossouw departs after an enterprising knock of 41. Swung big but doesn't get enough power and elevation behind the shot.. 154 / 5\n\n18.3 to SP Narine , Looks to go over mid-off but doesn't connect well! Length ball on a tight off stump line, Pienaar moves across and almost shelled it as the ball popped out of his hands but he recovered well to hang onto it in the second attempt. Narine goes without troubling the scorers. 154 / 6\n\n3.2 to JJ Roy , Huge appeal for lbw and up goes the finger! Round the wicket, lands it on a length and it zings back to rap on his pads. A stunning delivery and right on money, does him for pace as well and traps him straight in front. That was just too good and he gets reward for some wonderful bowling. 11 / 1\n\n6.2 to NR Kumar , Fuller and outside off, he is playing away from his body, extends his hands out and carves it away to deep extra cover where Pienaar takes a comfortable catch down his throat. Just couldn't get underneath it on this occasion and there wasn't much power behind the shot. It was a slower delivery and he did well to keep it away from his range. 37 / 2\n\n6.5 to UBT Chand , Big shout for an lbw and the umpire raises the dreaded finger, good length and raps him on the pad as he tries to flick it away to the leg side, that looks plumb and he doesn't decide to take a second opinion. What an over it is turning out to be for Henriques!. 38 / 3\n\n19.1 to CA Dry , Holes out to long-on! High full-toss outside off, tries to clear the rope, didn't get all of it. Short tracks the ball from the bat, through the air, towards him and then into his hand. 166 / 7"

The match will take place in front of a sold-out crowd, according to MLC officials, who announced on Monday that opening-day tickets are gone. Then, this weekend the final four teams in the women's Volleyball Nations League (VNL) will take to the courts for matches and a medal ceremony at College Park Center in Arlington.\n\nMLC has been in the works for over a year, starting with renovation crews who turned the old Texas Airhogs baseball stadium in Grand Prairie into a professional cricket oval. The cricket stadium will become the launching ground for the new professional cricket league, along with a second stadium in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\n\"We are thankful to the fans for their support and to the city of Grand Prairie for believing in this vision,\" says MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta by email. \"Tickets are selling fast for the rest of the matches in North Texas and North Carolina, with sellouts expected for further games. We know our teams will put on an amazing show of explosive T20 cricket for the fans.\"\n\nIf you missed your chance to get tickets for MLC's opening day, the Grand Prairie stadium will host 11 more matches in July, including matches against teams like the San Francisco Unicorns, the Washington Freedom and the Seattle Orcas. The Grand Prairie stadium will also host the league's first championship match on July 30.\n\n\"Since we arrived in Texas, it's been incredible to see the support for the Texas Super Kings,\" says Texas team captain and former South African national cricket team captain Faf du Plessis. \"We can't wait to get out on the field at Grand Prairie Stadium and represent the Lone Star State in front of a full house.\"\n\nThis weekend, Arlington will host VNL's finals. The four teams that compete in Arlington for the championship medals will be determined by two days of quarterfinal matches: Poland vs. Germany and U.S. vs. Japan on Wednesday, and Brazil vs. China and Turkey vs. Italy on Thursday.\n\nTeam U.S.A.'s roster includes several top players from our neck of the woods, like Asjia O'Neal, who grew up in Southlake and played volleyball for the University of Texas. There, she was named All-American and helped achieve the school's fourth national championship in 2022. O'Neal finished UT's finals in 2022 with nine kills and a 0.43 hitting percentage, according to Texassports.com.\n\nMiddle player Chiaka Ogbogu from Coppell is also on the U.S. roster. She competed for the University of Texas, where she broke the school's record for career blocks in 2017 with 534. She also competed on the Olympic women's volleyball team and took home a gold medal at the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games, according to USAVolleyball.org.\n\nAs of Monday, the U.S. is one point away from first with 28 points, just behind Poland's 29 points. The U.S. has already won three VNL titles but the players will have their work cut out for them since Poland has had a stellar 10–2 season and are looking to score their first championship win this weekend."

        "date": "Thu Jul 13 18:56:11 2023",
        "body": "A mix of Pakistan cricket’s cream and some familiar expats will be in action in the United States when the inaugural season of the Major League Cricket (MLC) — a long-awaited T20 tournament — kicks off on Friday (July 14).\n\nFast bowler Haris Rauf and all-rounders Shadab Khan and Imad Wasim are some of the big names from Pakistan who will participate in the first-of-its kind event being jointly hosted in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nHaris and Shadab, the two centrally contracted players, will represent San Francisco Unicorns, while Imad will be playing for Seattle Orcas.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, Texas Super Kings, and Washington Freedom are the four other teams participating in the league. The 19-day competition will go on from July 13 to July 30 at Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park.\n\nThe announcements came in earlier this month as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) granted no-objection certificates (NOCs) to the players after getting approval from the team management, medical panel, and the selection committee.\n\nThere were reports suggesting that the PCB demanded $25,000 per player to grant the NOCs.\n\nSeveral international players, who left Pakistan for greener pastures of the US, will also be seen in action, including Hammad Azam, Sami Aslam, Ehsan Adil, Saif Badar, Saad Ali, and Mukhtar Ahmed. They will be participating in MLC as local players.\n\nAzam and Adil will be representing the New York franchise owned by the Mumbai Indians of the Indian Premier League. While they left the country almost two-and-a-half years ago, the duo officially announced their retirement from Pakistan cricket only last week, as per a press release from PCB on Sunday.\n\n“If you’re a former professional in another country, like Pakistan or West Indies, you have to show an NOC and an intent of retirement and then you’re considered a local for domestic leagues here,” Zubin Sarkari, tournament director of Minor League Cricket, said.\n\nSarkari, who is also currently handling operations at MLC, said that any player who can provide proof of intention to live in the US by having spent ten out of 12 months of the year in the country, and carries an approved visa is considered a local player by the domestic leagues’ management.\n\nLack of opportunities, excessive competition at home and, in a few cases, disregard from the PCB had led some of these cricketers to move to the USA.\n\nAslam, who has represented Pakistan in 13 Test matches and four One-Day Internationals, was dropped from the national squad in 2017. After struggling to find his way back in the team despite performing well domestically, the left-hander decided to move to the US in 2020 to seek a fresh start to his professional career.\n\n“Every player who is not playing in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is willing to come here,” Aslam told Dawn.com.\n\n“I know people who are currently leading teams in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy [and they are] saying that if they get an offer to play in the US, they will come here without thinking twice.”\n\nThe 27-year-old rued that countries such as Australia, England and India reward players who play red-ball cricket, but Pakistan ignores its longer format players. “That’s the reason why Test cricket is going down in the country.” he said.\n\n“Nobody wants to play the longer format and those who do, do it as an obligation. Players know that selectors don’t choose players who perform in the four-month long domestic season but the ones who perform in one season of the PSL.”\n\nCo-founded by Indian businessmen Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan among others, MLC has six teams, of which four are owned by various franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nAslam, who was picked by the Texas Super Kings in the domestic players draft held earlier in March, said he “wasn’t expecting to be picked by an IPL franchise because there were rumors of Indian teams not selecting Pakistani players but that didn’t happen”.\n\nHe added that they (the Super Kings) might have considered him as a US local resident instead.\n\n“I’m having a lot of fun. It’s a very professional setup. They (Chennai Super Kings) recently won the IPL and it is the same management for the Texas team so it is nice being a part of it.”\n\nBrashna Kasi is a Fulbright scholar and journalism graduate from Syracuse University New York."

MI New York claimed the inaugural championship crown, defeating the Seattle Orcas in the championship final on July 30 at Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium.\n\nAdditionally, Major League Cricket (MLC) and Cognizant announced today an agreement for the professional services company to become the first-ever title sponsor of America’s only world-class professional cricket championship.\n\nCognizant Major League Cricket will return for its second season this summer, kicking- off on July 4 and again bringing the world’s best cricketers to the United States for multiple weeks of high-adrenaline T20 cricket action.\n\n“Major League Cricket is thrilled to welcome Cognizant as our title sponsor, starting with season two of MLC this summer,” said Vijay Srinivasan, co-founder, of Major League Cricket. “This multi-year partnership will help enable the continued growth of MLC and cricket in America as this new era in the United States for the world’s second-largest sport continues to bloom.”\n\n“Cognizant is excited to support Major League Cricket’s vision, inspiring the next generation of cricket players,” said Ravi Kumar S, Chief Executive Officer, Cognizant. “Our extended relationship with MLC will help us create deeper connections with our clients and associates while giving back to the communities where we work and play through outreach and education to help invite historically excluded groups into sports and technology.”\n\nMLC expands Cognizant’s sports sponsorship portfolio, which spans across the PGA, LPGA, Aston Martin Formula 1 (AMF1) team, SailGP, and the English Football Association, representing a combination of the interest and passion of its clients for the inspiration and energy that sports provides. Cognizant’s sponsorships are aligned to its goals of showcasing the parallels between sport and technology and increasing diversity and inclusion in both arenas.\n\nThe 2024 MLC season will include matches returning to Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Grand Prairie, TX and at additional venues to be named later. More details on the 2024 season will be announced soon."

        "body": "A New Innings for Cricket in the Land of Opportunities\n\nIf you search for actual viewer numbers, it’s evident that cricket competes with soccer on a global scale. Soccer takes the lead with 3.5 billion viewers, while cricket follows closely with 2.5 billion. Cricket, frequently acknowledged for its substantial worldwide fanbase, has historically faced challenges in gaining traction in the United States. Nevertheless, a new era is emerging in American sports as Major League Cricket (MLC) steps onto the scene, unveiling an ambitious strategy to reshape the sporting landscape.\n\nThis ambitious endeavor aims to bring cricket, with all its grace and fervor, to the forefront of American sporting consciousness.\n\nIt all began in 1844 when the first international cricket game was played between the USA and Canada at the St George’s Cricket Club in New York. Following that, in 1859, a team of leading English professionals embarked on the first-ever overseas tour to North America.\n\nFast forward to 1965, the American Cricket Association was formed, marking the inception of organized cricket efforts in the United States. Since then, numerous endeavors have been made to popularize the sport, ranging from grassroots initiatives to international exhibition matches. However, it wasn’t until the establishment of Major League Cricket that American sports fans truly began to take notice.\n\nA Strategic Blueprint for Success\n\nHow Will MLC Become America’s Next Sports Obsession?\n\nMajor League Cricket’s strategy is to build on the large tradition of cricket with the demands of the modern American audience by presenting the sport as accessible and exciting, rather than an esoteric pastime. MLC understands that cricket’s rules and terminologies might be unfamiliar to many Americans, so they have taken measures to simplify and explain the intricacies of the sport.\n\nIn line with this approach, the inaugural 6 franchise teams consist of established franchises/organizations with significant expertise, resources, and a substantial fan base from their respective origins. Four of these franchises are derived from the highly prosperous Indian Premier League (IPL), while the remaining two represent Australian states, each having ties to the Big Bash League (BBL) franchises. Notably, the IPL, BBL, English T20 league, The Hundred, South African T20 league, and Caribbean T20 leagues have all achieved remarkable success in inspiring the creation of additional domestic leagues, fostering heightened fan engagement, participation, and enthusiasm.\n\nBeyond that, the league recognized the power of sports entertainment in America. As such, they aim to integrate captivating elements such as vibrant team identities, dynamic fan engagement strategies, and state-of-the-art arenas, creating an immersive experience for new MLC fans. By adapting cricket to fit the preferences of American sports enthusiasts while preserving its core essence, Major League Cricket is positioning itself for a shot at fandom success.\n\nOver the past few years, the MLC’s efforts have secured more than $40 million in funding and over $100 million in “handshakes” with private investors including tech giant Microsoft.\n\nFanning the Flames of Fandom\n\nWhat makes any sports team is its cult following and the undying passion of its fans.\n\nBy cultivating fan engagement through interactive experiences and initiatives like meet-and-greet sessions with players, MLC will ignite a new fan base and foster a sense of belonging.\n\nIn support of their on-site activations, MLC will use the power of social media and digital platforms, to reach wider audiences and create a virtual community for cricket fans across the nation.\n\nShaping the American Sports Narrative\n\nThe emergence of Major League Cricket has the potential to deepen the American love of sports and athleticism, joining the ranks of the NFL, NBA, and MLB. As cricket gains traction in the US, it introduces a new layer of diversity to the sporting landscape, offering a fresh perspective to sports fans in America.\n\nThe Minor League is also an integral part of this vision, which lays the foundation for sustainable and inclusive growth of cricket in the American sports scene, envisioning a future where cricket proudly stands among the nation’s top sports. It’s not simply about adding another sport to the weekend lineup, it’s about embracing new culture, fostering communities, and creating shared experiences that transcend the game.\n\nCricket is set to make its triumphant return to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. To prepare for the arrival of this exciting sport on American soil and the Olympics, brush up on Cricket terms HERE."

        "date": "Tue Nov 15 16:42:00 2022",
        "body": "Renovation works ongoing at Grand Prairie Stadium, which could be used for 2024 World Cup\n\nAfter several years of delays, the first season of Major League Cricket has been announced for July 13-30, 2023 with a newly renovated venue outside of Dallas, Texas serving as the primary location for the 18-day tournament. The announcement coincided with the installation of the turf square at Grand Prairie Stadium, with further renovation work to finish the transformation of the 7200 permanent-seat facility (which can be expanded to 15,000 with temporary seating for larger events) from a minor league baseball ground formerly known as Airhogs Stadium into a full-time cricket venue expected to be completed by the spring of next year.\n\n\"Next summer, the eyes of world cricket will be on the launch of Major League Cricket, with the stars of the game competing over three weeks of fast-paced T20 action,\" Justin Geale, MLC Tournament Director, said. \"The launch of MLC will transform American cricket and provide one of the best platforms in the sport for the world's most elite players to showcase their skills while also fast-tracking the development of domestic talent to feature in the league.\"\n\nA lease for the Grand Prairie facility was first acquired by MLC in November 2020 with renovation initially anticipated to be completed by early 2022. However, a series of delays pushed back not just the redevelopment of the venue but also the launch of MLC's first season by more than a year.\n\nDemolition and redevelopment at Grand Prairie Stadium finally began in July 2022 and has continued at a brisk pace in order to get it ready by next spring and make it the centerpiece venue of the competition. It means that organisers are now confident that the time is right to kick things off in 2023 and have picked out a window that they believe will avoid any clashes with both the CPL and the Hundred. The opportunity to play at a ground which is in the running to stage matches at the 2024 T20 World Cup, co-hosted by USA and the West Indies, is also expected to lure overseas professionals on the franchise circuit to play in MLC's first season.\n\nEarlier this year, MLC hired Dave Agnew as head curator to oversee the development of the cricket square at Grand Prairie Stadium and also to serve as a consultant on the development of other MLC facilities in the works. The Australian has previously worked as head curator at the CPL and the Global T20 Canada and has also done consultant work at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, which has hosted the first two tournament finals of the Minor League Cricket T20 championship that serves as a feeder competition into MLC.\n\n\"Grand Prairie Stadium will be the best cricket venue in the United States upon its completion,\" said Ron Jensen, Mayor of Grand Prairie. \"This venue will be a huge asset to the Grand Prairie community, bringing Major League Cricket, international cricket and potentially the 2024 ICC T20 Men's World Cup to Grand Prairie allowing fans here to experience a world-class sport in action.\"\n\nThe first season of MLC will be staged in a single round-robin format with 15 league matches played among six franchises before a four-match play-off phase. In addition to Dallas, MLC has previously announced that the franchises will be based in Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington DC, San Francisco and New York City. The Knight Riders Group has already come on board to be the owners of the Los Angeles franchise with a proposal in the works for a 10,000 seat venue in Orange County.\n\nHowever, the Orange County venue still has not been finalised, let alone broken ground, and stadium projects in the other cities have also been slow to materialise. It means that MLC organisers may end up using a single site in Grand Prairie for the entirety of the 2023 season. It is an approach that was similarly used to stage the Global T20 Canada in 2018 and 2019 in which all matches were played in suburban Toronto despite franchises being billed as hailing from cities all across Canada.\n\nUnlike the Global T20 Canada and many other big-ticket cricket events that have been held in the USA in which start times have been scheduled for late morning in blistering heat to accommodate for the Indian prime time TV audience, sources have said that organisers intend to utilise the floodlights at the facility to stage the majority of matches at night. It will allow for more comfortable playing conditions in the summer Texas heat and encourage more fans to support the event on the ground.\n\nSources have also stated that Church Street Park in North Carolina may potentially be used as a venue for some of MLC's matches in 2023. Even though no franchise is designated for North Carolina, the venue has demonstrated consistently strong fan support for local cricket since hosting the 2018 ICC Americas Regional T20 World Cup Qualifier and using it for some games would also alleviate wear and tear on the pitches at Grand Prairie.\n\nPeter Della Penna is ESPNcricinfo's USA correspondent @PeterDellaPenna"

        "body": "MS Dhoni, the Indian cricket legend, watched helplessly as the ball - possibly with flames coming out of it - disappeared into the terraces.\n\nHis trademark deadpan expression undersold the moment. Dhoni might have seen it all before during his long career, but he had rarely been on the receiving end of such a hijacking. Dhoni might even have allowed himself a wry smile as he recalled doing similar deeds in his pomp.\n\nThe ashen-faced capacity crowd in the normally rambunctious Chepauk told the story with eerie silence only punctuated by jubilation in the middle of the ground from Australian Marcus Stoinis, whose unbelievable century stole this gripping Indian Premier League match for Lucknow.\n\nIt was a reminder of the match-winning abilities of the muscular Stoinis, who has performed several miracles during his international career. When he is in the zone, there aren't many cleaner strikers of the cricket ball than Stoinis, whose nuggety built is more reminiscent of popular brutish football codes of his homeland - Australian rules and rugby.\n\nAfter striking one of the IPL's greatest innings, 124 off 63 balls to mow down the massive target of 211, Stoinis surely has cemented his spot in Australia's T20 World Cup squad, which is set to be announced next week.\n\nThere has been some uncertainty over Stoinis' international future. The 34-year-old was overlooked for last November's World Cup final against India with the Australian hierarchy's decision to stick with the more reliable batting presence of Marnus Labuschagne ultimately justified.\n\nIt has seemed like Australia might transition away from allrounder Stoinis, who was a hero in their drought-breaking T20 World Cup triumph in 2o21 with his death hitting proving crucial.\n\nAustralia have pivoted towards Tim David, who has lit up T20 franchise leagues around the world, as their death specialist while new sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk is also in the frame for World Cup selection having starred in the ongoing IPL.\n\nStoinis, however, provides a wealth of experience that those younger players don't yet have. His century came at an interesting juncture of his career after Stoinis missed out on a Cricket Australia contract for 2024-25.\n\nHe was also left off Western Australia's contract list, which wasn't particularly surprising given he didn't play for them at all this season. While not officially a T20 franchise freelancer, Stoinis has felt like one in recent seasons. He has rarely been sighted at the WACA given his traversing the planet, which can at times make it hard to remember where he is at any given moment.\n\nThere was a rather amusing anecdote in a Perth press box during the recent Big Bash League season, with a match from South Africa's T20 league beaming from the television. And in the frame was the unmistakable hulking figure of Stoinis. \"Wasn't he just in the BBL? I had no idea he was playing in South Africa,\" chuckled a reporter.\n\nStoinis will now have even greater flexibility to pursue opportunities on the T20 merry-go-round, including America's Major League Cricket with whom he played for in the tournament's debut season last year.\n\nBut Stoinis still wants to continue his international cricket even beyond the T20 World Cup. That remains to be seen, but Stoinis looms as a vital player in Australia's title hopes as he eyes silencing more stunned fans just like he did on that unforgettable night in Chepauk."

        "body": "The United States isn't the first place you think of when someone mentions cricket, but Liam Plunkett wants to change that perception this summer.\n\nThe former England fast bowler, 37, will star in Major League Cricket this July, a new T20 tournament which is hoping to attract some of the sport's biggest names. Plunkett, who is also Major League Cricket's national development coach, has not played professional cricket for nearly two years but is relishing the chance to test himself against the best.\n\n\"I still feel, for my age, I'm one of the fittest around,\" Plunkett tells Mirror Sport. \"Obviously the last year or so has been Minor League Cricket, but now it's building up to proper cricket. I've given myself a three-month window to be in tip-top shape for Major League Cricket. I'm taking it seriously - I'm there to compete and win games. I'm not there just to take part.\"\n\nThere is every expectation Plunkett will leave his mark on Major League Cricket this summer. Justin Geale, Major League Cricket's tournament director, notes, \"He's still a great player, and I can tell you he's absolutely steaming in at the moment!\"\n\nMajor League Cricket is America's first professional franchise tournament, with organisers hoping to establish the T20 game across the pond. An initial $120million has been secured to fund Major League Cricket, while four of the teams have landed investment from the Indian Premier League - cricket's biggest franchise tournament.\n\nThe likes of Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Marsh, Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje have already signed up to play in Major League Cricket, with more superstars expected to follow suit.\n\nAre you excited to watch Major League Cricket? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nPlunkett, who represented England in Tests, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and T20Is will always be remembered for what he achieved during the summer of 2019. The quick featured in seven of England's 11 ODI World Cup games - boasting a 100 per cent individual win rate - and played a vital role in their dramatic final triumph against New Zealand.\n\nBowling during the middle overs, Plunkett dismissed the likes of Rishabh Pant, Hashim Amla, Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson throughout the tournament. His international career concluded after the 2019 World Cup.\n\nAlthough he still wants to play against the best, Plunkett is determined to bring through the next generation of talent in America. He relocated to the United States with his wife, Emeleah, who is American.\n\n\"Let's see how this Major League Cricket goes,\" says Plunkett when asked about his ambitions as a player. \"I want to play a couple of years in the league, I want to see it grow. But also, one of my roles is [being] the national development coach in Major League Cricket.\n\n\"I want to keep helping the guys coming through, I want to try and provide high-performance training for them - however that looks like, we're still trying to figure that out.\n\n\"I'll play until I'm [still] competing and I feel like I can win games. As soon as I feel I can't contribute to a winning team, then I'll probably step away. But right now, I feel like I'm in a good space. In terms of other competitions, I don't think so... I'll put everything into Major League Cricket. I've played in a few masters’ leagues and that ticks me over, but let's see how this goes.\n\n\"Hopefully, I come out and I'm in a good position. If all goes well, you never know where that goes.\"\n\nPlunkett has also ruled out playing for his new country in the T20 World Cup, which is due to be held in the West Indies and the United States in June 2024. He knows an international call-up for the United States would deny an emerging player the chance to grace the international stage.\n\n\"Major League Cricket is who I work for and who I want to play for, and I think that's the biggest competition here. I just don't see it... just to play for a year. You have people grafting who want to play for the USA.\n\n“I'm at a point now... how good am I? Are the people coming through better than me? So, that's the first question - would I get selected? It's easy for me to say, 'Yeah, I'll play'. But you shouldn't be guaranteed a spot - you should have to work for that spot, not just have a name in cricket.\n\n\"I think if I did, I'd come in for that one World Cup and I think that defeats the purpose of developing youth and talent coming through.\""

It will become the latest T20 league to surface across the globe, just months after South Africa and the United Arab Emirates introduced their versions to the cricketing world and almost 15 years after the Indian Premier League (IPL) changed cricket forever.\n\n“It’s going to be a hell of a ride but the key is to get year one under way, show the world we can put out a product, get decent crowds in and I think the momentum will quickly build,” MLC tournament director, Justin Geale, told Al Jazeera before the draft.\n\n“So excited to be a part of @MLCricket @SFOUnicorns,” tweeted Finch, who captained Australia in white-ball cricket before announcing his retirement from internationals last month.\n\nThe 36-year-old will be joined by his former teammate Marcus Stoinis at the Unicorns as well as Victoria fast bowler Brody Couch, whose mother is American, making him eligible for the draft.\n\nFast bowler Liam Plunkett, who was part of the England side that won the 50-over World Cup in 2019, was also picked by the Unicorns in the draft.

We haven’t really struggled at all while talking to players.” Geale added.\n\nAccording to the MLC, the inaugural season will take place at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\n“The regular season will consist of five games, with each team playing each other once, followed by a playoff round and the championship on July 30,” an MLC statement said.\n\n“Teams will announce more big-name international signings as they become official, and each squad has a chance to pick another domestic player in early July based on performances in the Minor League Cricket season.”"

A total of 19 blockbuster T20 matches will be played in the tournament. MLC released the full schedule of the tournament via its official Twitter page on Monday.

        "body": "In 2015, I wrote an article seeking to answer a question: Could cricket in the U.S. be a worthwhile investment? I flew to New York City to watch a tour of the world’s cricketing all-stars because, having fallen in love with the sport thanks to business travel to India and England, I was curious about its viability in America. Not long ago, the idea that Major League Soccer franchises would pop up in cities across America, each competing for international talent, was a dream to some, and a joke to others.\n\nCricket? It’s too complicated. Don’t matches stretch on for days? It will never work. But might the MLC and the Indian diaspora attract a legend at the end of his career, like MLS and its “soccer is life” Latino population attracted Messi to Miami? The night before Seattle’s match, the Texas Super Kings played the LA Knight Riders to commence tournament play. Ross Perot Jr.’s Super Kings beat the Knight Riders by a score of 181 runs and the loss of six wickets to 112 runs with the loss of all 10 wickets.\n\nThanks to an agreement with the Indian Premier League (IPL), several of the American teams share IPL mascots. Chenai and Texas are the Super Kings, Mumbai and New York are the Indians, Kolkata and Los Angeles are the Knight Riders. All six teams — Texas, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. — began this week’s tournament in Texas, to be continued in North Carolina, and then return to Texas for the playoffs on July 27.\n\nThe scene in Grand Prairie\n\nMajor League Cricket debuted to a sellout crowd of around 7,000 fans with the kind of diversity the NFL, the NBA, and MLB can only dream about. Television networks from around the world, including America’s Willow cable channel, broadcast the game live to hundreds of millions in cricket-mad places like India, Australia and New Zealand, the U.K., and South Africa. International news outlets have run coverage almost hourly through the weekend.\n\nMLC took over an abandoned independent league baseball stadium (the Airhogs) in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, and invested heavily in a world class cricket oval. There, fans in Dallas Cowboys gear and Bass Pro Shop hats mixed with the national team jerseys from every cricket nation. Country and Western, Bollywood, and hip-hop blasted overhead. Fans munched on chickpeas and rice seasoned with Tex-Mex Chipotle hot sauce. The Dallas metroplex made for a surprising backdrop. Looming over the new cricket stadium is Lone Star Park, a hulking horse racing venue. Soaring above the racetrack’s spire, commercial jets take off and land from nearby DFW Airport.\n\nInside the arena, an English gentleman from Birmingham, more recently residing in Jacksonville, stayed over in Dallas when he learned he could catch the first-ever Major League Cricket game. Tim Miller, 54, and his son Iain, 18, live locally in the Dallas metroplex and were standing near the field an hour before the action began. Iain began playing with friends, mostly Indian, in a nearby park as the pandemic began. He fell in love with the game and has now tried out for an Under-19 team. He and his father watch cricket on Willow. Mark Roberts and his kids, 10 and 13, drove 12 hours from Fort Collins, Colo., to see the launch. Dad took an interest in 2018 when he stumbled across the sport on Willow. He wanted to introduce his kids to cricket because “it’s a better alternative to baseball.” Why? The action. Like a winter league baseball game in the Caribbean, fans blew whistles and anticipated, and then reacted to, every play of the game.\n\nBy all accounts, the cricket grounds and the quality of play were top-notch. Likewise, the league clearly invested in slick, professional video and merchandise. Cricket in the Pacific Northwest Orcas cricket is backed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Madrona Venture Group Managing Director S. Soma Somasegar; Icertis co-founder and CEO Samir Bodas; GreatPoint Ventures managing partner Ashok Krishnamurthi; and former Microsoft and Avalara executive Sanjay Parthasarathy.\n\nSoma and his family attended both Orcas games over the weekend. “Seattle was initially not a day 1 city for the league,” he said. “But because of the strong and vibrant fan base and sports community in Seattle we made Seattle a day 1 city for the league. We have an important fan base to build upon.” He pointed out that the U.S. and Seattle should be part of the world’s second most popular sport. “Sports bring people from different perspectives together” he said. “ We want to unify.” Tech hubs like Seattle and Silicon Valley in California have long attracted software programmers from India. The Asian Indian population in the U.S. has grown steadily, rising from 2 million in 2000 to more than 5 million. In the Seattle area, Microsoft is incorporating a recreational cricket pitch on its new campus in Redmond. King County’s Marymoor Park, where Seattle’s amateur league has played for decades, envisions its own professionally-run stadium.\n\nWhat’s next for MLC?\n\nSeattle will play three more matches in Morristown, N.C., over the weekend. The teams return to Texas for the championship round. Beyond that, it’s a little uncertain. MLC franchises expect to have their grounds in order by the 2025 season. Tom Dunmore, who heads MLC marketing, said the hope is that 2025 will be the first regular season.\n\nNext year, the U.S. and the West Indies (Jamaica, Bahamas, Antigua) will co-host cricket’s World Cup. The International Cricket Committee (ICC), the equivalent of soccer’s FIFA, is currently working to identify host cities. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland are possibilities. With the Oakland Athletics heading to Las Vegas, that could open up a suitable stadium. The Oakland Coliseum is known for its generous foul territory, which would enable a proper cricket oval. Dunmore says MLC will wait to see what the ICC comes up with, and perhaps next year’s MLC tournament could be played on a World Cup pitch. “Not to be cliché, but if you build it people will come,” Dunmore said."

Sanjay Govil, Washington Freedom Owner & Executive Chairman of Infinite Computer Systems, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the league and the sport's popularity in the United States and abroad.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Professional cricket is coming to the United States. The inaugural match for Major League Cricket, it's set to air today. The league, which was initially meant to debut in 2021, was shut down due to the COVID pandemic. It's now coming back for its first season. Hosted out of stadiums in Texas and North Carolina, Major League Cricket will span 18 days, have 19 matches, and will show the best of the best from six different professional cricket teams.\n\nWe're joined by someone who believes cricket will crack into the US audience. That is Washington Freedom owner, that's one of the new teams, as well as founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Systems, Sanjay Govil. Thank you so much for being here, Sanjay. It's pretty cool, it's not every day that you see a new sport and a new professional league come to fruition.\n\nSo how did this happen? How did the league come together? How did you get involved?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: So obviously, first of all, thank you so much for having us and promoting cricket in the US. We are very excited. We have been at this for many, many years. US does have a history of cricket. There used to be a Philadelphia Cricket Club in the 1800s when cricket was semi-popular in the US.\n\nAnd for the last 15, 20 years, there have been a lot of cities and leagues where cricket is actually played. And this was the time when we felt that we have an opportunity for a Major League Cricket league and to have the Washington freedom team based right here in Washington DC.\n\n- And so when we think about the makeup of this league and what's going to make it successful, what does the first season, two seasons, what do you believe that that has to hold? What does that have to entail in order for it to get off to a booming start?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: I think awareness. Being on Yahoo Finance today, that's one step towards that. There's already a lot of buzz which is being created. Most of our matches, if not all, are sold out, considering the fact that we only got going in terms of ticket sales about a month back. So there's a lot of excitement, a lot of buzz, and it's leading to a numerous things. Next year, the World Cup is happening. The T20 World Cup. US is one of the home grounds for that. And then 2028 Olympics, hopefully cricket will become part of that.\n\nSo there's just a lot of excitement, and our goal is to create that buzz, create what people want, give a product bring world class stars. And also the most important thing is to promote US cricket.\n\n- And as we talked about, for now, the teams are going to be playing in just a couple of locations. If people are not there, how can they watch these cricket matches? How is the sort of airing rights worked out?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: Sure. So in the US, we are telecasting on Willow TV and also on CBS. A few games are coming on CBS. And then we have media partners across the world. So we're going to have a substantial number of people watching. 2.5 billion people who watch cricket or big fans of cricket across the world. Second most popular sport in the world after soccer.\n\nSo we see a huge opportunity, and we see a lot of passion already happening in terms of cricket.\n\n- So that's really interesting, Sanjay. So you're expecting not just to benefit from people who are cricket fans in the US, but globally who are interested in this league. Are you drawing on the people who are playing in these leagues? Are they also members of cricket teams across the globe?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: Absolutely. I would say most of them have played or are playing for their countries today. And not only that, we have players who have played in the Indian Premier League and other leagues across the world. So these are really, really household names who we have here in the US.\n\nSo we are very honored and privileged that in our very first year, we have the quality of players who have come. And we are really, really excited to see that. And the American audience is really, really excited to see those players play, because we only see them on TV or if we have gone to countries where they are playing. But now to have them come to the US and play here is really a big thing for us.\n\n- Talk to us about the fan experience. I mean, when people go to a sporting event, they want to be close to the players, they want to have that access into them, they want to be able to watch them from wherever as well if they can't go to the match. So what does that fan experience look like?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: That's a very good question. So we are actually building a stadium at George Mason University. And just to answer the previous question in terms of where they can watch, right now is Dallas and Morrisville which is near Raleigh, but we are building stadiums across the country. DC is going to have a stadium in the George Mason University Campus. George Mason is the biggest university, public university in Virginia.\n\nAnd the fan experience is going to be all around what we as Americans enjoy, which is fast-paced. No more than three hours, go in there, have our hot dogs, hamburgers, beer. Cheer the teams, have a good time. And family-oriented and kids-oriented. So that's the kind of experience we want to have around our matches.\n\n- I noticed that when I look at the owners here, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft has another-- his team is called the Seattle Orcas. Cricket is huge in India and obviously, you guys are Indian-Americans. And so has a huge cultural importance there as well. How do you sort of broaden the appeal? I mean, you're talking about it in American terms, as a sport, it has the same appeal as a baseball or some other sports like that. So how do you sort of broaden that appeal?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: We broaden them by making them more aware. I mean, whenever I talk to people who have grown up here, the good news is that they've all heard of cricket, which is great. And there's been a lot of cross connects between the US and cricket-playing countries. There's a big immigrant population, which has actually come here. Their children go to elementary schools, junior school, high schools, colleges, universities. They talk to their friends about cricket. So cricket is a known thing.\n\nThe stigma which cricket had was, oh, my God, it's five days long, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But there's a shorter version, which is the three-hour version, which we are playing here now. So we just have to expand on that.\n\nPickleball, for example, has really caught on just in a matter of two or three years. And we feel that we have a very good product, and we feel that we can really expand the reach of what we have.\n\n- Wow, cricket, the next pickleball. We'll see. I mean, that would be great for you guys as pickleball has grown very quickly. Sanjay, what a pleasure to talk to you. Really fun stuff, and we'll be watching the matches. Washington Freedom owner as well as Infinite Computer Systems founder and chairman, Sanjay Govil, thank you.\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: Thank you so much. And thank you for your time and giving us this opportunity to promote cricket.\n\n- Yes, of course, take care."

        "body": "The Major League Cricket Draft took place earlier today in the United States of America, where six teams formed their squads for the inaugural edition of MLC. Four of the six franchises are owned by teams that have an IPL franchise.\n\nMumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals, and Kolkata Knight Riders have invested in the USA's new league. The names of their teams are MI New York, Team Texas, Seattle Orcas, and Los Angeles Knight Riders. The other two teams are Washington Freedom and San Franciso Unicorns.\n\nThe USA is still growing as a cricketing nation and does not have too many top-tier local talents, but several international stars like Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Wanindu Hasaranga, Anrich Nortje, Quinton de Kock, and Mitchell Marsh will make the competition special.\n\nApart from that, several other cricketers who left their nation and joined the USA will also be in action.\n\nFormer South African speedster Rusty Theron, former New Zealand star Corey Anderson, former England pacer Liam Plunkett, and former Pakistan player Sami Aslam are some names who have earned contracts in the Major League Cricket Draft.\n\nA few former Indian domestic cricketers have also made it to the Major League Cricket 2023 squads. Here is the complete list.\n\n#1 Unmukt Chand - Los Angeles Knight Riders\n\nThe biggest Indian name to earn a contract was Unmukt Chand. The Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) signed him at the MLC 2023 Draft. During his time as an active Indian cricketer, Chand played for three IPL franchises.\n\nHe made his debut for the Delhi Daredevils and then moved to the Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians. Later this year, Chand will make his debut for LAKR.\n\n#2 Harmeet Singh - Seattle Orcas\n\nHarmeet Singh was the first draft pick in the Major League Cricket 2023. Seattle Orcas signed the all-rounder, who was born in Mumbai. He bats left-handed and bowls left-arm spin.\n\nLike Unmukt Chand, Singh was a part of the Rajasthan Royals squad once during his IPL career. He even represented Mumbai and Tripura in domestic cricket.\n\n#3 Tajinder Singh - San Francisco Unicorns\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns snapped up former Indian all-rounder Tajinder Singh at the MLC 2023 Draft. Singh was born in Rajasthan and played domestic cricket for his home state.\n\nThe right-arm off-spin bowler represented a couple of franchises, namely Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians, in the IPL.\n\n#4 Chaitanya Bishnoi - San Francisco Unicorns\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi is a batting all-rounder from Delhi, who has been a member of the Chennai Super Kings squad from 2018 to 2019. He is a former IPL champion as well.\n\nBishnoi will don the San Francisco Unicorns jersey in MLC 2023. He has the experience of playing in 50 T20 matches.\n\n#5 Saurabh Netravalkar - Washington Freedom\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar captained India U-19s in the U-19 World Cup 2010. Current Indian superstars KL Rahul and Mayank Agarwal played under his leadership for India U-19s.\n\nWhile Rahul and Agarwal are now among the highest-paid players in the IPL, Netravalkar has retired from Indian cricket. He has joined the USA team and will play for Washington Freedom in the Major League Cricket.\n\n#6 Sarabjeet Ladda - MI New York\n\nSarabjeet Ladda is a former Indian leg-break bowler, who played for the Delhi Daredevils, Gujarat Lions and Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. Ladda also represented Punjab at the domestic level.\n\nThe 36-year-old has now moved to the United States. He will make his Major League Cricket debut for MI New York.\n\n#7 Smit Patel - San Francisco Unicorns\n\nSmit Patel was a member of the India U-19s squad that lifted the ICC U-19 World Cup 2012 under Unmukt Chand's captaincy. Like Chand, Patel has now left India and settled in the USA.\n\nPatel played for the Barbados Royals in the Caribbean Premier League. He will represent San Francisco Unicorns in the MLC.\n\n#8 Milind Kumar - Team Texas\n\nFormer Delhi Daredevils and Royal Challengers Bangalore player Milind Kumar was picked up by Team Texas at the Major League Cricket 2023 Draft. Kumar is an off-spin bowling all-rounder.\n\nHe has played 58 T20 matches in his career, scoring 1,176 runs and scalping five wickets. It will be interesting to see how he performs in the Major League Cricket."

        "date": "Sun Oct 22 00:07:00 2023",
        "body": "CRICKET is back in the Olympics and Jamaica must seize this opportunity.\n\nIt was predictable, and the International Cricket Council (ICC) had been working on it for years. In Twenty20 (T20) they found a workable, widely played format with such revenue virility it became an irresistible progeniture. While content acquisition budgets are exploding and being gobbled up by both old and new individual leagues with addressable fan bases, Olympic revenue growth is burdened by too many un-monetisable sports. Even our hallowed track and field as an individual sport isn’t amongst the top ten watched globally.\n\nThe English Premier League (football) and Indian Premier League (cricket) with their US$6-billion domestic rights deals, and even Major League Soccer’s US$2.5-billion agreement with AppleTVillustrate the siphoning of resources by even previously unheralded sports leagues. With the ever-increasing cost of hosting, it was inevitable the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would welcome back cricket to tap into its massive viewership and burgeoning coffers. Experts are already predicting a tenfold increase in Olympic rights in India – a US$200-million-dollar impact. Coinciding with T20 being confirmed as the latest Olympic sport, the United States is co-hosting the T20 World Cup in 2024. No sooner had Major League Cricket concluded its first successful season in the US, a new “American Cricket League” is announced. Perhaps it’s just a remarkable coincidence or maybe these are unencrypted, not-so-secret transmissions for which we require no special enigma cypher.\n\nImpact on Jamaican Cricket\n\nBeing an Olympic sport fosters investment and development. Since only individual nations can participate in the Olympics as a rule, West Indies cricket, that amorphous, non-existent nation, must tap its component countries to extract the precious and badly needed benefits. There should be no thought of abandoning Jamaica’s Olympic legacy and competing under a “WI” umbrella. We are Olympic royalty; the black, green and gold hoisted above all others to the crescendo of “Jamaica, land we love” is as much our identity as being synonymous with the Olympics itself.\n\nICC craved Olympic recognition to accelerate growth in the sport globally, especially among its 96 associate member countries. As an Olympic sport these governing bodies will have stronger cases to harvest national resources from both public and private sector purses, not to mention the potential sliver of Olympic revenues. The Olympic imprint carries a special aura that transcends commercial, corporate social responsibility and government budgets, bringing unique funding dexterity. It’s also why the NFL lobbied the IOC so hard and successfully to have American “flag football” included.\n\nOlympic Qualification\n\nThe Jamaica Cricket Association (JCA) and its regional counterparts should propose and lobby the ICC and IOC for the structuring of Olympic qualification to favour our interest. Notwithstanding the initial limit of six male and female teams for 2028, let’s think medium and long term. Olympic soccer started with eight teams back in 1908, which has since doubled. It could be eight T20 national teams by the Brisbane edition in 2032, growing to 10 or 12 by 2036, Mumbai being the hot favourite to host. Surely, Jamaica has the capability to plot our path to at least the latter as an Olympic cricket team.\n\nLet’s propose that the only automatic Olympic qualifiers be the top four ICC-ranked teams. Where it gets interesting is how we might determine the non-automatic qualifiers. The ICC currently holds geographic regional qualifiers for the T20 World Cup. Indeed, teams like Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Panama, Argentina, etc battle through these regionals (Americas, Asia, etc). A Caribbean Olympic Qualification Region should be added. Given that there are 14 countries under CWI, our contribution to world cricket, and with no other way to participate, we deserve our own qualification region. Imagine the new prestige of Jamaica vs Barbados in a “T20 Olympic Qualifier” under the lights at Sabina Park. The life it could breathe back into regional cricket is immeasurable! The top two from the Caribbean region would join the other ranked ICC teams and regional qualifiers in a tournament for the remaining spots on the Olympic stage. In T20 any team, on any day, in the right conditions, can win. That’s the simplistic beauty T20 has brought to the game, levelling the playing field. So why can’t we see Jamaica beating England in a T20 eliminator for a shot at Olympic glory!\n\nThe same should be done for T20 World Cup qualifiers. Imagine our Caribbean teams battling it out in T20 World Cup qualification every two years and the Olympics every four. Don’t be surprised. And maybe it’s inevitable, given the meteoric rise of T20, if the Pan American Games gets added to the mix. That would be a non-stop, competitive international calendar for national T20 teams. Ultimately, this must benefit WI cricket. Of course there is the sticky issue of the CPL and any prohibitions on inter-country, competitive T20 matches. But surely there is a difference between franchise cricket and a national team playing to qualify for the Olympic Games.\n\nIf we continue to ignore it all and pretend nothing has changed we could see lesser teams like Oman, Japan and even Denmark one day make their Olympic mark in a sport we once dominated, while we wistfully muse on the glory days and what might have been. We need to look no further than the Netherlands’ rise to see the future. I believe we should dream big and be proactive if we are to benefit from cricket returning to the Olympics. It will not be easy and won’t happen overnight. It will require strategy, determination and courage.\n\nBut perhaps it is a last, beckoning chance to return Jamaica and WI cricket to relevance."

But the T20 version, which six US teams will play for the next two weeks, is much shorter (each match lasts about three hours) and has simplified rules for our tiny little TikTok brains.\n\nHaven’t we tried to make America care about cricket before? Yes, many times since the early 2000s. But with a growing Indian American population in the US and the surging popularity of international sports like Formula One racing and soccer (welcome, Messi), it could finally be cricket’s time to shine.\n\nAnd if it fails, it won’t be for lack of funding: Some of the biggest business execs in the US, including Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and other investors have pledged at least $120 million to the league to make sure cricket finally sticks."

        "body": "After a summer of regular changes to the Minor League Cricket timetable, the league has finally made an announcement with some permanence. On Saturday USA Cricket announced the 24 franchises and owners of Minor League Cricket, only one of which is listed as fully owned by the league (Sacramento). Team names range from the refreshingly relevant Philadelphians and Morrisville Cardinals, to the curious Atlanta Param Veers, a reference to India’s highest military honour.\n\nThe field of 24 has been announced one week before the new August 22 date for the official Minor League Cricket draft, and includes some notable owners such as former USACA board members, former national team cricketers, CPL franchise owners, and a few LLCs with no names attached. The draft date was recently moved back in order to “provide teams with additional time to evaluate players and allow further planning in advance of the Draft,” per the announcement.\n\nTentative exhibition games are being planned for September and October, perhaps in time for the return of the six ICC Americas players currently in Trinidad for the Caribbean Premier League, depending on Minor League Cricket’s quarantine guidelines. The CPL has taken great measures to ensure the safety of players and staff, requiring overseas players to arrive two weeks prior to the competition and quarantine in their hotels. CPL will stage two games per day between only two Trinidad venues, a bubble approach which will expedite the league schedule and increase viewership in India, due to the earlier local start times and the time zone difference. Minor League Cricket has yet to announce their own Covid-19 related protocols, outside of the fact that travel would be limited to inter-division teams, and that the exhibition “matches will only proceed in conjunction with all local, county, and state authorities’ guidelines.”\n\nThe full list of teams, their cities and owners, as per the USA Cricket release is as follows;\n\nKeep up with news and events happening in the emerging game through our Facebook and Twitter pages.\n\nLooking for audio content on the emerging game?

The inaugural Major League Cricket season is now underway!\n\nMajor League Cricket 2023: preview\n\nThe United States officially has its first professional franchise T20 cricket competition and, of course, it had to be called Major League Cricket. Whether or not it succeeds, it's an undeniably intriguing development, and MLC has recruited aggressively, luring in big names such as Quinton de Kock, Jason Roy and Wanindu Hasaranga with lucrative contracts.\n\nThe inaugural MLC season features six teams, four of which are owned or part-owned by IPL franchises. Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York and Texas Super Kings are all self-evident, then there's the Delhi Capitals-affiliated Seattle Orcas. San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom are the two outliers.\n\nEach team will face off once, after which the top four will qualify for the playoffs. The top two seeds will play a Qualifier, with the winner booking a spot in the MLC final on July 31. The second seed will then play the winner of the Eliminator between the third and fourth seeds.\n\nWith Anrich Nortje, Martin Guptill, Aaron Finch and Trent Boult also involved, the MLC certainly isn't short of star-power. The feeling is that it's come at the near-total expense of local talent, with only seven US-born players being selected at the Major League Cricket draft in March.\n\nAll games will be played at either Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas, or Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.

Seattle, Washington and was announced in 2023 as one of six inaugural franchises to play in Major League Cricket.[2] The Seattle Orcas are owned by an investor group including Satya Nadella, Soma Somasegar, Samir Bodas, Ashok Krishnamurthi, and Sanjay Parthasarathy – and the GMR Group.[3] The Orcas have a minor league affiliate called the Seattle Thunderbolts,[4] who play in Minor League Cricket and were the 2022 champions.[5]\n\nThe team plans to have their home ground at Marymoor Park in Redmond, Washington.[6] The park's cricket ground is set to have a capacity of up to 6,000 people once it is completed around 2025.[7] The team is coached by former Indian cricketer Pravin Amre.[8]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nIn November 2021, the Bellevue City Council passed a resolution to support further research into the cost and feasibility for a cricket facility in Seattle.[9] This was followed by a similar resolution that the Redmond City Council adopted in January 2022.[10] A motion of support to develop a cricket facility in Marymoor Park was then passed by King County in February 2022.[6][11] In May 2022, Major League Cricket announced that Somasegar and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella were among some of the lead investors launching Major League Cricket in the U.S.[12]\n\nIn March 2023, MLC unveiled the team ownership, name, and logo prior to the inaugural MLC domestic draft.[13] It was also announced that the team would partner with the GMR Group, who co-owns the Delhi Capitals of the Indian Premier League.[14] Co-owner Somasegar stated that the Orcas name and colors \"pay tribute to our local community [of Seattle] that has helped build that spirit of support\".[15] On May 27, 2023, it was revealed that the Orcas had revamped their logo to emphasize its focus on cricket.[16]\n\nSeason History[edit]\n\n2023 season[edit]\n\nSee also: 2023 Seattle Orcas Season\n\nPrior to the launch of the official season, it was announced the MLC's inaugural domestic draft would take place on March 19, 2023.[17] The Orcas' had the first pick of the draft and selected Thunderbolts captain Harmeet Singh as their first overall draft pick, before adding the likes of Shehan Jayasuriya, Angelo Perera, and Shubham Ranjane in later draft selections.[18] In addition, Mitchell Marsh and Quinton de Kock were announced as some of the team's overseas signings during the draft.[19] Over the following months, several more overseas signings occurred, including the signings of Wayne Parnell, Dasun Shanaka, and Heinrich Klaasen – amongst others.[20][21][22]\n\nThe team also announced their lineup of support staff, with Johan Botha coming onboard as the team's bowling coach, Ross Taylor as the team's batting coach, Pravin Amre as the team's head coach, and Jarrod Harkness as the team analyst.[8]\n\nPrior to the start of the season, Mitchell Marsh and Sikandar Raza – who were both included in the Orcas squad – withdrew from MLC due to it clashing with other tournaments such as the Ashes and the Zim Afro T10.[23]\n\nIn the start to their inaugural campaign, the Orcas' went top of the table by recording a 5-wicket win over the Washington Freedom,[24] a 35-run win over the San Francisco Unicorns,[25][26] and an 8-wicket win over the Texas Super Kings.[27] The Orcas' winning streak was snapped, however, during a 2-wicket defeat to the Los Angeles Knight Riders.[28] A 2-wicket win over MI New York assured the Orcas' a first-place finish going into the finals nevertheless.[29]\n\nCurrent squad[edit]\n\nPlayers with

        "date": "Fri May 26 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Moeen Ali is the latest England star to be targeted by America's Major League Cricket and his Indian Premier League side are planning to offer him a multi-franchise deal that would include him joining Texas Super Kings.\n\nOn Thursday Jason Roy terminated his England incremental contract to play in the United States, provoking fears others may follow suit.\n\nAnd Moeen – unlike Roy, a centrally contracted player – is wanted by Texas, who are owned by Chennai Super Kings. Chennai also own a side in the South African 20 league, the Joburg Super Kings, and want to recruit Moeen for that side too.\n\nTexas tried to sign Moeen for this season’s Major League Cricket tournament but, as a centrally contracted England player, Moeen was not permitted to play. But Texas are very hopeful that Moeen will be signed in time for the 2024 season.\n\nMoeen is under a central contract until October 1. He is a crucial part of England’s plans for this year’s 50-over World Cup in India, but could well retire from the ODI game after the tournament. “It could be a time where I'm thinking that's me done now,” he said in March.\n\nThe 2024 T20 World Cup will be played in June in the West Indies and America, and Moeen could still be involved in that competition. But the tournament could mark the natural end-point for his international career, with England planning to regenerate their side after the T20 World Cup. Moeen turns 36 next month and would be at, or near, 39 years old by the time of the 2026 T20 World Cup.\n\nThe 2024 edition of Major League Cricket is due to begin soon after the World Cup, and Super Kings hope that Moeen will feature for Texas in the competition. Unless England change their stance on centrally contracted players being barred from appearing in Major League Cricket – which is unlikely, given the clash with the England domestic summer – Moeen could only appear if he no longer had his international contract or had retired from international duty.\n\nMoeen is one of the most-coveted T20 players in the world, highly-valued for his adaptability and selflessness. While renowned for his hitting of spin, he can also be destructive against pace, and is happy moving up or down the order as required. His off-spin, which is deployed both with the new ball and in the middle overs, provides essential balance for a side. Moeen is in his third season with Chennai, and was the first Englishman to play on the winning side in the final in 2021.\n\nMoeen rejoined Warwickshire this season and captains the Birmingham Bears, the side’s T20 team, in the T20 Blast. This year, rather than play in South Africa's T20 league, he appeared in the ILT20 in UAE, but Super Kings are hopeful that he will also be able to represent Joburg in future seasons, meaning that he would represent all three Super Kings sides.\n\nChennai Super Kings have already shown that they intend to contact leading figures across their franchises in other T20 leagues. Stephen Fleming, Chennai’s head coach, performs the same role for both Joburg and Texas."

        "body": "The inaugural edition of Major League Cricket (MLC) will begin on Friday. The six-team tournament will feature eight Indian players who have recently announced retirement from Indian cricket to pursue their cricketing careers in USA.\n\nSome of the prominent names are India U-19 World Cup-winning captain Unmukt Chand and his teammates Smit Patel and Harmeet Singh. Ambati Rayudu had signed up with Texas Super Kings but pulled out of the tournament last week due to personal reasons.\n\nActive Indian players are barred from playing in overseas franchise leagues, including MLC, but the ones who have announced their retirement are allowed.\n\nHere are the Indian players who will be in action in MLC 2023:\n\nUnmukt Chand (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nThe former India Under-19 World Cup skipper was picked by Los Angeles Knight Riders for $65,000 in the MLC player draft. The right-handed batter had announced his retirement from Indian cricket in August 2021 and moved to the USA.\n\nChand had a brief stint in the Indian Premier League (IPL) between 2011 and 2016, where he played 21 matches for Delhi Capitals (2011-13), Rajasthan Royals (2014) and Mumbai Indians (2015-16). He had little success, however, scoring 300 runs at a strike rate of 100.00 and averaging 15.00. The Delhi-born batter has also played franchise cricket in Australia (Big Bash League) and Bangladesh (Bangladesh Premier League).\n\nUnmukt Chand T20 career stats\n\nHarmeet Singh (Seattle Orcas)\n\nChand’s 2012 Under-19 World Cup teammate was one of the six players to be picked in the first round of the MLC player draft for $75,000 by Seattle Orcas. The left-arm spinner has played just one IPL game, for Rajasthan Royals in 2013. He picked one for 34 from his four overs in his lone experience in the league.\n\nOnce compared to spin legend Bishen Singh Bedi, Harmeet made his First-Class debut for Mumbai in 2009 and picked seven wickets in the game against Himachal Pradesh. From 2017-18, he played for Tripura in the Indian domestic circuit till 2020 before retiring from Indian cricket in 2021 and moving to USA.\n\nHarmeet Singh T20 career stats\n\nSmit Patel (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe wicketkeeper-batter also shot to fame during India’s Under-19 World Cup win in 2012 under the leadership of Chand. He was India’s second highest run-scorer in the tournament, after Chand, scoring 178 runs in six games at an average of 59.33. He made his First-Class debut for Gujarat in the same year before playing for Tripura as a “guest player” in search of more opportunities. He ended his First-Class career in 2020 with Goa with a game against his original team Gujarat.\n\nSmit ended his Indian domestic career with Baroda in 2021 before deciding to move to USA. In 2021, he plied his trade for Barbados Royals in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL).\n\nSmit Patel T20 career stats\n\nSarbjeet Singh Ladda (MI New York)\n\nThe leg-spinner from Punjab has an impressive First-Class record with 89 wickets in just 28 games. Ladda made his debut in 2007 and was Punjab’s second highest wicket-taker in the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy season. He earned an IPL cap in 2010 with Delhi Capitals and picked four wickets in five games at an economy rate of 9.53 in his debut season. He then played three matches for Kolkata Knight Riders between 2011 and 2013 but managed just one wicket.\n\nHis last IPL appearance was for Gujarat Lions in 2016. He played just one match that season and was wicketless in the two overs that went for 21 runs. That was also his last T20 match. Ladda’s First-Class career ended in 2015 while his last List A game was back in 2010.\n\nSarbjeet Singh Ladda T20 career stats\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nBishnoi played the most recent Indian domestic season, opening the batting for Haryana across formats. He was his side’s top run-scorer in the T20 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with 217 runs in eight matches but at an underwhelming strike rate of 104.32. In the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy, Bishnoi was Haryana’s third leading run-getter and scored 213 runs in six innings and also struck a hundred (134). In the Ranji Trophy, Bishnoi amassed 282 runs in eight innings, averaging 35.25 and picked three wickets with his left-arm spin.\n\nThe 28-year-old was bought by Chennai Super Kings for his base price of Rs. 20 lakh in 2018 and was retained by the side for the 2019 season but never played an IPL match.\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi T20 career stats\n\nTajinder Singh Dhillon (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe lower-order batter from Rajasthan has an impressive career strike rate of 144.16 in T20s and is also a handy off-spinner who has a career economy of 6.52 in the shortest format of the game. He was picked for Rs. 55 lakh by Mumbai Indians in the 2018 auctions before Punjab Kings acquired his services for Rs. 20 lakh in 2020. Despite his penchant for big-hitting, Tajinder never played an IPL match. He made his First-Class, List A and T20 debut for Rajasthan in 2017 and plied his trade in the Indian domestic circuit till 2019.\n\nTajinder Singh Dhillon T20 career stats\n\nMilind Kumar (Texas Super Kings)\n\nMilind is a proven performer on the Indian domestic circuit. The all-rounder made his First-Class debut for Delhi in 2011 and has also represented Sikkim and Tripura in the Ranji Trophy. The right-handed batter amassed 1,331 runs for Sikkim in Ranji Trophy 2018-19 in the Plate Division, which is the third highest tally in a single season. In a testament to his all-round abilities, Milind also picked 22 wickets with his off-spin in the same season. The 32-year-old played his last game in Indian domestic cricket in 2021 for Tripura before announcing his retirement.\n\nThe Delhi-born all-rounder was picked by Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore but never made his IPL debut. Milind has an impressive average in First-Class and List A cricket, 46.68 and 43.04, respectively. In T20s, he has a strike rate of 112.32, which has surged to 142.97 in Minor League Cricket.\n\nMilind Kumar T20 career stats\n\nShubham Ranjane (Seattle Orcas)\n\nRanjane is of rich cricketing heritage. His grandfather Vasant played seven Test matches for India between 1958 and 1964 while his father Subash reperesented Maharashtra in 29 First-Class and 11 List A games. Following in his footsteps, Shubham played 15 First-Class, 23 List A and 29 T20 games for Maharashtra. The all-rounder is a handy lower-order batter and is economical with his right-arm medium pace. Ranjane ended his career in Indian cricket with Goa in 2022. He was picked by Rajasthan Royals in the 2019 auctions but never received an IPL cap."

The move had been widely tipped, with Smith having signed as a brand ambassador for Freedom last year, and with Australia's international schedule allowing a clear window for him to participate through July.\n\nNew South Wales (NSW), Smith's domestic team in Australia, have a high-performance partnership with Freedom, although NSW coach Greg Shipperd was replaced by Ricky Ponting in February.\n\n\"I'm super excited about joining the Washington Freedom for season two of the MLC,\" Smith said in a video posted on the Freedom's social media channels. \"I can't wait to meet all of my new team-mates and play in front of some incredible crowds in America. I'm also really looking forward to working with Ricky Ponting again, and his amazing staff.\"\n\nFreedom recently announced the signing of Rachin Ravindra, the New Zealand allrounder. They retained two overseas players from the 2023 season in Marco Jansen and Akeal Hosein.\n\nSmith, who owns an apartment in New York, has previously said it would be \"pretty cool\" to play in the USA.\n\nHowever, he faces a fight to earn a spot in Australia's final 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup, which will be held in June, having been unable to play much T20 cricket in recent times. Since his prolific return to the BBL for Sydney Sixers in the 2022-23 season, where he made 346 runs at a strike rate of 174.74, Smith has played two T20Is in India, two matches in last season's BBL and as many games against New Zealand in February, where he made 11 and 4 while opening the batting.\n\nBut after the New Zealand series, he said he was relaxed about whichever way the selection call for the T20 World Cup fell, with Australia having to name their initial squad by May 1.\n\nRelated\n\nMaxwell signs with Washington in MLC, clarifies that form was the reason for IPL self-omission\n\nTravis Head joins Steven Smith at Washington Freedom for Major League Cricket 2024\n\nPonting confirmed as Washington Freedom head coach in MLC\n\nTexas Super Kings snap up Mitchell; Shepherd goes to MI New York\n\nHundred faces MLC clash as 2024 fixtures are announced\n\n\"I think they're pretty settled up top - to be honest - with [Travis] Head, [David] Warner and [Mitchell] Marsh in the top three,'' he had told AAP. \"I'm not really sure what [selectors] want to do. I'm not really too fussed either way. If I'm there, I'm there; if I'm not, I'm not.\"\n\nSmith joins Adam Zampa (Los Angeles Knight Riders), Spencer Johnson (Knight Riders) and Tim David (MI New York) as confirmed Australian signings for the second season of MLC, with more expected to join for the tournament which starts immediately after the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies ends on June 29."

Texas Super Kings are co-owned by Chennai Super Kings owners, while LA Knight Riders are co-owned by Bollywood actors Juhi Chawla, Shahrukh Khan and the MI New York co-owned by the Reliance group. Satya Nadella co-owns the Seattle Orcas.\n\nThe inaugural game between Texas Super Kings and LA Knight Riders witnessed over 7500 attendees thronging towards the venue in Dallas, TX. Some of the players who played at the inaugural match included Faf Du Plessis, Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, David Miller, Dwayne Bravo et al, while LA Knight Riders had Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Jason Roy (not present for the inaugural game), Lockie Ferguson, Adam Zampa among others.\n\nThe game turned really interesting with the home crowd cheering for Texas Super Kings who eventually won the game. Many first timers turned up to understand the game and felt it was worth coming down to the stadium.\n\nThe first season will be played for 17 days, where the initial two rounds will be played in Dallas, TX and Morisville, NC. The teams come back to Dallas, TX and lock each other in the eliminators, play-offs and the final that will be played on Sunday, July 30th.\n\nThe audience felt extremely with the preparations made by City of Grand Prairie who own the ground and reminisced good old days. They opined that they have their version of IPL happening in the US and thanked MLC."

I had to be brave and it worked for me.\"\n\nNew Zealander Boult was the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 22 wickets at an average of 10.36.\n\nUSA international Cameron Gannon, who finished as MLC's second-highest wicket with 11 wickets at 17.36 for Seattle, was named domestic player of the tournament.\n\n\"The quality has been exceptional,\" said Australia-born Gannon.\n\n\"Having overseas players and playing this tournament has been so much fun. I think it is going to be fantastic for USA cricket moving forward.\"\n\nAfter several false dawns, cricket finally looks well placed to establish itself in the United States, spearheaded by its flagship T20 franchise tournament.\n\nAttendances at the two venues have encouraged organisers, with curious American sports fans drawn to the tournament in addition to vast swathes of the South Asian diaspora.\n\nMLC's efforts to gain prominence in the US have also been boosted by some influential names.\n\nSatya Nadella, the chairman and chief executive of Microsoft and co-owner of the Seattle Orcas, bowled the ceremonial first ball before the final at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nFormer India captain Sunil Gavaskar was on hand to award the trophy while Nita Ambani, co-owner of the Mumbai Indians, celebrated with New York's players and posed for selfies with some of the 8,000 fans in attendance.\n\nIndia's prime minister, Narendra Modi even mentioned cricket's growth in the US at a state dinner attended by President Joe Biden at the White House recently.\n\n\"The US has emphatically shown the rest of the cricket world that it is capable of successfully hosting cricket of the highest calibre,\" MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport after the final.\n\n\"To hear from the fans and the players who came to MLC this season on how much it exceeded their expectations, and more importantly, that they can't wait to be back next season is both humbling and energising at once.\n\n\"I can't think of another sport that has come out of the gates like MLC has in the US - practically all matches sold out in both venues, amazing atmospheres and fans actually building allegiances to their home teams even though we are playing in just two venues.\n\n\"We are going to build on this incredible launch season to come back even better in 2024.\"\n\nMLC's founders have already indicated their desire to lure England's best players to the tournament in the future. Even though it clashes with the English summer it could prove hard to resist."

        "body": "THE SEATTLE Orcas secured a classy victory in Major League Cricket after defeating MI New York by two wickets at Church Street Park, Morrisville on Tuesday. Heinrich Klaasen scored the first-ever century of the MLC as he played a magnificent unbeaten knock of 110 runs off 44 balls to guide the Orcas to victory in a high-scoring match.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas won the toss and elected to bowl first. MI New York had a shaky start to their innings, as opener Monank Patel (2) lost his wicket cheaply by the third over. Shayan Jahangir (19) soon followed him back to the pavilion as he failed to build on his start.\n\nNew York was struggling to put runs on the board as Hammad Azam (2) lost his wicket in the seventh over soon after MI had crossed the 50-run mark. Nicholas Pooran and Captain of MI New York, Kieron Pollard constructed a crucial partnership that steadied the ship for their team.\n\nNew York came back roaring back into the game thanks to Pooran (68), who lost his wicket in the thirteenth over after scoring a blistering half-century and guiding his team past 100 runs. Pollard (34) lost his wicket in the following over as the scores for MI New York read 132 runs for the loss of 5 wickets.\n\nA steady partnership between Tim David and David Wiese saw New York go past 150 runs. However, Tim David (18) failed to build on his solid start as he lost his wicket at the start of the eighteenth over. Rashid Khan (2) lost his wicket cheaply in the subsequent over soon after which Wiese (19) followed suit.\n\nNosthush Kenjige (3) and Trent Boult (20) scored 22 runs in the final over of their team’s innings that saw MI New York end their 20 overs with a total of 194 runs for the loss of eight wickets. Imad Wasim and Harmeet Singh picked up two wickets each for the Seattle Orcas, while Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye picked up a wicket each.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas had a decent start to the second innings, but Quinton de Kock (9) failed to build a fruitful partnership with Nauman Anwar as he lost his wicket at the start of the fourth over. Shehan Jayasuriya (0) followed de Kock back to the pavilion at the start of the sixth over as he failed to trouble the scorers.\n\nNauman Anwar and in-form Heinrich Klaasen carefully constructed a partnership that helped the Orcas cross the 50-run mark in the eighth over. Anwar (51) scored a crucial half-century before he lost his wicket in the eleventh over right as the Orcas were on the cusp of crossing the 100-run mark.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen was anchoring the Orcas innings, while wickets were falling around him. Shubham Ranjane (7) lost his wicket cheaply in the thirteenth over and was soon followed by Dasun Shanaka (10) back to the pavilion. While Klaasen scored a stunning half-century, Dwaine Pretorious (2) lost his wicket at the start of the eighteenth over.\n\nImad Wasim (0) and Harmeet Singh (0) had lost their wickets by the end of the eighteenth over without troubling the scorers. Going into the final two overs of the second inning, the Orcas still needed 19 runs to win as the game was headed for a nail-biting finish.\n\nSpearheading the attack for the Orcas, Klaasen scored the first-ever century in Major League Cricket. As the game entered its final over, Seattle needed six runs to win and the Orcas pulled off a triumph thanks to a game-winning six by Klaasen off the second ball of the nineteenth over.\n\nKlaasen remained unbeaten with 110 runs off 44 balls as he single-handedly led the Orcas to victory. Trent Boult bowled superbly and picked up four wickets for MI New York, while Rashid Khan picked up two wickets. David Wiese and Nosthush Kenjige chipped in with one wicket each."

        "date": "Fri Jul 14 06:08:53 2023",
        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) could become the biggest T20 franchise tournament in the world behind the Indian Premier League (IPL), Liam Plunkett says.\n\nTexas Super Kings thrashed Los Angeles Knight Riders by 69 runs in the opening match in Dallas.\n\nFormer England fast bowler Plunkett, poised to make his debut for San Francisco Unicorns on Friday, has predicted a bold future for MLC.\n\n\"It can be right up there just behind the IPL,\" Plunkett told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Obviously it will be hard to overtake the IPL but MLC is being taken very seriously and America is the biggest place in the world for sport.\n\n\"Let's see where that ceiling is. Nobody knows and that's the exciting part, it is unknown. There's huge potential.\"\n\nThe USA's new T20 cricket league consists of a 19-game season played over two and a half weeks and features six teams - MI New York, Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, Seattle Orcas, San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom.\n\nWith seasoned T20 franchise and international players on show in Dallas, the cricket in the curtain raiser between the Super Kings and the Knight Riders was of a high calibre, and with no lack of passion on the field.\n\nSuper Kings captain Faf du Plessis fell for a first-ball duck on his birthday before Devon Conway (55) and David Miller (61) got their side to 181-6 as Lockie Ferguson claimed 2-23.\n\nAndre Russell (55) spearheaded the Knight Riders response after a top-order collapse, but when he fell to Dwayne Bravo, the game was up for the LA franchise as they were dismissed for 112 in 14 overs.\n\nUS left-arm wrist spinner Mohammad Mohsin finished with an impressive 4-8 for the Texas franchise.\n\nThe paint was barely dry on the 7,000-capacity Grand Prairie Stadium - the former home of the Texas Airhogs baseball team - after the finishing touches were put on a $20m redevelopment in the hours leading up to a highly anticipated opening fixture.\n\nThere had been a strong American feel to the build-up - the Super Kings players had posed for publicity photos in stetson hats, and the national anthem was played before the match - as is traditional at sports events in the USA.\n\nBut as the sun set and floodlights took over, the night air was filled the sound of whistles and bhangra drums. It looked and sounded more like Delhi than Dallas.\n\nBy the time of the first ball was bowled by USA national team bowler Ali Khan at 19:30 local time on Thursday (01:30 BST on Friday) the venue, officially sold out, was around two-thirds full.\n\nThe majority of the crowd were wearing or waving the yellow of the Super Kings, who are co-owned by their Chennai namesakes.\n\nMLC has some significant backers, including Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, and the organisers have made no secret of their desire to tap into the Indian diaspora numbering 4.6 million in the US.\n\nMany are eager to be associated with the tournament. Australia's Steve Smith, known for his savvy business decisions, announced on Wednesday that he had joined Washington Freedom as a brand ambassador., external\n\nPlunkett, who won the World Cup with England in 2019 before relocating to Philadelphia with his American wife, believes the development and growth of MLC could have lucrative spin-offs for cricketers by connecting them to the US.\n\nThe 38-year-old said: \"Away from cricket, there are all sorts of different sponsorships and partnerships. Who knows where that is going to take some of the superstars of the game?\n\n\"When Americans get excited about something, they go above and beyond. Like the Indians, they are very passionate. With these players coming across, it shows there's a massive excitement. They want to be here because if it takes off, it could be huge.\""

        "title": "A new cricket league is underway in the busy US sports market. Organizers believe it can stick",
        "date": "Thu Jul 20 10:00:06 2023",
        "body": "GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) — “Deep in the Heart of Texas” blared from the speakers during a timeout a few days into the debut of a U.S. professional cricket league near Dallas.\n\nFans waved the flags of the Texas Super Kings and the LA Knight Riders, with some wearing the jerseys of their favorite countries or clubs overseas. A couple had ballcaps of two of the biggest brands in the United States — the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys and Major League Baseball’s New York Yankees.\n\nThis unusual confluence comes during the debut of Major League Cricket, which is hoping to find a foothold for one of the world’s most popular sports in a sports-mad country that knows little about the “other” bat-and-ball game.\n\nBecause of a willing partner happy to see a fading minor league baseball stadium turned into one of the few legitimate cricket pitches in the country, the league made its start in Texas, famous for the Friday night lights of high school football. The 7,000-seat stadium is in Grand Prairie, not far from where the Cowboys — America’s Team, remember — play in front of 90,000-plus eight or nine times every fall under a retractable roof with a giant video board hanging over the field.\n\n“Some days I think we’re crazy,” tournament director Justin Geale said. “We’re in the middle of Dallas and we’ve got a cricket ground. I saw the vision. I got very excited. I got goose bumps when I first came in here. I thought, ‘We can do this.’”\n\nAs with many things, money is the key, and co-founder Sameer Mehta said investors behind the initial $120 million aren’t expecting to turn a profit for several years, if then. Much of the money is coming from India, where arguably the best T20 cricket — the three-hour version that most closely resembles baseball — is played in the India Premier League. Three IPL owners are helping run U.S. teams.\n\nWith a salary cap that’s competitive with similar T20 tournaments around the world, Major League Cricket organizers secured most of the better-known players they pursued, including Texas Super Kings captain Faf du Plessis.\n\nThe South African was swarmed by autograph seekers during a match against Washington when his playing time was finished. There are U.S. players as well on rosters that allow six spots for international veterans. Mehta said he had no concerns about the quality of play even without IPL players because of rules preventing them from being here.\n\n“There’s some bloody good players out there, especially with the IPL owning some of the franchises here, they bring across some international players,” said Australia’s Matthew Short, the player of the match for Washington in a victory over Texas. “As the tournament gets on the next couple of years, I think it’s important we get those players here and really bring up the local guys here as well.”\n\nPriyank Shah, a native of India who has been working and studying in the U.S. for six years, shouted toward the players he recognized as they walked to and from the locker room. There were plenty of them.\n\n“Besides Indian players, the other players who are playing here, they are like rock stars,” said Shah, who lives in the Dallas area, the metropolitan region that is seeing explosive growth in its Asian population.\n\nThe first eight matches in the six-team tournament were in Texas, with seven more set for Morrisville, North Carolina. The event returns to the Dallas area for elimination games, with the championship July 30.\n\nFor now, the league’s six cities — Washington, Seattle, New York and San Francisco included — are merely represented by the players. The goal is a home-and-home league, with 30 matches per team spanning roughly two months, but that’s several years off. Mehta said the clubs are contractually obligated to open venues within five years.\n\nThe 2024 plan calls for another tournament format, perhaps with two more venues. And organizers hope to build off the T20 World Cup, which will be held in part in the U.S. for the first time.\n\nGeale is hopeful cricket will be added as an Olympic sport for 2028, when the Games are in Los Angeles.\n\n“All of a sudden, we’ve got this five-year growth program for the sport,” Geale said. “A big part of what we’re trying to do is strengthen the USA national team.”\n\nAnother part of the growth plan is more grass roots, which Mehta said will take time. Youth and recreational leagues will be crucial to the U.S. becoming more competitive internationally.\n\nAnd while Houston has a strong enough presence in cricket to have hosted training camps leading to the Major League Cricket debut, the league will need similar facilities in the six cities with teams.\n\n“The odds are stacked against us,” Geale said. “We’re trying to launch a new sport in a country that doesn’t know it needs it. I think we need to be realistic. But I think if we can showcase how cool we think the game is, if we can put out a really good TV product, we can get that to people in America and the world to show this is going to work.”\n\nThere are plenty of examples of how Geale and Mehta want to “Americanize” the sport. One of the best is the ball going into the stands for the cricket version of a home run — all of them are homers since the game is played over all 360 degrees of a circular field.\n\nBaseball fans are used to keeping those balls. Cricket fans are conditioned to throw them back because of the “sanctity of play is that the same ball has to be used unless of course (it’s) out of shape,” Mehta said.\n\nOne day, Geale would love for fans to keep the balls. For now, he was worried about that for the debut — but didn’t need to be. Fans promptly tossed the balls back, which made sense considering what Mehta said about marketing. The target for the debut was ex-patriots of countries in South Asia and the Caribbean, along with Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThat’s another part of the short-term plan.\n\n“What I would love to do is for these fans to quickly bring their friends, family, associates, colleagues along to a game and have them sample this,” Mehta said. “But it’s OK if it takes another year. And by next year, we’ll be doing a lot of general marketing, trying to reach out to mainstream American sports fans.”\n\nThere were a few of those fans in the tournament’s first few days, including Dan Strick. The Dallas-area resident who got hooked on cricket through TV about a year ago brought his son to see a match.\n\n“Based on a year and half of experience, I’ve only watched the best teams in the world play,” Strick said. “So obviously this might be a little poorer. But it’s still fun.”\n\n___"

        "body": "Watch: Pakistan-born American leg spinner Mohammad Mohsin picked two wickets off two balls, one of which involved pinning MI New York captain Kieron Pollard plumb in front first ball, to lead Texas Super Kings’ defence of 154.\n\nBatting first after winning the toss, Texas Super Kings had put up 154-7 at the Grand Prairie Stadium. Devon Conway led the way, scoring 74 off 55 balls, while Faf du Plessis was bowled off a high full toss by Kagiso Rabada for eight. Mitchell Santner chipped in with a crucial 13-ball knock of 27 towards the end.\n\nNew York lost opener Monank Patel for a duck but recovered quickly to set up a solid platform to launch towards the end. They brought down the target to 64 in 42 balls with seven wickets in hand.\n\nMohsin had bowled two overs by then, for 26 runs, 18 of which came in his second over – the 10th of the innings. Shayan Jahangir and Tim David were at the crease when he came on to bowl his third – the 14th of the innings.\n\nJahangir failed to score off the first ball, and stepped out to hit the second. He ended up missing the ball and was stumped by a huge margin.\n\nThat wicket brought New York captain Pollard to the crease. Pollard has a weakness against balls targeted at the stumps by leg spinners. Mohsin played on that weakness, and caught him plumb in front of the very next ball, denting New York’s chances significantly.\n\nHe ended up giving just two runs in that over and gave eight more in his fourth to finish with figures of 2-36. Texas won by 17 runs, a major reason for which turned out to be Mohsin’s double-wicket over.\n\nWatch Mohammad Mohsin take two in two, including pinning Pollard first ball to dent MI New York’s chances:"

        "title": "Kieron Pollard: No league rivals the IPL – but Major League Cricket can have an impact",
        "date": "Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Kieron Pollard has played in, by the best count, 10 Twenty20 leagues around the world. Now, he is about to play in his 11th: Major League Cricket, the first major T20 league in the United States. The tournament launched in the early hours of Friday morning, when Texas Super Kings beat Los Angeles Knight Riders in front of a sold-out 7,000 crowd at a converted baseball stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nThe team names on opening night - the Super Kings and Knight Riders - reflect the involvement of the Indian Premier League in Major League Cricket. IPL owners own four of the MLC teams - including MI New York, who are named after Mumbai Indians are will play in the same blue kit, whom Pollard will captain.\n\n“All the excitement is there,” he says. “Getting people to come out and understand what’s cricket about in America had different challenges before with different tournaments. But this one, with the backing of the Indian franchises - they understand what needs to be done for a tournament to be successful.”\n\nPollard has played in the US before for West Indies against India and in the Caribbean Premier League, at Fort Lauderdale in Florida. Though the India matches attracted sell-out crowds, the CPL games suffered underwhelming crowds, with fans put off by a lack of shade on suffocatingly hot days.\n\nYet this time, Pollard, believes, will be different. The creation of Minor League Cricket, a feeder league for MLC, two years ago has helped to begin the long process of nurturing American talent. The involvement of IPL franchises also gives MLC greater credibility. It has also ensured that MLC’s raft of overseas players is more impressive than the Hundred: Jason Roy, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway are among those playing, earning salaries up to £135,000 for the 18-day tournament.\n\nNo league, Pollard is sure, will compete with the behemoth of the IPL. But he believes that MLC can slot into the next tier of leagues.\n\n“I don’t think any one of the leagues can rival the IPL if it was very, very honest. With the right structures in place, I think they can be a force to be reckoned with because American sports is big in the world.”\n\nPollard knows the pitfalls of T20 leagues better than most. He played in the Global T20 Canada in 2018, which was since scrapped because of funding problems, and has seen a host of mooted T20 leagues never even make it to the first ball. The involvement of IPL owners - the two other franchises have investment from Cricket New South Wales and Cricket Victoria - gives him confidence that MLC will prove altogether more sustainable.\n\n“It’s about the future,” he says. “It is not just ‘put on a league I want to make a quick buck’. You just want to go there for the long haul, understanding the dynamics of the country, understanding who and what is needed to run the league for a period of time, the quality of the cricket, the quality of the overseas stars, the template of the tournament, and what you’re trying to achieve.\n\n“Hopefully with the influence of the IPL franchises, which have been successful for the last 15 years, they understand the model and it continues to grow.”\n\nFew players grasp this like Pollard, who has played more T20 matches than anyone in history and - now a coach in the IPL, but a player everywhere else - is gently winding down his remarkable career. Even more than his one T20 World Cup in 2012, and five IPL crowns with Mumbai Indians, Pollard’s greatest legacy is as a pioneer.\n\nIn 2010, Pollard rejected a central contract from West Indies to play with Somerset in the T20 Blast instead - effectively, choosing to become a freelance cricketer. One West Indies administrator asked Pollard: “Do you want to be remembered as a legend or do you want to be remembered as someone who is a mercenary?”\n\nNow, of course, administrators are rather more enlightened when players - as Pollard did - make decisions based on what is best for their families. When Jason Roy opted out of his England contract to play in this season’s MLC, England immediately clarified that the decision would not affect their willingness to pick him for international cricket.\n\nPollard stresses, “I’ve never turned down playing for West Indies to play franchise cricket.” Indeed, he played 224 times for West Indies across the two white-ball formats, including a stint as captain from 2019-22.\n\n“Hopefully one day they realise the mistakes they’ve made with the words that they chose,” Pollard reflects of how his embrace of freelance life was viewed. When it is put to him that he was ahead of his time, he says: “we understood the nature of where the sport was going and how things were happening, especially in the Caribbean.\n\n“Now I sit back and I see it’s the way of the world. Because as individuals, we have short careers and you have to think about the future and think about what’s right in front of you.”\n\nWhile Pollard grew up hoping to play Test cricket and actually has a far better first-class average - 37.7 - than many West Indies batsmen picked in recent years, he is fully content with how his career panned out. “I look at things as what is to be will be - and that was something that was not meant to be. I don’t actually lose sleep over it. It didn’t happen due to different circumstances.”\n\nAs West Indies white-ball captain until last year, Pollard still believes that the side can chart a way forward after the debacle of failing to qualify for this year’s ODI World Cup. It needs “everybody coming together,” he says. “The right thinking, the right people, the right strategy, the right plan, and the dedication.\n\n“There’s still a lot of people interested in playing cricket there’s still a lot of youngsters I see them. I interact with them. They need a right and clear pathway in order for that to happen.” For most young Caribbean cricketers, the template of Pollard’s career is altogether more relevant than that of the magnificent generation of Test players in the 1980s.\n\nPollard was one of the very first to spot where the game was heading; his career responded to - and then accelerated - these shifts. To him, MLC is merely another sign of cricket’s continued move towards a structure more like football, with the game revolving more around domestic leagues than the international game.\n\n“I think it’ll carry on going more to franchise cricket,” he reflects. “The leagues and the franchises are going to have a lot more influence - because you have leagues basically 12 months a year.”\n\n“I’m happy it has gotten to this stage and people have realised that T20 cricket is actually here to stay.” Few men have done more than Pollard to ensure that is so.\n\nKieron Pollard is an Investor and Ambassador for Me + U."

Off-pace on a length on middle and off. de Kock looks to tonk it into tomorrow but does not pick the variation. Swings too early and the ball crashes into middle stump, leaving it flattened! What an innings this has been from de Kock, though - it has set the Orcas up beautifully!. 142 / 4\n\n18.1 to SS Ranjane , one brings two! Off-pace on a back of a length outside off. Ranjane tries to smash the cover off the ball and loses his shape completely. He is early into the stroke too and that means he slices it tamely to backward point. Kenjige judges it well and gobbles up the chance!. 157 / 6\n\n18.5 to AJ Tye , Tye bites the dust! Knuckle-ball on a length just outside off. Tye tries to be funky and looks for the scoop. He has no pace to work with, though, and the ball spoons up off his bat straight to Jessy at short fine leg.

Massive, massive moment in the game! Length delivery just outside off and this seems to stick in the surface. Klaasen tries to mow it over cow corner but he has not quite gotten to the pitch of this.

        "body": "New Zealand opener Finn Allen was comically run out during the San Francisco Unicorns’ 35-run loss to the Seattle Orcas in Major League Cricket on Sunday morning.\n\nThe 24-year-old got San Francisco’s run chase off to an explosive start at Texas’ Grand Prairie Stadium, slapping 28 runs from his first nine deliveries. He plundered five boundaries from Seattle captain Wayne Parnell’s opening over, including a glorious six over long-on.\n\nAfter combining with wicketkeeper Matthew Wade for a 42-run opening partnership, Allen fended a length delivery from West Australian seamer Cameron Gannon towards mid-wicket for what should have been a comfortable single.\n\nAllen leisurely jogged towards the non-striker’s end, only for Orcas fielder Shehan Jayasuriya to retrieve the ball and fling it at the stumps. The right-hander attempted to slide his bat, but instead dropped it short of the crease – replays confirmed he had been run out, gone for 28 (10).\n\nUnicorns captain Aaron Finch was not impressed with the dismissal, failing to hide his frustration from the dugout.\n\n“What’s going on here?” former Glamorgan all-rounder Alan Wilkins cried in commentary.\n\n“He can’t believe it … look at that, what’s he doing?

(WNCN) — Thousands of fans crowded into Church Street Park in Morrisville Monday evening for another sellout at a Major League Cricket match.\n\nThe league, in its first season, has had full attendance in all of its games in both Texas and North Carolina.\n\n“These are the biggest games that’ll happen out here. 70-80 of the world’s best players in a very, very intimate setting, everyone close together, fans enjoying it. This is a dream come true for us,” said Sameer Mehta, the co-founder of MLC.\n\nPeople from across the country and world are in the Triangle for these matches. One fan held up a sign during Monday’s matchup saying they had come from Canada.\n\nWith the stands filled, dozens of fans even gathered outside the park, looking through a fence in hopes of catching even a glimpse of the action.\n\n“Someone who loves the sport, has played the sport for a long time, this is phenomenal,” said Sanjay Pal.\n\nPal has lived in the Triangle since the 1990s, helping to grow cricket locally since then.\n\n“Actually right next to this is the original field, which is called the Shiloh Cricket Field, which some of us helped build. And then I was fortunate enough to run the cricket league in the area for a couple of years in 2000-2001, and then it’s just taken off since then,” Pal said.\n\nCricket captures the hearts of many across different corners of the globe. Fans and organizers are hopeful the U.S. and Morrisville won’t be any different.\n\n“This version of cricket we play takes about three to four hours a game, and you will see a lot of families, younger families come together. That’s kind of the next evolution of cricket from the traditional cricket that’s been there for hundreds of years,” said Pal.\n\n“If we had a larger stadium we’d sell that out, if we had a stadium five times the size, we’d sell that out. The community out here is passionate about the sport, and they know a good product when they see one,” Mehta added.\n\nMLC will have its final match in Morrisville Tuesday night before returning to Texas for the remainder of the season."

Operated by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) and sanctioned by USA Cricket, it began play on July 13, 2023, with six teams representing major US cities under a single-entity model.[1] The first season took place over three weeks at Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, concluding on July 30, 2023.[2][3] In 2021, the development league for MLC, Minor League Cricket (MiLC), completed its inaugural season, which was contested by 27 franchise-based teams.[4]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThere have been various attempts to hold a Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in the United States, such as the short-lived Pro Cricket (which played a single season in 2004),[5] and the American Premier League, a proposed league in partnership between the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) and New Zealand Cricket, modelled after domestic T20 competitions. However, it has yet to properly launch in the United States as of February 2024.\n\nFormation: 2018–2021[edit]\n\nIn November 2018, USA Cricket announced that it was seeking partners to establish a domestic T20 league in the country by 2021, with goals to \"engage existing fans and grow new ones\", and spur \"sustainable development of cricketing infrastructure across the United States\".[5] In May 2019, USA Cricket accepted a bid by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) for a US$1 billion investment, covering the league and other investments benefitting the US national teams. Its partners include Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain of The Times Group, and Willow TV founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan.[6][7] As part of the agreement, ACE also handles commercial activities for T20I and ODI matches hosted by the United States.[8]\n\nIn January 2019, USA Cricket was approved as the new governing board for cricket in USA,[9] replacing the USACA, which had been expelled from the International Cricket Council in September 2017 due to governance issues.[10] The new body set a goal for cricket to reach wider, mainstream popularity in the country, where it has typically been considered a niche international sport.[11][12]\n\nIn an annual general meeting on February 21, 2020, it was stated that USA Cricket planned to launch Major League Cricket in 2021, and a 22-team development league known as Minor League Cricket that summer as a prelude.[13] Minor League Cricket was officially announced the following week, with plans to host a nine-week, 170-game season beginning July 4;[14] however, it was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[15][16]\n\nIn October 2020, USA Cricket reaffirmed plans to launch Major League Cricket in 2022 as part of its \"foundational plan\" for 2020–23.[17] On December 1, 2020, it was announced that the IPL's Kolkata Knight Riders (co-owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan) would invest in ACE.[18][19]\n\nIn February 2021, MLC announced plans for Minor League Cricket Youth and Major League Cricket Youth leagues, which would, alongside a MLC Jr. Championship and player development program, serve as a development system for younger players to progress towards Major League Cricket and the national team.[20] In May 2021, the launch of Major League Cricket was delayed to 2023 due to COVID-19 and to provide additional time to develop facilities.[21]\n\nLaunch: 2022–2023[edit]\n\nIn May 2022, Major League Cricket announced it had acquired funds of US$120 million as part of its Series A and A1 fundraising rounds.[22] Investors committing to MLC featured the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Ross Perot Jr., Anand Rajaraman, Shantanu Narayen and more.[23] MLC plans to use these funds to mainly build stadiums and first-class facilities in the hopes of accelerating cricket's development across the United States.[24][25]\n\nIn June 2022, MLC announced the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket Youth (MiLC Youth).[26] The inaugural season of MiLC Youth was announced to be contested between eleven teams at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in Houston starting July 25, 2022.[27] The finals for the inaugural season took place on July 29 at between the Dallas Mustangs and the New Jersey Stallions,[28] in which the Stallions beat the Mustangs by two wickets.[29]\n\nIn November 2022, it was announced the first season of MLC will be staged from July 13–30, 2023, at Grand Prairie Stadium. The tournament will be played in a single round-robin format with 15 league matches played among six franchises before a four-match play-off phase. MLC also hopes to play matches in a to-be-constructed stadium in Los Angeles, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.[30]\n\nIn February 2023, it was announced that the player draft for the league's inaugural season would be held on March 19, 2023.[31]\n\nThe inaugural player draft was held on March 19, 2023, at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston.[32] The draft was conducted over 9 rounds via a serpentine system, where the team order is reversed every round.[33] Out of the 9 rounds, 8 were general draft picks, with the final round being exclusively for U-23 players.[34] Each of the six teams had a purse of over $1 million, with $800,000 for overseas players and $300,000 for US-based players.[35] The draft had a fixed salary cap with a maximum of $75,000 (first round) and a minimum of $2,500 (ninth round).[36] Overseas signings were directly signed and were not part of the draft.[37] Each franchise must have a minimum of fifteen players, with the maximum being eighteen. Out of these eighteen players, a maximum of nine can be overseas players.[38]\n\nFollowing the draft, it was reported that USAC had not yet sanctioned either Major or Minor League Cricket for the 2023 season, with the ICC stating that its members should not issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to release players to participate at this time.

        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) finally got underway in the United States last week after several false starts, fuelling hopes that the sport is poised to break new ground in a huge new market on the back of the popular Twenty20 format.\n\nFive years after USA Cricket shared its plans to launch a domestic T20 tournament, the inaugural edition of the MLC kicked off having assembled an impressive array of investors. Four of its six franchises are owned by business entities which also own teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the money-spinning standard bearer of franchise cricket.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is co-owner of the MLC's Seattle franchise, while Washington and San Francisco franchises have strategic partnerships with the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria. While franchise-based competitions are springing up all around the world, Tom Dunmore, MLC's marketing vice president, said the U.S. competition cannot be dismissed as \"just another T20 league\".\n\n\"We're building stadiums and youth academies, we're building training centres and bringing in coaches and players,\" he told Reuters from Dallas. \"Those will be available for the USA national teams as well.\n\n\"It's not really like other T20 leagues that are using existing facilities in cricket-mad countries.\" While cricket remains a niche sport in the U.S. it has been around for a long time in the country - the first international cricket match took place in New York in 1844 with the United States taking on Canada.\n\nThe MLC could be cricket's vehicle to break into a sporting landscape dominated by baseball, basketball and American football, said Dunmore. \"We're cracking a new market for the sport,\" he added.\n\n\"Cricket hasn't really broken into a major new market for some time. So this is a chance not only to do that, but to do it in the world's biggest commercial market.\" Dunmore said cricket's existing fan base in the U.S. made it the sport's fifth-largest market.\n\n\"If we slice off even a small percentage of the rest of the population, you've got a massive market.\" West Indies' Kieron Pollard, one of the first players to fully embrace franchise cricket, was confident MLC would take cricket \"prime-time\" in the U.S., even though others had failed to break open the market.\n\n\"Obviously before MLC, different people have tried different things,\" the 36-year-old, who leads the league's New York franchise, told Reuters. \"But now the difference is the backing of the Indian franchises and the international players that are coming.\"\n\n'THE BUZZ' Success on the global stage would help boost cricket's profile in the United States, and while there has been no big breakthrough as yet Pollard said they are getting closer.\n\nA U.S. team featuring players mostly of Indian origin made it to the 50-overs World Cup qualifiers in June but failed to make the cut for the main tournament in India later this year. But the experience of rubbing shoulders with the likes of former South Africa captain Faf du Plessis and England international Jason Roy would stand them in good stead, Pollard said.\n\n\"It augurs well for USA cricket, and hopefully the young talent that is there in America can use this opportunity to grow into better international cricketers,\" he added. Co-hosting the T20 World Cup next year with West Indies will also give the game a boost in the United States.\n\nThe launch of the MLC assumes even more importance coming at a time when the International Cricket Council (ICC) is lobbying for the game's Olympic inclusion at the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Dunmore said the MLC was providing cricket much-needed visibility as the game bids to return to the Olympics for the first time since 1900.\n\n\"The crowds and the excitement, the buzz, the media attention both in the US and globally, now that's truly helpful,\" he added. ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice acknowledged the buzz MLC has created in the United States.\n\n\"There are a number of developments in the U.S. that are helping to raise awareness of the game, the start of the MLC is one of them, they draw a lot of attention to the sport,\" Allardice said last week.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

        "date": "Tue Jul 27 15:19:12 2021",
        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) announced today the establishment of a new Major League Cricket Center at Tollgate Farm Park, with installation of the first natural turf cricket pitches in the Seattle area. The ground is the home base for the Major League Cricket Academy Seattle, serving more than 200 youth cricketers playing in the Seattle Youth Cricket League.\n\nStarting in the 2022 season, the Center will also be the home of the Seattle Thunderbolts. The Thunderbolts begin play this summer in the Toyota Minor League Cricket Championship presented by SLING TV, a national Twenty20 cricket competition for 27 city-based teams from across the United States.\n\nThe center features two grounds for both adult and youth play. Three turf wickets are located on each ground, allowing for season-long play. More than 200,000 pounds of natural clay have been installed, specially purposed for the northwestern climate.\n\n“The establishment of Seattle’s Major League Cricket Center is another important step in the development of first-class training and playing facilities accelerating the rapid development of cricket across all levels in the United States,” said Jagan Nemani, Head of Major League Cricket Academies. “The Tollgate Farm Park facility will offer outstanding natural turf pitch playing conditions for Seattle’s aspiring youth and adult cricketers, serving as the home of the Seattle Thunderbolts in Minor League Cricket. I would also like to convey our gratitude to Suraj Viswanathan, USA Cricket board director, who volunteered to oversee the logistics of clay shipments and coordinate with city officials on permits.”\n\n“With this significant investment in a first-class indoor and outdoor cricket center for the Seattle area, Major League Cricket has added another high-quality training and competition hub to support the growth of American cricket.” said Iain Higgins, CEO, USA Cricket. “USA Cricket looks forward to utilizing these outstanding facilities in the future for zonal and national training camps and matches.”\n\nTollgate Farm Park, located at 1300 W North Bend Way, North Bend, WA 98045, will offer one of the most scenic settings for cricket in the United States. With Mount Si as the backdrop to the cricket facility, the park offers stunning views of the surrounding Cascade Mountains, and the larger facility includes walking trails with interpretive signage highlighting the area’s rich history.\n\n“We are delighted to have such a beautiful ground with natural turf pitches as our home ground,” said Phani Chitneni, co-owner, Seattle Thunderbolts. “We are looking forward to hosting Minor League Cricket games at this venue from next year, building on the excitement from playing our inaugural season this summer and fall.”\n\nThe addition of the Tollgate Farm Park adds an outdoor facility to the Major League Cricket Center in Seattle that also includes an 11,000 square foot, state-of-the-art indoor facility located in Bellevue Wa., that opened in 2020. This premium training center includes five cricket lanes, fitness and agility training areas, skill development pods and a cricket store."

        "body": "Graham Manou certainly didn't think in cricket he'd ever find himself at NASA.\n\nYet the one-Test wicketkeeper, now Cricket Victoria high performance manager, was there at the Space Centre in Houston calling the shots prior to launch in March.\n\nIt was draft night in Texas for Major League Cricket's inaugural season – the United States' foray into T20 franchise cricket – and some of Australian cricket's most influential figures were right in the thick of it.\n\nA few days earlier, MLC tournament director Justin Geale – who was born in Canberra and grew up in Wagga Wagga, and later spent eight years in cricket operations at the Indian Premier League – was sat next to Manou, CV chief executive Nick Cummins, Victorian assistant coach Ben Rohrer and Cricket NSW Head of Male Cricket Michael Klinger watching America's best domestic talent at a 13-day draft combine.\n\nAmong them was Victorian and Melbourne Stars fast bowler Brody Couch, one of four 'Australian-American' prospects up for grabs in the draft.\n\n\"It was quite surreal,\" Geale recalls, \"we're sitting in Houston in the middle of nowhere at these six turf cricket fields just thinking 'we could be anywhere in the world, but we're all together, Australians here in Houston'.\n\n\"It's been a learning curve for them as well, a steep one when you come from somewhere like the Big Bash, which is now well established, really well run, well organised, promoted and defined, to something a bit new and unknown like this.\"\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nAfter South Africa (SA20) and the United Arab Emirates (International League T20), the US is set to become the third nation to launch a new domestic T20 league in 2023.\n\nGeale agrees \"there is too much cricket at the moment\", but he also believes the US has a significant advantage.\n\n\"We've got that clear window,\" he tells cricket.com.au from his home just outside of Chicago.\n\nImage Id: 01533D4F31544FCC8804590E0FF6E69A Image Caption: Geale (right) presents former England bowler Liam Plunkett his San Francisco cap on draft night // Supplied-MLC\n\n\"Around that Christmas time this year you had Big Bash, then there was the SA20, there was the UAE T20 going on, Nepal, Bangladesh, all these ones at the same times competing with the same players.\n\n\"Our summer here, we can play cricket a lot of the year round depending where in the country you are … down in Florida or LA you've got a longer season.\n\n\"Fundamentally, our summer is the opposite to a southern hemisphere summer so really it's the UK that we're going alongside.\n\n\"That window helps, we can generally get some of the best players in the world for two or three weeks to come over and play some really good cricket.\"\n\nStarting on July 13, the six MLC teams will play 19 games in 18 days mostly at Grand Prairie Stadium – a former baseball park that's been converted into the league's new 7200-seat purpose-built home near Dallas.\n\nIt's already attracting plenty of global superstars too, including Aaron Finch and Marcus Stoinis (San Francisco Unicorns), Mitch Marsh and Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas), and Anrich Nortje and Wanindu Hasaranga (Washington Freedom).\n\n\"As a kid growing up, we're pretty heavily influenced by American sport and culture, so I think there's a degree of curiosity about cricket in this market and the players are no different to us,\" Geale says.\n\n\"They're quite keen to come and see and do something new.\"\n\nAnother advantage according to Geale is the scale of commercial opportunity with sponsors and broadcasting in the US sports market.\n\nAnd while there have been previous attempts to establish a cricket competition in the USA – such as Pro Cricket in 2004 – this iteration has the backing of more than a dozen of America's most successful business leaders, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe chairman and CEO Shantanu Narayen.\n\nThree IPL franchises have also bought in – Los Angeles Knight Riders (Kolkata), MI New York (Mumbai Indians) and Texas Super Kings (Chennai), while GMR Group, the co-owner of the Delhi Capitals, have partnered with the Seattle Orcas.\n\n\"The level of investment we have, being privately funded out of Silicon Valley, you've got some pretty high-net-worth individuals … that are personally invested in this,\" Geale says.\n\n\"We'll be able to drive a really competitive salary cap and we're there from day one.\"\n\nWhy are Victoria and NSW involved?\n\nUnlike the four IPL teams who have extensive experience running a cricket program, the lead investors of the San Francisco and Washington franchises don't.\n\nImage Id: ECF6B3617AD24A7089E48C50568690F3 Image Caption: The six Major League Cricket teams for 2023 // Supplied-MLC\n\nUnicorns pair Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan are the founding partners at Milliways Ventures and Rocketship.vc, while Freedom's lead investor Sanjay Govil is the founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions and CEO of Zyter.\n\nBoth franchises were therefore looking to partner with an existing professional organisation to run their respective cricket departments and help with the recruitment of players and coaches, establish training, sports science and sports medicine programs, and facilitate match day operations.\n\nThat's where Cricket Victoria and Cricket NSW come in – with more than 130 years of delivering cricket in their respective states, they are San Francisco and Washington's high performance partners.\n\nIt's how Manou and Klinger found themselves at NASA on March 19 trying to build a roster for their respective teams having only laid eyes on most of the domestic talent over the preceding two weeks at the draft combine.\n\n\"The interesting part for us was that you felt at times perhaps we're going in very blind here,\" Manou tells cricket.com.au after returning to Melbourne. \"But heading across and seeing them play and being around the combine was certainly worth us going and doing that.\n\n\"We felt quite lucky in the way we thought the draft would play out in terms of what players would and wouldn't be available at different times was right, which probably suggests there was some clear bands in terms of the talent.\"\n\nKlinger adds: \"We did a lot of research before heading over with our analysts … (but) the four days of two matches each day (at the combine) definitely opened our eyes a little bit more.\"\n\nImage Id: 15DCB774C62E476CA4AE3D2B7A5C7EBF Image Caption: Klinger (front right) with the Washington Freedom franchise at the draft on March 19 // Supplied-MLC\n\nWhat's in it for the two states?\n\nIt's a fair question – how does partnering with a US-based franchise help with the success of NSW in the Marsh Sheffield Shield or the two Sydney clubs in the KFC BBL?\n\nBeyond the obvious links it establishes for players to be picked up by their state's MLC club, Geale believes most sporting organisations in Australia realise that a lot of the growth opportunities are offshore.\n\n\"It's another way for them to expand their footprint in a global cricket world, which is changing rapidly all the time,\" he says.\n\nAlong with establishing links for players, there will also be opportunities for coaches, physiotherapists, team operations staff and analysts from Victoria and NSW to get experience in a new environment.\n\n\"The cricket landscape is changing very quickly so to be directly involved in the way cricket's moving and part of the landscape that's T20 franchise cricket … it was obviously a very attractive tournament to be involved in,\" Klinger says.\n\nBut both states also understand their first obligation is ensuring their Australian players and squads are being serviced well.\n\n\"In the first year, we'll make it a relatively skeleton staff,\" Manou says.\n\n\"We've got some high-quality senior players in (former England fast bowler) Liam Plunkett and Corey Anderson (ex-New Zealand) who will no doubt play more than just playing role, both are equally as good as any leader that I've come across and have both shown a lot of interest in developing as coaches and getting involved in off field management as well.\"\n\nFor Geale and the sport in the US, the partnership goes beyond just Major League Cricket (which received official sanctioning from the governing body, USA Cricket, last month).\n\n\"Importantly, it opens up opportunities … I really think some of our younger players could benefit from six or eight weeks or a season in grade cricket, that's really going to elevate their cricket being around better cricketers,\" he says.\n\n\"That's one of the appeals for us with the Australian market and the season works nicely for that.\n\n\"The same as coaching staff, the same if you look beyond that at curators, at event operations staff, so that summer works nicely, a lot of six or seven-month jobs there, they can come over here for a few months.\"\n\nKlinger revealed NSW would also explore having a coach based in Washington or the US to work with their players weekly, while Manou says the Australian pathway system would also benefit from the relationship with potential opportunities for Premier cricketers to play in minor league teams.\n\nImage Id: AC4B2FE5F1EF43B3936CC8AE373452A5 Image Caption: Former Black Caps allrounder Anderson bowls at the draft combine // Supplied-MLC\n\n\"It might be playing a Premier Cricket season, it might be getting involved with one of our two BBL teams and training with them for a few weeks and being part of a really good set-up with two very experienced coaches in Greg Shipperd (Sydney Sixers) and Trevor Bayliss (Sydney Thunder), we're certainly looking at ways we can help those individuals become better cricketers, but also help cricket in America overall,\" Klinger says.\n\nThere are 'Australian-American' players?\n\nCameron Stevenson says he's never been one to get \"super nervous\" but as he sat in his office in Melbourne about midday on Monday, March 20 watching Geale announce each pick, he couldn't look and had to step away from his computer.\n\nHalf a world away at NASA, the United States' best players were up for grabs and Stevenson – by virtue of his mum's heritage – was one of the top prospects.\n\nAn engineer by day whose firm SPORTENG has been helping the MLC develop their new Grand Prairie Stadium, the 30-year-old says being part of the inaugural draft had the \"heart pounding\".\n\n\"I was too nervous to look once we started getting into the later rounds that I might not go, and I actually stepped away from my computer,\" Stevenson, who was part of Tasmania's list until 2018, recalls to cricket.com.au.\n\nImage Id: 0DB80F62F77C4E4788FD041326EB33A5 Image Caption: Stevenson celebrates a wicket on T20I debut for the USA last year // Twitter-@ZimCricketv\n\nBrody Couch – whose mum was also born in the US – was another watching along on YouTube from back home in Victoria, having just returned from the draft combine in Texas.\n\nFinally, in the sixth round, Geale read out Stevenson's name – pick 31 to the Texas Super Kings – and two picks later the Australian-American tournament director was back at the lectern announcing Couch's selection by the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nThe most experienced Aussie 'local' Cameron Gannon – who like the other two qualifies as a US domestic player due to his mum – had been picked up two rounds earlier by the Seattle Orcas, where he has been joined current West Australian teammate Mitch Marsh as an overseas recruit, though Marsh's availability for the tournament is now under threat due to his inclusion in Australia's Ashes squad.\n\nFormer Victorian and current Hampshire allrounder Ian Holland – who was born in the midwestern US state of Wisconsin – was the other 'Australian-American' in the draft pool, but he missed out on selection.\n\n\"It was a bit of relief in the end just to know that I'm going to be part of it all in the inaugural season,\" Couch says.\n\n\"I was definitely nervous at the time because I was hoping to go a bit sooner than I did but, when I heard my named called, I was just relieved.\"\n\nCouch – whose mum grew up on a dairy farm at Albany in upstate New York where her family still reside – had been at the combine from March 4-16, which he says helped him determine where he thought his ability was compared to the other local players.\n\nImage Id: 4C44CA85EB20414FAD9FC7DCA088C0F3 Image Caption: Couch in action for the Melbourne Stars in BBL|12 // Getty\n\n\"It was all completely new,\" the 23-year-old recalls, \"I had a roommate (Matthew Tromp, pick 49 to Seattle Orcas) who I'd never met before.\n\n\"It was a lot less structured and there was a big onus on myself just to put in what I wanted to get out of having that time over there.\n\n\"It was quite refreshing for me actually … being one of the very few Aussies over there at the time that I went, I put myself out of my comfort zone a little bit and built some connections with people who I probably never thought I would.\n\n\"The guys were really welcoming and just love their cricket … so it was no different to back here in that sense.\"\n\nWhat's the depth of American talent like?\n\n\"There's a lot more cricket in the US already than people realise,\" says Stevenson, who has played 18 ODIs and four T20Is for the USA owing to his mum being born Arizona and raised in California.\n\n\"There's definitely room for cricket over there and enough interest to build cricket in the US into something that's a little bit more mainstream than what it is now.\n\nImage Id: B2C662A17A5046E0A32BA096DBC8257A Image Caption: Stevenson is presented his T20I cap by South African-born USA fast bowler Rusty Theron // Twitter-@usacricket\n\n\"These guys are as good as I've seen in terms of raw talent. The ability that they've got is up there with any state cricketer that I've seen here.\n\n\"It's a really difficult environment to flourish as a cricketer because of the lack of first-class facilities and the level of competition historically hasn't been there to help these guys hone their game at a really high level.\"\n\nBoth Manou and Klinger admit they were \"pleasantly surprised\" at the skills on display from the local US players at the draft combine.\n\nThe fact that Gannon was drafted in the fourth round, and Couch and Stevenson – all who have played first-class cricket and in the Big Bash, with Stevenson also featuring for the US national team as recently as last September – were taken in the sixth round, attests to this.\n\nOnly eight of the 48 non-rookie players drafted to MLC teams haven't played first-class cricket and not even being a reigning ODI World Cup champion was enough to get Plunkett picked in the first round.\n\nAnd former New Zealand allrounder Anderson, former Indian under-19 captain Unmukt Chand, Plunkett, No.1 MLC draft pick Harmeet Singh and former Punjab leg-spinner Sarabjit Ladda all have IPL experience.\n\n\"The depth of talent is there, there's no doubt about that,\" Klinger says.\n\n\"There's a lot of ex-players from the subcontinent who've played international cricket or been part of IPL franchises or PSL (Pakistan Super League) franchises. There were players who had been in first-class systems in the subcontinent, first-class systems in South Africa, who left for different reasons.\n\n\"So there was definitely a positive feel about the quality that was there and that they'd be able to match it against some of our high quality overseas players as well.\"\n\nManou adds: \"There was certainly a band of players that could play and have played first-class cricket and there was quite a significant band of players that would easily fit into Premier first-grade across (Australia).\n\n\"It is and has been a bit of a sleeping giant there for a while. And hopefully this is the catalyst to make it grow.\"\n\nWith at least five players in each team's starting XI required to be domestic players, which is more than the two required in fellow associate nation the UAE's ILT20 tournament, that depth will be needed to ensure the quality of the product in its first season remains high.\n\nWith a maximum of six overseas recruits allowed in the XI and nine in the squad, along with 10 domestic players on the roster, each franchise was also required to pick a rookie from the under-23 age group in the ninth round of the draft.\n\n\"When I first got to America, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good the cricket was here, there's literally thousands of leagues played across the country,\" Geale says.\n\nImage Id: 4BF1E97364EF4FB1A7717ACA0620BEED Image Caption: New Zealand great and Chennai IPL coach Stephen Fleming will also coach the Texas Super Kings // Supplied-MLC\n\n\"What I was probably most disappointed or shocked at was the infrastructure and where we play. A lot of it is soccer fields, baseball diamonds, which aren't perfect, it's guys diving around with no faith in the outfield or councils that couldn't cut the grass any lower because baseball is 'this' height.\n\n\"It's taken three years to try and build a domestic program working with USA Cricket, working with the local leagues to try and build a pathway to the national team and to really give our domestic players the best chance.\n\n\"So when the major league comes around, it's got to be about the cricket, the cricket has got to be a good product.\n\n\"We can bring 'Finchy' and all the boys across but if the domestic players aren't up for it, it won't work. We're really confident that we've spent these three years building up our domestic programs, so the strength of the game from day one is going to be really good.\""

        "body": "Two of Steve Smith’s great loves, cricket and New York, are on course to collide after Cricket NSW sealed a deal with America’s Major League Cricket to provide opportunities for exchange and development for players and staff.\n\nWhile Smith will be unavailable for the inaugural MLC competition in July because of the Ashes, Cricket NSW CEO Lee Germon hopes a number of NSW players will have the chance to join the six franchises competing in the three-week Twenty20 tournament.\n\n“I think the opportunities for all of our players are going to be brilliant,” Germon said before Friday’s official announcement.\n\n“Steve absolutely has made no secret that he loves New York, but there are also two or three other players I’ve spoken to who would love to be able to play cricket in the United States.\n\n“We’re looking at every opportunity we can to grow the game, develop the game and promote the game and I think we saw with Steve this year coming back to play with the Sixers and the BBL, the impact he had.\n\n“So absolutely we’ll look to utilise the players within the New South Wales ecosystem to not only highlight the T20 competition and Major League Cricket, but also the development of cricket in that country as well.”\n\nSmith told the Herald and The Age in September that it would be “cool” to play cricket in New York.\n\n“I mean, yeah, there’s obviously [T20] leagues popping up everywhere around the world now, and I think you’ll probably see more players in the back end of their career going down that route, so it’s potentially something I’ll look at in the future,” Smith said. “There’s no reason why cricket can’t work [in the US], I wouldn’t think.\n\n“The US has been a market cricket has been trying to get into for some time. So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nGermon claimed the United States was the “No.1 development market” for the International Cricket Council.\n\n“We’re all aware of the size of market in the United States, the size of the South Asian diaspora, and the fact that the T20 World Cup will be there [during 2024 in partnership with the West Indies]. Before we know it, cricket may be in the Olympics as well.\n\n“There is a huge and growing investor base really intent on growing the game in the United States.”\n\nLoading\n\nWhile Cricket NSW will also have a high-performance partnership with the Washington DC franchise, most of the six privately owned franchises will link up with IPL clubs. Some have an increasing global reach, which includes the West Indian and now South African and UAE T20 competitions.\n\n“I think we’re moving very quickly into a world where a player will more than likely turn out for his IPL club in a number of competitions,” Germon said.\n\nWith no significant uplift in Cricket Australia’s recent television rights deal, state associations are looking for extra revenue streams to increase junior participation, with Cricket NSW seeking to double the number of five to twelve year-old’s playing the game.\n\nSports news, results and expert commentary.

San Fransico Unicorns will look to complete their squad as soon as possible so they can start their training as soon as possible.\n\nThe importance of this series is immense. It can be seen throughout the signing process as players were very happy to be signed. Liam Plunkett even gave up his English citizenship to be signed as a local player.\n\nThe league will also empower cricket in the USA, which is necessary. The USA is taking big steps to get itself noticed in the world of cricket. Their Cricket World Cup qualifiers campaign will be a statement towards that. The matches will be played in two stadiums across the USA: Grand Prairie in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina.\n\nMust Read: Jasprit Bumrah All Set To Return For Ireland T20 Series?

The 31-year-old showed in the Betway SA20 that he was ready to take on the spinners, but his reputation was certainly enhanced with a breakout season in the Indian Premier League (IPL) where he was hailed as arguably the best player of spin in the tournament.\n\nThis was supported by the fact that no IPL batter had a strike-rate of 191.3, and average of 132 against spin, that Klaasen boasted.\n\nConsidering Klaasen was a foreigner, performing on the subcontinent against the very best the spin game had to offer, was even more impressive.\n\nAnd now Klaasen has transferred that success against the slower bowlers to the inaugural Major League Cricket season where he struck 53 off just 31 balls (4x4, 3x6) to drive the Seattle Orcas to a 35-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nIt was another top-quality display against spin bowling with Klaasen creating the momentum in his innings when he came up against Pakistan wizard Shadab Khab.\n\nHaving initially been kept quiet by the Unicorns pacemen Liam Plumkett and Haris Rauf, Klaasen tore into Shadab by striking the leg-spinner for 19 runs off just eight balls, which included two sixes and a boundary.\n\n“My (plan) is to get one hit away and then get going. Try to be very aggressive against the spinners too. If the ball does not turn a lot, and it is in your half, try to hit away. Some spinners you fancy a little more, and I try to pick my spinners (to hit),” Klassen said.\n\nProteas white-ball coach Rob Walter will certainly be keeping a close eye on Klaasen and the rest of his charges currently in the United States with the incoming Australian tour on the horizon.\n\nAnd then, of course, there’s the small matter of the World Cup that is set to take place in India from October where Klaasen’s ability to score freely against spin, especially in the middle overs, will be central to the Proteas’ chances.\n\nKlaasen, therefore, is continuing to work hard on the basics in order that this red-hot streak doesn’t desert him at a critical juncture.\n\n“I have fallen into the trap of taking the game for granted,”he said. “So just waking up every day and starting on zero. Just start over again. This game humbles you very quickly and hopefully this form continues.”\n\nThe MLC opening weekend also saw fellow Proteas middle-order batter David Miller club 61 off 42 balls for the Texas Super Kings, while youngster Dewald Brevis struck a breezy 32 off 25 balls for MI New York (MINY).\n\nOn the bowling front, young tearaway Gerald Coetzee snared 2/22 for TSK and Kagiso Rabada showed a semblance of returning to form with 2/32 for MINY.\n\nAnrich Nortje and Marco Jansen also bagged 1/29 and 1/30 respectively for the Washington Freedom."

I feel like game is easy because you just got to go there and execute, right, because your muscle memory is there,” Malhodra said. “But in practice, you're trying different things, which makes it a little more harder. But that's when you prepare for a real game.”\n\nStanding by are a staff of coaches and a medical team to ensure proper hydration and recovery as North Texas sizzles under the heat dome.\n\n\"All these guys have gotten used to playing in these type of temperature and which is an advantage,\" Sagar Manoharan said.

        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) has arrived in the United States, marking the beginning of a new era for cricket enthusiasts. With influential owners from the renowned Indian Premier League (IPL) investing in franchises, the inaugural season of MLC promises to be an electrifying spectacle. This exciting development has captured the attention of fans and players worldwide, as it presents a unique opportunity to witness the fusion of international talent and American cricketing infrastructure.\n\nThe league brings together a stellar cast of players, blending established stars with emerging talents from cricketing nations. The inaugural season is poised to showcase the highest level of cricketing skill and entertainment as teams battle it out to claim the coveted MLC title. Among the myriad of talented individuals set to grace the field, there are seven players who stand out as ones to watch closely.\n\nAs fans eagerly anticipate the debut season of MLC, these players are expected to set the stage ablaze with their captivating performances, creating a lasting impression on American cricketing history. In addition to their captivating performances, these seven players are expected to leave their mark in history with their outrageous stunts, goofy antics, and epic pranks!\n\nIn this article, we highlight seven players who are set to make a significant impact in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket.\n\n1) Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings)\n\nFaf du Plessis, the former South African captain, brings immense experience and leadership to the Texas Super Kings. Known for his impeccable technique and calm demeanor, du Plessis is a reliable top-order batsman capable of anchoring the innings. His ability to construct innings and score big runs will be invaluable to his team’s success. Not to forget his recent form with the bat for the Royal Challengers finishing 2nd on the list, and an impeccable career in T20.\n\n2) Rashid Khan (MI New York)\n\nThe Afghan spin sensation Rashid Khan has consistently performed in various T20 leagues worldwide. His deceptive leg spin and remarkable control over line and length make him a lethal weapon in any bowling attack. Rashid’s ability to take wickets regularly and restrict the opposition’s scoring rate will be pivotal in MI New York’s quest for glory. Having finished 2nd on the purple cap list and continuing to maintain his mystery, Rashid would be unplayable.\n\n3) Sunil Narine (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nSunil Narine, the crafty West Indian all-rounder, is renowned for his unconventional but effective bowling style. His variations, particularly the mystery spin, have troubled many batters. Narine’s ability to stifle the flow of runs in the middle overs and contribute crucial runs with the bat makes him an integral part of the Los Angeles Knight Riders’ setup. Sunil will be rearing to undo his below-par IPL season.\n\n4) Andre Russell (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nAndre Russell, the explosive Jamaican all-rounder, is a force to be reckoned with in the T20 format. His powerful hitting and ability to clear boundaries will make him a nightmare for any bowling attack. Russell’s dynamic presence in the middle order and his knack for delivering impactful performances with both bat and ball will be vital for the Los Angeles Knight Riders. Although he is on the back of a bad year in IPL 2023, Dre Russ has had a phenomenal T20 career, and the grounds in the USA would be too small for him.\n\n5) Devon Conway (Texas Super Kings)\n\nThe talented New Zealand batsman, Devon Conway, has been making waves in international cricket with his consistent run-scoring ability. His elegant stroke play, combined with a solid technique, allows him to adapt to different situations. Conway’s ability to build innings and accelerate when needed will be crucial for the success of the Texas Super Kings. Devon was instrumental in CSK’s 5th IPL title scoring vital runs and clinching the player of the match in the finals.\n\n6) Tim David (MI New York)\n\nTim David, the Singaporean-born Australian cricketer, has impressed with his explosive batting displays in various T20 leagues. His aggressive approach, coupled with an extensive range of shots, makes him a dangerous middle-order batsman. David’s ability to provide quick runs in the death overs and his athleticism in the field will be invaluable for MI New York. His exploits in the recently concluded season of IPL 2023 will be a massive boost for the team.\n\n7) Kagiso Rabada (MI New York)\n\nKagiso Rabada, the South African pace sensation, is known for his express pace and ability to generate bounce. With his ability to swing the ball both ways and deliver lethal yorkers, Rabada is a nightmare for batters in the death overs. His wicket-taking prowess and ability to contain runs under pressure will make him a key player for MI New York.\n\nAs Major League Cricket prepares to embark on its inaugural season, the league boasts an impressive array of talent from across the globe. The presence of experienced campaigners like Faf du Plessis, Rashid Khan, Sunil Narine, and Andre Russell, along with emerging stars like Devon Conway, Tim David, and Kagiso Rabada, is set to provide thrilling cricketing action for fans. These seven players, with their unique skills and match-winning abilities, are bound to significantly impact the inaugural season of Major League Cricket. But let’s not forget. They’ll also provide us with plenty of entertainment off the field. They’ll surely bring us some hilarious pranks, wacky outfits, and maybe even a few epic dance moves!"

        "body": "Published\n\n14 July 2023\n\nCricket isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the USA. But could that be changing?\n\nA new franchise T20 tournament - Major League Cricket - began on Thursday in front of 7,000 raucous fans at a redeveloped baseball ground in Texas.\n\nIt includes six teams from major U.S. cities and involves some superstars of the sport.\n\nAnd it's got players outside the US excited, as BBC Asian Network found out.\n\nBut it makes sense to start Stateside, and with 24-year-old Pakistan all-rounder Shadab Khan.\n\nHe's played in T20 tournaments around the world, and says he's \"very excited\" to represent the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\n\"This is my first time in the USA,\" he says, adding that \"every team taking part has their big names\".\n\nThey include England's Jason Roy, who gave up his incremental England white-ball contract to play.\n\nShadab adds: \"The sports market in the US is so big.\n\n\"We want to show them it's similar to baseball and try to encourage the fans to get in the crowd. When they come they'll love it.\n\n\"When you know you're good enough, you want the opportunity to come with it.\"\n\nBut it's not just superstars taking part. There's also a pathway for young players called Minor League Cricket.\n\nAnd that's becoming more appealing to players around the world.\n\nMohammed, 25, plays for Slough Cricket Club and the South Asian Cricket Academy.\n\n\"I actually have a mate, Jai. He's left his job and everything and has gone to America now playing in the minor league,\" he tells BBC Asian Network.\n\n\"He was playing club cricket here and obviously saw opportunities out there and left quite early.\"\n\nMohammed wants to follow his mate's footsteps and explore the opportunities in the US.\n\n\"I'm looking to potentially go in the winter and spend some time there,\" he says.\n\n\"I think countries like the US are great because, I guess, if you're good enough, you kind of get into the squad straight away.\n\n\"Whereas, in other countries, it's a longer process having to prove yourself.\"\n\nWhen asked if he thinks the tournament will be a long-term success, he responds: \"I think it's going to be massive - knowing the Americans, they love to go pretty big on things. So if they invest, I'm sure it will do well.\"\n\nIt's one of only two franchises that isn't run by teams from the Indian Premier League (IPL) - the most lucrative cricket league in the world.\n\n\"You know, it may not be like the NFL or the NBA, but I think we have a place for ourselves.\n\n\"We also want to make the American side one of the premier teams who qualify for tournaments. And be a contender in the Olympics, if it happens in 2028.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

        "body": "Major League Cricket has arrived in Dallas, and it rules. The atmosphere is electric, the players are world-class, the stadium is comfortable, and the game itself—well, it’s fast-paced, and I’m starting to understand it. As a food writer, of course, I was attracted to another aspect of the experience: the concession stands, which sell South Asian food and drinks.\n\nThe playoffs are coming up this week, in four games: day and night games this Thursday, a Friday night matchup, and a Sunday night championship. Here’s what to eat and drink when you go.\n\nAll the concessions at Grand Prairie Stadium are operated by a local mini-chain called Foodistaan. Foodistaan’s first location opened in Irving in early 2022; now it’s got a second location in Southlake and plans to debut soon in Frisco and Cedar Park (outside Austin). Four restaurants and a whole darn stadium is an ambitious expansion in less than a year and a half. But, based on our stadium experience, Foodistaan is handling it pretty well.\n\nThe menu includes South Asian appetizers—samosas, chili garlic fries, and bagged snacks—along with American ballpark staples like nachos and popcorn. Chicken and veggie burgers are available (not beef), and chicken wings, too.\n\nWe thought the wings were ordinary, but the potato and pea samosas were stars. Ballpark samosas have no right to be this good: full of flavor and seasoning, with fresher pastry than some I’ve had in actual restaurants. One guy in front of us in line carried away a paper boat of six samosas.\n\nWhen we picked up our samosa order, the man at the counter pointed and told me, “The ketchup’s over there.” So I dutifully dunked a bit of samosa in ketchup. I’d never done it before, but it turns out that if you start with a spicy enough samosa, it’s not bad with ketchup. (The stadium also stocks packets of mustard, relish, mayo, and tamarind chutney.)\n\nThe big-ticket items, at $20, are takeout trays of biryani, the dish of long-grained rice, spices, and (here) your choice of veggies or boneless chicken. We passed our chicken biryani back and forth—it’s big enough for a group of four—and let the rolling heat pass over our tongues.\n\nBeers are $8—except for Arka, an Indian-style lager with rice added, which is $7. It’s light, malty, and easy to drink. There’s not a lot of information about Arka online, but based on the bottle label and some information I dug up online, it appears to be contract-brewed at the Abita Brewing Company facilities in Louisiana. It comes in glass bottles, which stadium staff pour out into red plastic cups.\n\nAt the concession stall behind our section, a lot of items were already sold out or unavailable. I was ready to take down some chili garlic fries. Maybe next time. In theory, all of Foodistaan’s stalls carry the same menu. Make no mistake: we’ll be back, and we’ll go hungry. Major League Cricket is serving up a good experience—and that includes the stadium food.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium, 1600 Lone Star Pkwy., Grand Prairie."

Fans will also be able to follow the draft live via a special show to be broadcast globally on the MLC Network YouTube channel and ESPN Cricinfo homepage. Pakistan’s A Sports TV will also carry the broadcast.\n\nThe draft selections will begin at 6:00 am IST (7:30 pm CST), following a red carpet hour with photo and interview availability with players starting at 4:45 am IST (6:15 pm CST). Photos and video from the draft will be available at this link during and after the event. Media wishing to attend the draft should email media@majorleaguecricket.com with names and media affiliation.\n\nSeveral MLC teams have unveiled their team names and logo ahead of the draft, along with high-performance partnerships with some of the world’s leading cricket entities. Select overseas star players for each time will also be announced soon.\n\nFollowing a randomized order draw held on March 13 at the Westin Oaks Houston in front of team representatives, the Seattle Orcas hold the first pick for the Domestic Player Draft. The Washington Freedom picks second followed by the New York franchise, the San Francisco Unicorns, the Los Angeles Knight Riders and the Texas MLC Team (to be named later). Teams will select nine domestic players to form the backbone of their rosters.\n\nThe draft will be conducted in a “snake order” format, meaning the team that picks last in the first round will get the first pick in the second round. The draft will last nine rounds. No trading of picks is allowed. Each team has three minutes to make their selections in rounds one to five and two minutes in rounds six to nine. The ninth round will consist of a rookie player selection (Under-23). If a U-23 player is selected by a team in rounds one to eight, that team must still select a U-23 player in the ninth round.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the first half of the Minor League Cricket (MiLC) season, a further round of the draft will take place in early July allowing teams to select one additional player based on performances throughout the MiLC season. That player will be added to the full team roster. An additional two U-23 players serving in development roles for each squad will also be selected to provide further opportunities for young players to rub shoulders with some of the world’s best T20 cricketers and coaching staff.\n\nThe league’s historic opening match will take place on July 13, 2023, at the newly-constructed Major League Cricket venue, Grand Prairie Stadium, in Grand Prairie, Texas. The 2023 season will feature 19 matches to be played over 18 days, building up to the first-ever MLC championship final to take place on July 30, 2023. More information on the MLC schedule and broadcast details will be announced later."

        "date": "Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "March 19 is set to be a landmark date for cricket in the United States as the Visitor Center of NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston will host the player draft for the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) Twenty20 tournament that is scheduled to launch in July this year.\n\nMLC will become the latest T20 league to surface across the globe, just months after South Africa and the United Arab Emirates introduced their versions to the cricketing world and almost 15 years after the Indian Premier League (IPL) changed cricket forever.\n\nAl Jazeera spoke to Justin Geale, MLC tournament director, about the aims of the league, cricket in the US and if the sport really needs another tournament.\n\nAl Jazeera: Does cricket really need one more tournament?\n\nJustin Geale: There’s too much cricket, everyone will agree to that. It’s a very full calendar. But I think we have a couple of unique things in here. One is our window and timing. We sit very nicely in July.\n\nWhat cricket needs now is new markets. If we’re going to sustain all this cricket, we need to reach new markets, new sponsors, and I think America really is the only realistic potential for it right now.\n\nIt’s such a big country and a very sophisticated sports market that is keen to take new things. In terms of growth, USA Cricket recognised this. We’re also hosting 20 matches next year as part of the jointly hosted World Cup with the West Indies. The projection for the game is strong here. If you look at LA 2028 Olympics, hopefully, we can get cricket included.\n\nThere’s also definitely a curiosity, no question about that. Which is why we aim to be here for the long term.\n\nAl Jazeera: From short stopovers to a major league, how far has cricket come along in the US?\n\nGeale: It’s been tough. The biggest challenge in this country is infrastructure, it’s finding the right spots to play the game. I come from Australia and I’ve worked in the IPL. When I got here three years ago, I was surprised at how good the domestic talent was. I was probably a bit shocked by where they were playing – lot of it was uneven outfields, football fields, synthetic surfaces, matting, etc. We needed better facilities, that’s been our biggest challenge and will continue to be.\n\nBut that’s improving and with that comes the ability to host the high-profile matches. In terms of a fanbase, there’s already an expat or first- and second-generation Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Afghans here. Throw in Australians, South Africans and the English and on the other coast the West Indies population, there’s enough knowledge and following of the game which is comforting for us.\n\nI guess the bigger hook and aim is to bring new people to the sport, to convert the Americans to cricket.\n\nAl Jazeera: Is that one of the major aims of MLC? What about revenue and the spotlight?\n\nGeale: It has to be all things, to be honest.\n\nIf it doesn’t generate revenue, it’s not going to be sustainable. The opportunity here is huge. We’re talking about the second-biggest sport in the world in the largest sporting media market in the world. If we get the product right, I’m sure the growth and revenue will come through commercial opportunities not just here in the US but also through broadcast in India where cricket revenue really is coming from.\n\nBut as a league, first we need to show we can play good cricket. If we put a good product out there – good stadiums, good players, good wickets, good umpires – it will show we’re serious about cricket and we build it out from there.\n\nWe can really get to people here who understand the game and then really try and expose it to new audiences. The American sports consumer is such a sophisticated one. It will be unrealistic to think we’re going to have full stadiums from day one and new audiences will come in because they heard about cricket. We need to tap into the existing fanbase. Also, we’ve been developing the domestic players here for three years so they are ready for this.\n\nIf we get the actual product right, the rest is going to follow pretty quick.\n\nAl Jazeera: How is the league looking financially? What are the expenses, pay scales and salary caps like?\n\nGeale: The team owners have been selected for many reasons. They have been told to buy in and that this is going to take time. They also need to commit to funding a stadium in their hometown. That’s a pretty big ask and not done in any other league. So these guys are serious about it. For salary caps, from the get-go, we’re going to be competitive with all leagues – take the IPL out though. We’ll certainly be competitive with the recent leagues like the ILT20 and SA20 and certainly have a bigger cap than something like the CPL.\n\nThe opportunity for players to come to America is an exciting one. While the money is there, it’s a pretty nice idea to come tour America, play cricket, bring your family and your golf clubs too. We haven’t really struggled at all while talking to players. Realistically, we need to manage expectations [with spending] and be sensible in terms of our projections. There’s no point going broke and not having a year two.\n\nAl Jazeera: What has the response from the sponsors been? Have you managed to break into the US market?\n\nGeale: We’ve had a really good conversation with all the usual suspects but also a few American brands. That’s a bit slow because we’re selling a dream, a vision and they are committing to something they are not familiar with. We’re in pretty advanced talks for the MLC but we’re also realistic. It’s probably going to need a bit of a punt as it is a new sport for them.\n\nAl Jazeera: So where does the MLC and cricket in the US go from here?\n\nGeale: As we get more infrastructure, the season’s length grows and we can reach out to more cities. Attracting younger and new people to the game is also something we’re aiming at. For the first time, there’s a career in cricket here. To date, if you’re good at any sport you’re going to go and play something else because there’s a pathway to scholarship and career there.\n\nMLC is an opening point to that as well. It’s in everyone’s interest to make the USA national team. All of a sudden, a lot of international teams will be keen to come on the way to the West Indies or come and do standout tours. Commercially, that opens up a lot more TV money and that money flows back into the players, the domestic structure.\n\nAl Jazeera: What challenges do you see in reaching those goals?\n\nGeale: So we’re not under any illusion to take on the MLB tomorrow. We have the existing cricket fans, they need to rally and get some critical mass. Also, distribution is important. We get some mainstream coverage and that will help with the exposure. We also need to manage expectations, like I said before. It’s tough. But our tournament window does help us, there’s a bit of downtime and hopefully we can attract new audience.\n\nIt’s going to be a hell of a ride but the key is to get year one under way, show the world we can put out a product, get decent crowds in and I think the momentum will quickly build."

        "date": "Fri Jul 21 10:49:15 2023",
        "body": "Cheers and balls smacking against cricket bats will echo out of Church Street Park until Tuesday for the first-ever Major League Cricket tournament.\n\nMorrisville, a cricket hub, was selected as one of the two towns alongside Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, to host the inaugural season’s matches.\n\nThe excitement can be felt in the home of every cricket fan in the town, especially those who made it happen.\n\nThinking about Morrisville becoming an international hub for the sport gives Jana Chellaperumal “goosebumps.”\n\n“This is a dream come true,” he said. “This is a cricket tournament on a different level that the country has never seen yet.”\n\nChellaperumal is a former president of the Triangle Cricket League, which has about 60 teams and over 3,000 players in the area. The seed to get Major League Cricket and to put Morrisville on the map for the sport was planted about 10 years ago.\n\nThe town first hosted Minor League Cricket games in 2021, giving fans a taste of what would come.\n\n“Hundreds of volunteers worked on the ground,” Chellaperumal said. “So, here we are enjoying the fruit.”\n\nThe economic impact the Major League Cricket games will have on the town is yet to be determined, said Rose Cornelius, president of the town’s Chamber of Commerce. Still, over 3,000 people from around the country are expected to be in Church Street Park, at 5800 Cricket Pitch Way, for the games between six founding national teams.\n\nAfter the games were announced in early June, tickets sold fast, with five of the seven games sold out as of Friday morning.\n\nChurch Street Park was expanded for the games, getting more cricket pitch lanes, LED-lit practice pitches and nets, athlete seating, and safety nets. Food trucks will line the park, and CBS Sports and ESPN+ will stream the games in Morrisville and Texas, broadcasting them to thousands of fans.\n\nAn investment in Morrisville\n\n“We’ve gone from being a park to now a world-class cricket facility in eight years, which is amazing,” Town Councilman Steve Rao said.\n\nUSA Cricket started eyeing Morrisville years ago to make more investments in areas with a large fan base, Rao said. Nearly half (46%) of the residents in Morrisville are of Southeast Asian descent.\n\nBecause of its large fan base, the bat-and-ball game of cricket — involving two teams, a total of 22 players, and a 22-yard field with wickets at each end — has grown in popularity over the years.\n\nSimilar to baseball, one team will bat while the other is on the field during the game. The teams switch during the long inning. The batting team will try to score the runs while the bowling team will try to stop them by fielding the ball.\n\nTeams can score up to 200 points in the match, where the game’s object is to score more runs than your opponent in a certain amount of time. To score a run, players need to hit the ball with the cricket bat.\n\nMost young cricketers have only seen their favorite players on TV or social media, but the games in Morrisville have brought the stars to the town.\n\nTop players include Afghanistan T20 captain Rashid Khan, South African internationals Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and David Miller, West Indians Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, and Dwayne Bravo, and others from England, Australia, Zimbabwe, India and New Zealand.\n\nRussell, a Jamaican cricketer for the Los Angeles Knight Riders, said in an Instagram post he didn’t know “such lovely ground was in North Carolina.”\n\nThe cricket field in Morrisville is one of three International Cricket Council-accredited fields in the country, making it eligible for the T20 Cricket World Cup, a goal for Morrisville leaders.\n\n“We’re hoping that the ICC will choose us,” Mayor TJ Cawley said. “That would have 500 million people watching. We’re hoping that this league will continue to expand and in a couple years, it would be wonderful to have one of our own Major League teams.”\n\nThe town is home to the Minor League Cricket team, the Morrisville Raptors.\n\nHow to see Major League Cricket in Morrisville\n\nTickets for the matches on Monday and Tuesday are still available starting at $12, according to the Major League Cricket website.\n\nFriday night, the Seattle Orcas face off against the Texas Super Kings at 5:30 p.m.\n\nThis story was originally published July 21, 2023, 10:49 AM."

At 115.6 kph, it had no pace for Pollard to work with, but it was too short.\n\nPollard rocked back and used brute force to dispatch it into the stands over deep mid-wicket. At 110 metres, this remains the biggest six of MLC 2023.\n\nPooran (68 in 34 balls, three fours, seven sixes) and Pollard (34 in 18, one four, three sixes) added 67 in 36 balls before falling in the space of three balls. Trent Boult (20 in six balls, one four, two sixes) then propelled New York to 194-8 as Imad Wasim finished with 2-23 and Harmeet Singh with 2-21.\n\nHowever, even that turned out to be inadequate. Nauman Anwar made 51 in 30 balls (six fours, three sixes) before Heinrich Klaasen (110 not out in 44 balls, nine fours, seven sixes) saw Seattle home with four balls to spare even as Boult returned figures of 4-31.\n\nWatch Kieron Pollard blast the 110-metre six:"

        "body": "About 7,000 people are expected to pack into a former minor league baseball ballpark near Dallas on Thursday night.\n\n​But the game they’ll see will feature hitters with fat bats swinging at bouncing balls — because the game will be cricket. It’s the first game of a new professional cricket league for the United States.\n\nThe bat-and-ball sport that’s kinda but not really like baseball is hugely popular in a lot of places that used to be part of the British empire.\n\nBut here in the U.S.? Not so much.\n\n​The leaders of the startup Major League Cricket hope to change that. They’ve invested $100 million to set up a six-team league — with rosters that include international stars — that will compete over the next two weeks.\n\nThe league is banking on interest from South Asian communities in the U.S. But the road to turning a profit could be bumpy.\n\nCricket has grown a lot in the U.S. since Ravi Etwaroo started his cricket equipment business in the Bronx, New York, in 2006.\n\n“We have local schools, high schools now taking part in cricket. We have college cricket,” Etwaroo said.\n\nMuch of that growth is an effect of South Asian immigration to the U.S. Cricket has a huge fan base in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Now, Major League Cricket hopes to take the sport pro here — and tap into those growing communities and their enthusiasm, said league spokesperson Tom Dunmore.\n\n“This probably wouldn’t have the same upside if we were doing this in the 1980s or even early ’90s,” Dunmore said.\n\nThere are now over 5 million Americans with roots in South Asia. Plus, there are expats from other cricket hotbeds — the U.K., Australia, South Africa and the Caribbean.\n\nThe next question is, “Would Americans take this on wholesale? And that’s probably going to take a lot longer,” said Stefan Szymanski, a professor of sport management at the University of Michigan.\n\nMajor League Cricket is keeping its ambitions relatively small for now, with the season just two weeks long. And even though all of its matches will be played in Texas and North Carolina this year, its teams are assigned homes — Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Washington and Texas, all locations where the league hopes to build stadiums.\n\nEven if it manages to expand, profitability could be further off, said Victor Matheson, a sports economist at the College of the Holy Cross.\n\n“This is not something you measure success in months or years. It really is something you measure in decades,” Matheson said.\n\nEven the NFL took that long to get a foothold, he said.\n\n“The folks that think, you know, ‘Oh, if we can just get through year one or two, we’re set,’ are deceiving themselves,” Matheson added.\n\nThe league said its inaugural season will be broadcast in cricketing nations around the world, and if you want to watch it here, you have to subscribe to a channel called Willow TV."

        "body": "The dying Sri Lankan cricket journalist who narrates Shehan Karunatilaka’s deranged and gorgeous novel “Chinaman” declares that, “unlike life, sport matters.” At the Grand Prairie Stadium on the outskirts of Dallas, during the first game of Major League Cricket, there were many people in the crowd who felt a similar devotion. Cricket is a sport of simple principles—whichever team scores more runs cannot lose—and seductive and near-endless subtleties. It is capable of inflicting lifelong ardor upon those exposed to a sufficiently large dose. Ravi Negi, a thirty-eight-year-old spectator at the game, was clearly one of its victims. He grew up with cricket in Hyderabad, India, which he left in 2007 when he immigrated to the U.S., and has since played in a local league on weekends. Now he watched every ball at the Grand Prairie Stadium with a nervy intensity, even though he was not particularly invested in who was going to win. A fielding mistake looked as if it caused him physical pain. Was he happy? I asked him.\n\n“Happy?” he said. “I’m very happy.”\n\nMajor League Cricket is the latest attempt to bring professional cricket to the U.S. The first game, on July 13th, was contested by the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders, two of six new franchises whose squads mix recognizable international stars of the sport with domestic players. (The other teams are the Washington Freedom, M.I. New York, the Seattle Orcas, and the San Francisco Unicorns.) The league’s opening tournament this summer is taking place over eighteen days, and nineteen matches, and is being played in two stadiums, the other one being in Morrisville, North Carolina. Another member of the crowd in Texas, Michael Klinski, had driven thirteen hours with his wife and four kids, from South Dakota. During his childhood summers, Klinski, who is forty-one, used to visit relatives in England, where he fell in love with cricket, and he still plays in a local league in Sioux Falls. “The history, the excitement, how passionate people are about it,” he said, explaining his affection for the sport. “There is more jeopardy in cricket. When you’re out, you’re out.”\n\nBeing a cricket lover in America has meant being starved of high-class domestic competition, and hunger can make you do irrational things—like driving from South Dakota to watch a game between two teams that have been conjured out of thin air and a checkbook. The organizers of Major League Cricket were counting on the devotion of American cricket’s small but fervent fan base. They needed their Negis and Klinskis to show up. Eventually, on a roasting night in a Texas heat wave, they did.\n\nIn another fine cricket novel—“Netherland,” by Joseph O’Neill—Chuck Ramkissoon, a grandiloquent Trinidadian American entrepreneur, dreams of bringing cricket to America. Chuck conjures the sport’s deep roots in the United States, as “the first modern team sport in America”—a game played by hundreds of clubs in the nineteenth century, in front of thousands of fans. (In an uncharacteristic oversight, Chuck fails to mention that Abraham Lincoln was one such fan; reportedly, the future President watched Chicago play Milwaukee in 1849.) Chuck writes to potential investors in his scheme by e-mail:\n\nIt is wrong to see cricket in America as most people see it i.e. an immigrant sport. It is a bona fide American pastime. . . . All those who have attempted to “introduce” cricket to the American public have failed to understand this. Cricket is already in the American DNA. With proper promotion, marketing, government support etc awareness of the game could easily be reawakened. American kids could once again play their country’s oldest team sport!\n\nChuck would have admired the ambition of M.L.C. The league has been driven by Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, who, twenty-one years ago, launched a cricket-streaming service called Willow TV; and M.L.C. is backed with an initial hundred and twenty million dollars in investment from tech executives such as Satya Nadella, the C.E.O. of Microsoft, and Texas businessmen including Ross Perot, Jr., the son of the former Presidential candidate. (“Don’t ask me a hard question,” Perot told me at one point in the stands. He meant a question about the laws of cricket, on which he was still a novice.) Strengthening its chances, M.L.C. has also partnered with two teams in Australia and four in the Indian Premier League—the world’s most successful and lucrative cricket competition in the sport’s biggest market—whose current valuation is reported to be more than ten billion dollars. Hence there is a team in M.L.C. called M.I. New York—which makes no sense until you realize that its Indian counterpart is the Mumbai Indians.\n\nLike the I.P.L., the American league plays T20, the most popular short form of cricket, in which each team has up to a hundred and twenty balls to score as many runs as possible, and which prioritizes aggressive batting and canny bowling. Test cricket, played between international teams wearing white uniforms over two innings and five days, is considered by many cricket lovers to be the highest form of the game—the classic movie to T20’s YouTube video—and English cricket fans are currently gripped by the test series with Australia. But, in some parts of the world, the long form of the game is ailing.\n\nM.L.C.’s money has bought talent. Jason Roy, an English batter who is signed to the L.A. Knight Riders, is reported to be receiving around four hundred thousand dollars to play in the first two seasons of the tournament. And, because he was still needed to play in the finals of the English domestic T20 season on Saturday, he was not even in Texas for L.A.’s first game. Roy’s deal is similar to those of other big stars who’ve joined M.L.C. Each franchise can have up to nineteen players in its squad; at most, nine of them can be international. (Only eleven per team can play a match.) The total budget for salaries is capped at around $1.15 million per squad. It’s not N.B.A. money, but in the world of international cricket there are few places outside India where the best players can earn as much in such a short period.\n\nPerot’s partner in a venture-capital firm that he runs, and also his co-investor in M.L.C., Anurag Jain, was confident that—particularly because of the many millions of South Asian and other immigrants from cricket-playing countries in the United States—there was enough of a market already to support the league. The organizers of M.L.C. said the U.S. is roughly the third- or fourth-largest TV market for cricket globally. (This year, Willow TV is covering most of the games, and CBS Sports Network is covering at least three; in the future, the league hopes to have a regular mainstream-TV partner.) “This season is about giving a taste to people,” he said. “Get the people here, get the right talent, get the stadium, get the fans used to all of these things. Then next season move onward. Use it as a springboard,” Jain said.\n\nThe dissonance of watching cricket in Dallas was overwhelming. The stadium itself had been converted from baseball only recently, and still contained its old scoreboard, with boxes for “inning,” “ball,” “strike,” and “out.” Around the stadium were signs warning spectators to be mindful of balls struck into the crowd—written in English and in Spanish. The police officers wore Stetsons. “The Star-Spangled Banner” was sung before play began.\n\nStill, some things about cricket are always the same. The oval field was apple-green; in a dry, hundred-and-four-degree heat, the color seemed almost obscene. In the middle was the square, the mown, straw-colored twenty-two-yard strip, or “pitch,” on which the players would bat and bowl. The surface looked good for batting. I later discovered that an Australian groundsman, David Agnew, had laid and tended the turf. Before play began, he guessed that the pitch might yield a score of around 180. The first team to bat, the Texas Super Kings, scored 181.\n\nThe match was, for the most part, entertaining. The star South African batter for Texas, Faf du Plessis, was out on his first ball—chipping an easy catch to a fielder off the bowling of the New Zealander Lockie Ferguson—but Texas rallied with explosive batting from David Miller and Devon Conway, of South Africa and New Zealand, respectively. To me, the joy was in watching Sunil Narine, the Trinidadian captain of Los Angeles, bowl. I had spoken to him the previous day, and, despite the bafflement of many Texans who had asked him what he was doing in Dallas, he was optimistic about the prospects for the league. (“Things could go big here—like, very big,” he told me.) Narine is what is known as a mystery spinner, because he can spin the ball off the pitch in a variety of ways, none predictable. Moreover, as he runs up to bowl, he hides the ball behind his back, to obscure the view of his grip from the batter—a pleasingly cartoon-villain-ish ploy. I allowed myself a brief clap of appreciation when Narine got one of the Texas batters out—what in cricket is known as “taking a wicket.”\n\nBy then, the stadium, which had been perhaps two-thirds full at the start of play, at 7:30 P.M., was almost at its capacity of seventy-two hundred. The sun had set, and, in darkness, the heat in the stadium was somewhat bearable. The crowd consisted, I guessed, of at least ninety per cent preëxisting fans of cricket, mostly of South Asian heritage. I was interested in finding new recruits to the sport, but they were thin on the ground. Christian, who had played pickup cricket with Indian-immigrant colleagues of his father’s when he was a child, had brought his girlfriend, Jamie, to watch the match. She knew nothing about cricket except for what the Internet could teach her. “I watched, like, four videos to come here, and I understood about three per cent of what’s happening,” she said. “He also acted it out for me in the living room.”\n\n“Come on,” Christian implored. “You know the ways to get wickets.”\n\nJamie smiled and shrugged. There was no help on the giant screens for anybody who had never previously watched cricket—nothing to explain the laws or the customs of the sport, which is strange to the vast majority of Americans. This seemed to me like an oversight on the part of the organizers. But they were counting on enough already devoted fans so that they wouldn’t need too many newcomers—at least at first. Perot told me during the game, “This is year one. It’s like venture capital. You want to take care of that dedicated fan base. And then you want to grow the fan base.”\n\nThe arrival of a promising professional cricket league in America marks a significant moment in a revolution in men’s cricket that began with the first season of the I.P.L, in 2008. (Women’s cricket, which is increasingly popular, is behind the men’s sport in commercial terms.) Before the Indian league transformed the finances of the sport, professionals generally played domestic cricket in their own country, often on miserly wages. The best players represented their nation, in which case they were paid more. Some pros travelled to earn money overseas, but in general the very best players were rooted in the country that they hoped to represent. The I.P.L. drafted players from all over the world, onto teams with huge budgets that often paid more for a short tournament in India than other leagues could offer for the rest of the year on traditional contracts. (In that first I.P.L. auction, in 2008, the Indian star M. S. Dhoni was bought by the Chennai Super Kings for one and a half million dollars.) Since then, other T20 leagues have emerged around the world, offering good, if not Indian-level, money. Some of the best players began to reduce their commitment to—or even forgo entirely—longer, so-called red-ball games of cricket, to play white-ball, or short-form, cricket around the world.\n\nEd Smith, who played for England, then selected its men’s national team, and was also a consultant to the head coach of an I.P.L. team, sees the birth of the Indian league and the subsequent explosion of franchise cricket as a natural development. “It’s often presented as a rupture with the way things ought to be,” he said. “But, in actual fact, the I.P.L. only righted a disequilibrium, rather than created a disequilibrium. The vast majority of cricket fans live in India. That’s where cricket’s economy is. And the market forces, you may or may not like them, but they are a fact of life like gravity. . . . It may be that the emergence of a functioning cricketing economy in America is one way in which cricket’s ecosystem becomes more balanced rather than less.”\n\nSunil Narine is an excellent example of an itinerant craftsman who has flourished in the world of franchise cricket. He last played a test match for the West Indies in 2013. Since then, between T20 internationals, his professional life has led him to the following teams: the Kolkata Knight Riders (India), the Sydney Sixers (Australia), the Guyana Amazon Warriors (the Caribbean), the Cape Cobras (South Africa), the Comilla Victorians (Bangladesh), the Montreal Tigers (Canada), the Trinbago Knight Riders (the Caribbean), the Melbourne Renegades (Australia), the Lahore Qalandars (Pakistan), the Dhaka Dynamites (Bangladesh), the Oval Invincibles (England), the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders (the United Arab Emirates), and, finally, the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nAnother Trinidadian, Kieron Pollard, captains M.I. New York. He is a big and powerful player; he doesn’t so much hit a cricket ball as seek to maim it. Nobody in the world has played more T20s than Pollard (six hundred and twenty-six games and counting). But, he told me, his decision to pursue a more commercial path and play franchise cricket was unpopular with traditionalists in the West Indies. He was, he says, branded “a mercenary” and “nonpatriotic.” Now he watched with a certain amount of satisfaction as the sport’s administrators scrambled to balance the commercial lure of franchise cricket with the traditional domestic game. “There’s still room for all forms of the game,” Pollard said. “But, a hundred per cent, there is going to be a lot of clashing going forward.”\n\nThe Texas Super Kings won the tournament’s opening game easily enough in the end. During the Texas innings, fans in the bleachers waved yellow flags when one of their men hit a good shot. But, when the Los Angeles innings began, it seemed as if a suspicious number of people were waving purple L.A. flags. If the teams in this competition engender no real loyalty yet, that is understandable. They are brand-new. Moreover, all of the matches in this year’s competition are being played in only two venues, making the connection of teams to home cities more tenuous. (Pity the diehard Seattle Orcas fan at this year’s tournament.)\n\nBefore Los Angeles succumbed, its Jamaican star, Andre Russell, scored a flurry of runs—prompting appreciative cries, even from spectators wearing yellow shirts. In the press box, above the old baseball scoreboard, a young team of digital journalists was furiously uploading new content to the league’s social-media accounts. One of the reporters, a cricket aficionado in his early twenties, took a pause as Russell hit a ball out of the stadium and into the parking lot. He turned to a colleague and said, “Bro, it’s so crazy: Andre Russell is playing in Texas.” ♦"

The team is based in Houston, Texas. It was formed in 2020 as part of 24 original teams to compete in Minor League Cricket.[1] The franchise is owned by Kuldeep Patel and Sakhi Muhammad.[2]\n\nThe team's home ground is Moosa Stadium, located in Pearland, Texas.[3] Team captain Sidhesh Pathare helms captaincy duties, while Shayan Jahangir stands by as vice-captain.[4]\n\nCaptain Nitish Kumar and American cricketer Laksh Parikh lead the bowling and batting leaderboards with 407 runs and 20 wickets respectively.[5][6]\n\nFranchise history[edit]\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nTalks of an American Twenty20 league started in November 2018 just before USA Cricket became the new governing body of cricket in the United States.[7][8] In May 2021, USA Cricket announced they had accepted a bid by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) for a US$1 billion investment covering the league and other investments benefitting the U.S. national teams.[9]\n\nIn an Annual General Meeting on February 21, 2020, it was announced that USA Cricket was planning to launch Major League Cricket in 2021 and Minor League Cricket that summer,[10] but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic[11] and due to the lack of high-quality cricket stadiums in the USA.[12] Major League Cricket was pushed to a summer-2023 launch[13] and Minor League Cricket was pushed back to July 31, 2021.[14]\n\nUSA Cricket CEO Iain Higgins also pointed out cities such as New York City, Houston and Los Angeles with a large cricket fanbase, and targeted them among others as launch cities for Minor League Cricket.[15]\n\nExhibition league[edit]\n\nIn July 2020, the player registration for the Minor League Cricket exhibition league began.[16] On August 15, 2020, USA Cricket announced the teams participating in the exhibition league matches, also listing the owners for each team.[17] The draft for the exhibition league began on August 22, 2020,[18] with the Lone Star Athletics releasing their squad on August 24.[19] Willem Ludick was later named as captain for the Lone Star Athletics for the exhibition league.[19]\n\n2021 season[edit]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the exhibition league, USA Cricket announced that they were planning to launch the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket in spring 2021.[20] Ahead of the official season, which was announced to kick off on July 31,[21] the Athletics announced Sidhesh Pathare as captain with Shayan Jahangir helming vice-captain duties.[4]\n\nThroughout the group stage, the Athletics won twice against the Catchers, the Mustangs, the Stars, and the Americans,[22] but they won once against the Master Blasters, the Lashings, the Surf Riders, and the Hurricanes.[23] However, the Athletics lost twice against the Chicago Blasters and the Hurricanes.[24] The Athletics' good performance in the group stage allowed for them to proceed to the quarter-finals.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, the Athletics were matched up with eventual title winners, Silicon Valley Strikers.[25] However, the Athletics lost to the Strikers in a best-of-three game series 2-1.[26]\n\n2022 season[edit]\n\nAhead of the 2022 season, Major League Cricket announced that it was renaming the Austin Athletics to the Lone Star Athletics.[27] MLC also announced that the draft for that season would take place on May 12.[28]\n\nCurrent squad[edit]\n\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\n\nName

        "body": "The latest T20 league to be launched, the USA-based Major League Cricket, has attracted a number of international stars but will operate without official status.\n\nWithout official T20 status, the records achieved by the players during the tournament will not be reflected in their career stats. Even if Andre Russell scores the fastest T20 hundred in the edition or Anrich Nortje registers his career-best figures, the feats will be relegated to the “miscellaneous” or the “other T20” section in the database of the statisticians.\n\nIs the MLC sanctioned by the ICC?\n\nThe Major League Cricket has been sanctioned by USA Cricket after initial disputes with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the league’s organisers. Soon after the country’s official administrative body approved the league, the International Cricket Council sanctioned the league as well. The stamp of approval by the ICC allowed the Full Members to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to their players to participate in the league.\n\nIf the league had not been sanctioned by the ICC, it would have been termed Disapproved Cricket, with Members requested not to provide NOCs to their cricketers.\n\nAny tournament that does not adhere to ICC’s guidelines is an unsanctioned league. Players who take part in such events can face consequences, varying from fines to lifetime bans. The Indian Cricket League, held between 2007 and 2009, was termed a “rebel league” with all players being banned from other events.\n\nIf the MLC is ICC-sanctioned, why doesn’t it have official status?\n\nThe ICC can approve leagues anywhere in the world if the formalities are in order as per the Regulations on Sanctioning of Cricket Events. However, a nod of approval by the ICC only means that players from across the world can take part in the tournament without the fear of being debarred.\n\nOn the other hand, a league is given official status only if it is hosted by a Full Member country. The ICC regulations state that sanctioned events hosted by non-Full Member countries cannot have stats and records attributed to them.\n\nAs the MLC is being held in the USA, an Associate country, it does not have official status. The lack of official status does not mean that the MLC is not a legitimate tournament. It simply means that the records achieved by the players during the tournament will not be counted towards their career statistics.\n\nWhich other leagues do not have official status?\n\nA number of T10 leagues in the world do not have official status, including the Abu Dhabi T10 League or the upcoming US Masters T10 League.\n\nThe Global T20 Canada, which was held in 2018 and 2019, did not have official status, and neither did this year’s ILT20, which was hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a non-Full-Member country."

        "body": "Major League Cricket got underway in Texas on Thursday, and the most serious attempt yet to establish a domestic competition in the United States provided all the ingredients of a modern Twenty20 league.\n\nFans at the purpose built cricket stadium, just a 15-minute drive from Dallas Fort Worth airport, were decked out in the yellow shirts of the victorious home side, the Texas Super Kings, and were treated to the familiar sight of big sixes and non-stop action.\n\nThe Super Kings won by 69 runs after making 181 for six and then bowling out the Los Angeles Knight Riders for 112.\n\nGet all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail. Sign up now!!!\n\nAny concerns that cricket in America might not be the real deal vanished when the action got under way and the crowd began cheering the big hitting of the home team.\n\nThe stadium previously belonged to the now defunct Texas Airhogs minor league baseball club, but since taking over the venue, MLC has spent over USD$20 million making it cricket-specific.\n\nFor viewers watching the TV broadcast, it would have been hard to tell the difference between MLC and the other T20 tournaments that have sprung up around the world.\n\nWith international players competing alongside domestic talent from the USA national team, the standard of play was clearly professional and the field and wicket looked up to scratch.\n\nThat was in marked contrast to many previous, short-lived attempts to “break the American market” with one-off events in unsuitable venues, and was also light years away from much of the domestic cricket, which for years was played on matting tracks.\n\nTexas’ South African bowler Rusty Theron was taken aback by the success of the opening game.\n\n“I am actually a little bit emotional, to be honest. This is such a grand event. There was an unbelievable atmosphere and I want to thank each and every individual who has come out here,” he said.\n\nSuper Kings batsman David Miller, who was awarded Player of the Match, for his hard-hitting 61 from 42 balls, including four sixes, was also impressed.\n\n“It’s fantastic to see such a great turn out and the facilities have been fantastic. I think there have been a few guys, kind of questioned around what it was going to be like but it shot the lights out here,” said the South African, one of a number of players with a background in the world’s top Twenty20 competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nMLC has backing from four IPL franchises including the Mumbai Indians, whose New York team began play on Friday.\n\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\n\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\n\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia’s Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India."

We run two clubs (Sydney Sixers and Sydney Thunder of the BBL), we’ve done it for 12, 13 years, we can almost come in here and hopefully give the Washington franchise a head start in terms of where it goes and where it operates,” CNSW CEO Lee Germon said during a recent Minor League Cricket Show episode.\n\nWashington, along with the five other Major League Cricket franchises, will meet for the inaugural MLC domestic draft on Sunday at the Lyndon B Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. In preparation, Washington have representatives in Houston to plan their draft strategy during the ongoing combine. Among Washington’s staff are former Australia cricketer and head of male elite cricket for CNSW, Michael Klinger, and former India phsyio, Patrick Farhat.\n\nCurrently conducting a feasibility study for would be a groundbreaking cricket and baseball facility on the George Mason University campus, Washington Freedom will likely be without a home venue until the 2025 season.\n\nMLC’s live draft show will be streamed on Sunday, March 19 on the Major League Cricket Network on YouTube."

(Photo Source: Youtube/SunrisersHyderabad)\n\nFormer South Africa pacer Dale Steyn has been appointed the bowling coach of Washington Freedom ahead of the Major League Cricket 2023.\n\nIn addition to that, Australian all-rounder Moises Henriques has been appointed captain of Washington Freedom for the inaugural edition. Henriques, aged 36, brings an extensive amount of T20 leadership skills, having won two titles with the Sydney Sixers in the last five seasons of Australia’s premier T20 competition Big Bash League (BBL).\n\nHenriques will supervise a line-up of international stars previously revealed by the franchise, which includes the likes of Anrich Nortje, Wanindu Hasaranga, Glenn Phillips, Marco Jansen, and Adam Milne.\n\nGreg Shipperd has been appointed the head coach of the side. Shipperd has been Sydney Sixers’ head coach since 2015, following a four-year stint with the Indian Premier League franchise Delhi Daredevils. Dale Steyn’s inclusion will be a massive boost for Freedom. Steyn, who ended his playing career recently, will coach Freedom after campaigns with Sunrisers Hyderabad and Sunrisers Eastern Cape.\n\nDelighted to have the legend Dale Steyn on board with us: Sanjay Govil\n\n“We are very happy with the squad we have assembled so far. Moises (Henriques) and Greg (Shipperd) have a history of winning championships together at the Sydney Sixers. It is important to build that winning culture around a young franchise right from the offset. Also delighted to have the legend Dale Steyn on board with us. The idea of having such a figure on American shores spending time with some of the youngsters on the squad is truly exciting,” said Sanjay Govil, owner of Washington Freedom as quoted by Cricbuzz.\n\nDale Steyn was part of the Sunrisers Hyderabad set-up as a player in the Indian Premier League. He went on to represent Gujarat Lions and Royal Challengers Bangalore after his stint with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. The South African pacer retired from all formats of cricket before taking up the role of bowling coach for Sunrisers Hyderabad."

        "body": "The United States will get its first taste of professional cricket on Thursday night with the launch of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC). Six teams will compete in T20, the quickest version of the game, with matches taking part across two sites with some serious star power on display for its first season.\n\nIf you’ve never watched cricket before, you’re curious about the sport, or just want to see what it’s all about then buckle in, because here’s everything you need to know in order be prepared for the first ball on Thursday night.\n\nWhat is T20 cricket?\n\nThe “20” in T20 stands for the overs each side has to score runs. An over is six balls delivered by a single bowler in succession. At that time a new bowler takes over, bowls six balls, and the process continues.\n\nTeams need to score as many runs as possible off the 180 balls as possible, and have 10 wickets (or outs) to make this happen.\n\nBecause of the need to score extremely quickly to build a big lead or chase the opponent’s total, T20 is traditionally where you see players swing for the fences and take the most risks while batting. There’s also innate strategy built into the batting order, when to use spin bowling as opposed to fast bowling, as well as balancing the risk/reward of taking shots that could rack up runs, but at the cost of giving up easy wickets.\n\nWho are the teams in Major League Cricket and where are they playing?\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nMI New York\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nThese teams will compete at two dedicated sites for the first season. A 12,000 seat cricket ground has been opened in Grand Prairie, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), with a 7,000 seat ground operating in Morrisville, North Carolina (part of the Raleigh-Durham area).\n\nWho are the players to watch?\n\nThe inaugural season boasts the best players in the United States (many of whom even the most dedicated cricket fans haven’t heard of), alongside some surprisingly big names from international cricket. Of the international players entering the league we have:\n\nRashid Khan\n\nShadab Khan\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nFaf du Plessis\n\nDavid Miller\n\nSunil Narine\n\nKieron Pollard\n\nAndre Russell\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nAaron Finch\n\nJason Roy\n\nTrent Boult\n\nAt one point all of these players were some of the best T20 players in the world and all represented their countries at an international level.\n\nHow to watch\n\nMLC has partnered with cricket streaming service WillowTV for broadcast rights in the United States. Internationally it can be watched in Australia (FOX), the Caribbean (SportsMax), New Zealand (Sky NZ), Pakistan (A Sports), South Africa (SuperSport) and the United Kingdom (BT Sport), and India (Viacom18).\n\nThe first match between the Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders will take place at 8:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, July 13."

Can't wait for the season. Come on the Freedom!\"\n\nWhen Ponting was named Washington coach in February, he had made it clear he hoped to woo top Australian names into the US adventure, noting: \"With the relationships I've had with some of these guys, hopefully those relationships and the right amount of money is enough to bring them to the Freedom.\n\n\"There's huge potential, huge growth possibilities in the US, even with the IPL ownership model the way it is at the moment, it's got potential to become huge and I want to be a part of that journey along the way.\"\n\nWashington finished third in the inaugural season of the six-team tournament last year, with the follow-up edition beginning on July 4 after the conclusion to the World Cup in the US and Caribbean.\n\nSmith has only played four T20 internationals since the start of 2023, and wasn't wanted in the Indian Premier League auction in December, so he's been short of short-format action.\n\nSmith, who owns an apartment in New York, has talked of the prospect of playing in the US as \"cool\".\n\nTalking of his prospects of making the World Cup squad, he told AAP recently: \"I think they're pretty settled up top — to be honest — with [Travis] Head, [David] Warner and [Mitchell] Marsh in the top three.\n\n\"I'm not really sure what [selectors] want to do. I'm not really too fussed either way. If I'm there, I'm there; if I'm not, I'm not.\"\n\nBut his signing caps an increasingly strong-looking Australian involvement in the tournament.\n\nAdam Zampa and Spencer Johnson will be at the Los Angeles Knight Riders, while Tim David will play for MI New York, the Mumbai Indians'-owned team, with more Australian stars still expected to be snapped up."

        "body": "oi-Sauradeep Ash\n\nMajor League Cricket, a franchise cricket tournament is set to take centre stage in the USA from next month.\n\nIn what may be a revolutionary change for cricket in the United States, the tournament is set to provide a massive platform for emerging USA players as well as their international players. There are some big names in international cricket who will represent the six teams of the MLC in the inaugural season.\n\nThere are a few Pakistani players who will take part in the MLC 2023 across the six teams. Although no current Pakistan stars could grab a deal, we will witness some former Pakistan players in the tournament.\n\nMLC 2023: Pakistan Players in Major League Cricket\n\nTake a look at all players in the MLC 2023 who have represented Pakistan at the international level-\n\nNauman Anwar (Seattle Orcas)\n\nNauman Anwar is a 27-year-old batting all-rounder who will play for Seattle Orcas in the MLC 2023. The Sialkot-born player has represented Pakistan in a solitary match, which came in a T20I against Zimbabwe back in 2015.\n\nAnwar is known for his aggressive, hard-hitting batting at the top of the order and is often compared with former Pakistan opener Imran Nazir.\n\nMukhtar Ahmed (Washington Freedom)\n\nMukhtar Ahmed is another batting all-rounder who has represented Pakistan in T20I cricket. Ahmed played 6 T20I matches and made his debut against Bangladesh back in 2015.\n\nHe has 192 T20I runs for Pakistan at a decent average of 32 and a strike rate of 143. Ahmed is known for his breathtaking batting and can also bowl a fair bit of leg-spin with it.\n\nSaad Ali (Washington Freedom)\n\nSaad Ali was a bright prospect for Pakistan cricket who came through the U-19 ranks. The batter was picked up for Test squads against England and has played for his country.\n\nHis international career spanned just 2 matches though, as his debut against Australia back in 2019 was not a rosy one. The southpaw scored 11 runs in two matches and hasn't played for his country since.\n\nThe 29-year-old has played in Pakistan Super League (PSL) for the likes of Quetta Gladiators and Lahore Qalandars.\n\nHammad Azam (MI New York)\n\nHammad Azam is part of the MI New York team which have some gigantic names in the squad. The 32-year-old made his Pakistan debut back in 2011 and last played for his country in 2013.\n\nIn the 11 ODIs that he played, Azam managed 80 runs with an average of 16. He also has 2 ODI wickets in his name. Azam also played 5 T20I matches for Pakistan.\n\nEhsan Adil (MI New York)\n\nEhsan Adil is a fast bowler who has represented Pakistan in Test cricket. The 30-year-old pacer has played 3 Tests and made his debut back in 2013 against South Africa. He has represented his country in 6 ODI matches.\n\nSaif Badar (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nSaif Badar is a Pakistani batter who has been roped in by LAKR for the MLC 2023. The 24-year-old has represented Pakistan at the under-19 level and has played in PSL for the likes of Lahore Qalandars, Multan Sultans and Islamabad United.\n\nHe is yet to make any senior international appearances for his country.\n\nSami Aslam (Texas Super Kings)\n\nSami Aslam will have a chance to represent the sister team of Chennai Super Kings, where his favourite player Suresh Raina is a legend.\n\nAslam has played 13 Tests and 4 ODIs for Pakistan spanning from 2015 to 2017. Aslam also has 7 Test fifties to his name and can be an important cog in the TSK setup at the inaugural MLC season."

        "body": "GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas — Cricket might not be a very well-known sport for many in America, but North Texas is about to be home to some of the best cricket players in the world.\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) announced Tuesday the dates for its inaugural season in the summer of 2023, which will take place in Grand Prairie.\n\nThe league’s opening match will take place on July 13, 2023, at what will be the newly-constructed Major League Cricket venue, Grand Prairie Stadium. The MLC team is converting a baseball stadium into a cricket stadium.\n\nThe season will feature 19 matches played over 18 days. The first-ever MLC championship final will take place on July 30, 2023.\n\nCorey Anderson is a former international cricket player who currently lives with his wife and family in the Dallas area. However, he grew up in New Zealand and started playing cricket as a young kid.\n\nAfter retiring from the New Zealand team in 2020, he announced in 2022 he would be playing for the USA Cricket Team and also be one of the players in the MLC season in Grand Prairie.\n\n\"It's an exciting time to be involved with cricket,\" Anderson said. \"And it's an exciting time to be in Dallas.\"\n\nSix teams from major metropolitan areas – representing Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Seattle and New York City – will each have multiple global stars on their rosters alongside the best talent based in the United States. Games will be played in the Twenty20 (T20) format.\n\n\"It's a game that's always exciting,\" Anderson said. \"There's always something happening. You're never going to get the same game twice. It's one of those sports that once you start watching it, coming to a game live is the best way to do it.\"\n\nJustin Geale is the director of cricket for MLC. He said Grand Prairie has the type of infrastructure to support the players and the teams.\n\n\"What a place to do it,\" Geale said. \"It's close to the airport. You have great hotels and infrastructure. There's also a really supportive local government. I think and I hope all my American friends love it. And I hope the general population will, too.\"\n\nThe stadium will be a 7,200-capacity venue’s playing pitch with construction set to be complete in spring 2023. Grand Prairie Stadium will be the competition’s primary venue for the 2023 season and home venue for Dallas’ MLC team. More details on the Dallas franchise – including its team name and identity – will be unveiled in early 2023.\n\n\"I think it fits with the profile of Grand Prairie,\" Geale said. \"I think it fits with the sporting community around here.\"\n\nMLC’s investor group includes Dallas-based investors Ross Perot Jr. and Anurag Jain.\n\n“Grand Prairie Stadium will be the best cricket venue in the United States upon its completion,” Grand Prairie mayor Ron Jensen said in a press release. “This venue will be a huge asset to the Grand Prairie community, bringing Major League Cricket, international cricket and potentially the 2024 ICC T20 Men’s World Cup to Grand Prairie allowing fans here to experience a world class sport in action.”\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium is the former home of the Texas AirHogs. The venue will feature 1,000 club and premium seats with the ability to expand to a capacity of over 15,000 for major events. It is expected to host matches at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024, set to be co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies.\n\n\"I think just the spectacle of being a 360 game,\" Anderson said. \"All around the ground. It's still fast-paced. Yes, it takes a few hours to still play. But it's fast-paced. There's always something happening.\""

        "date": "Tue Mar  7 20:57:48 2023",
        "body": "In a first of its kind for Victorian cricket, Cricket Victoria has finalised a strategic partnership with the San Francisco-based Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise to support the team for the inaugural edition of the groundbreaking competition that will take place later this year.\n\nThe competition will feature six teams representing major metropolitan areas in the United States, with San Francisco set to compete alongside Dallas, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Seattle and New York City. The 18-day tournament which begins on July 13, 2023, at Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, Texas, will feature some of the biggest stars in world cricket taking part alongside the United States’ best domestic talent.\n\nThe new program expands Cricket Victoria’s existing global footprint which includes an ongoing cricket development relationship with Japan Cricket, as well as having hosted and worked closely with international teams competing in World Cups and English county cricket teams at its headquarters in St Kilda over the last three years.\n\nThe initial phase of the partnership in 2023 will see Cricket Victoria and the San Francisco side focus on building their team ahead of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket, but ultimately could lead to a number of high-performance oriented initiatives that will provide opportunities for Victoria’s emerging talent as well as the chance to US-based players to learn and grow within Victorian cricket.\n\nThe professional services agreement with the San Francisco franchise, and its lead investors Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan (both Founding Partners of Rocketship VC and leading Bay Area entrepreneurs), focuses on preparing the team for on-field success during the inaugural season of MLC.\n\nCricket Victoria representatives will be in attendance at the iconic Space Center Houston, the official Visitor Center of NASA Johnson Space Center, on March 19 for the inaugural MLC Player Draft, as they assist in compiling a talented squad for the San Francisco franchise ahead of MLC’s inaugural season.\n\nCricket Victoria CEO Nick Cummins said the partnership with the Bay Area based franchise was an exciting prospect.\n\n“It’s an incredible opportunity and we’re excited to see how it unfolds over the months ahead. We’ve had very productive conversations with MLC and the lead investors of the San Francisco team over the last few months which have led us to this point,” Cummins said.\n\n“Beyond that, we have a responsibility to present new opportunities to Victorian cricket. In a rapidly evolving global cricket landscape, we believe our partnership with San Francisco and MLC gives us a chance to do just that.”\n\nLead investors of the San Francisco MLC franchise, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, said:\n\n“As MLC launches a new era for the game of cricket here in the US, this important partnership with Cricket Victoria represents a significant step for our San Francisco-based MLC franchise. In our discussions to date, we have been delighted to see Cricket Victoria demonstrate their capability and expertise to support our on-field ambitions with a best-in-class approach. We’re excited to build this partnership and accelerate our preparations ahead of Major League Cricket’s inaugural season this year.”\n\nSameer Mehta, Co-founder of Major League Cricket, said:\n\n“Following the announcement of the partnership between the Washington D.C. MLC franchise and Cricket NSW last month, we are thrilled that another globally recognized cricket organization like Cricket Victoria shares our vision to advance the sport of cricket in the United States. Cricket Victoria’s experience in growing the Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades to become two of Australia’s most recognizable sporting franchises will provide invaluable assistance to the San Francisco MLC franchise ahead of the upcoming season.”\n\nABOUT MAJOR LEAGUE CRICKET\n\nMajor League Cricket will be the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States. Exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, Major League Cricket will feature top players from around the globe while also providing an opportunity for domestic cricketers to showcase their talents to a global audience, bringing world-class T20 cricket to America for the first time."

        "date": "Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas —The promise of cricket in America could be seen and felt in the most unlikely of circumstances. Awash in Friday night lights after a scorching Texas sun, the trim green cricket oval invited fanatics and families alike to watch the Seattle Orcas chase the Washington D.C. Freedom’s 144 runs.\n\n“Deep in the Heart of Texas” played cheerfully from the loudspeakers during a brief break in the action, and local law enforcement — sporting straw cowboy hats and boots — looked on in bewilderment. Major League Cricket debuted last week, the cricketing world’s American Dream, a new field of dreams.\n\nUnlike the seesaw, to-and-fro of baseball innings, the format of cricket known as T-20 is played politely with one team batting until 20 overs (120 balls) are thrown – around the same number thrown by a baseball team in nine innings. During a cricket game’s overs, the batting squad attempts to score as many runs as possible while the bowling team, the defense, attempts to take the batting team’s wickets. Batting ends when 10 wickets are taken or 20 overs are completed, whichever comes first.\n\nIn the opening innings, DC had scored 144 runs and lost 7 wickets. Now it was up to Seattle’s assortment of Indian, Pakistani, South African, Sri Lankan, West Indies, and US players to beat that score. Seattle displayed an offense not unlike past Mariners teams – slow but steady small ball.\n\nAfter 8 overs, Seattle still needed 101 runs. With 2 overs remaining, they needed 17. Imad Wasim of Pakistan and Shimron Hetmyer from the West Indies formed a partnership that produced a pair of 6s (baseball’s equivalent of a homerun), and Shubham Ranjane came up with the winning hit for 4 (something like a ground rule double) after Hetmyer was dismissed.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas won their inaugural match Friday night with 148 runs and 5 lost wickets. They followed their thrilling victory with another win Saturday night over the San Francisco Unicorns, this time in a more decisive manner, 177 runs and 4 wickets. The Orcas took all 10 San Francisco wickets after the Unicorns put up just 142 runs. Orcas batsman Heinrich Klaasen of South Africa scored the franchise’s first “half-century,” putting up 53 runs.\n\nIn 2015, I wrote an article posing a question: Could cricket in the U.S. be a worthwhile investment? I flew to New York City to watch a tour of the world’s cricketing all-stars because, having fallen in love with the sport thanks to business travel to India and England, I was curious about its viability in America.\n\nNot long ago, the idea that Major League Soccer franchises would pop up in cities across America, each competing for international talent. Soccer was a dream to some, and a joke to others. But cricket? It’s too complicated. Don’t matches stretch on for days? It will never work. Or might the MLC and the Indian diaspora attract a legend at the end of his career, such as MLS and its “soccer is life” Latino population attracted Messi to Miami?\n\nThe night before Seattle’s match, the Texas Super Kings played the LA Knight Riders to\n\ncommence tournament play. Ross Perot Jr’s Super Kings beat the Knight Riders by a score of 181 runs and the loss of 6 wickets to 112 runs with the loss of all 10 wickets. (Thanks to an agreement with the Indian Premier League (IPL), several of the American teams share IPL mascots. Chenai and Texas are the Super Kings, Mumbai and New York are the Indians, Kolkata and Los Angeles are the Knight Riders.)\n\nAll six teams — Texas, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. — began this week’s tournament in Texas, to be continued in North Carolina, and then return to Texas for the playoffs on July 27. The scene in Grand Prairie Major League Cricket debuted to a sellout crowd of around 7,000 fans with the kind of diversity the NFL, the NBA, and MLB can only dream about. Television networks from around the world, including America’s Willow cable channel, broadcast the game live to hundreds of millions in cricket-mad places like India, Australia and New Zealand, the UK, and South Africa. International news outlets have run coverage almost hourly through the weekend.\n\nMLC took over an abandoned independent league baseball stadium (the Airhogs) in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, and invested heavily in a world class cricket oval. There, fans in Dallas Cowboys gear and Bass Pro Shop hats mixed with the national team jerseys from every cricket nation. Country and Western, Bollywood, and hip-hop blasted overhead. Fans munched on chickpeas and rice seasoned with Tex-Mex Chipotle hot sauce.\n\nThe Dallas metroplex made for a surprising backdrop. Looming over the new cricket stadium is Lone Star Park, a hulking horseracing venue. Soaring above the racetrack’s spire, commercial jets take off and land from nearby DFW Airport.\n\nInside the arena, an English gentleman from Birmingham, more recently residing in Jacksonville, stayed over in Dallas when he learned he could catch the first-ever Major League Cricket game. Tim Miller, 54, and his son Iain, 18, live locally in the Dallas metroplex and were standing near the field an hour before the action began. Iain began playing with friends, mostly Indian, in a nearby park as the pandemic began. He fell in love with the game and has now tried out for an Under-19 team. He and his father watch cricket on Willow.\n\nMark Roberts and his kids, 10 and 13, drove 12 hours from Fort Collins, Colo., to see the launch. Dad took an interest in 2018 when he stumbled across the sport on Willow. He wanted to introduce his kids to cricket because “it’s a better alternative to baseball.” Why? The action. Like a winter league baseball game in the Caribbean, fans blew whistles and anticipated, and then reacted to, every play of the game.\n\nBy all accounts, the cricket grounds and the quality of play were top-notch. Likewise, the league clearly invested in slick, professional video and merchandise. Orcas cricket is backed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Madrona Venture Group Managing Director S. Soma Somasegar; Icertis co-founder and CEO Samir Bodas; GreatPoint Ventures managing partner Ashok Krishnamurthi; and former Microsoft and Avalara executive Sanjay Parthasarathy.\n\nSoma and his family attended both Orcas games over the weekend. “We have love and passion for the sport we grew up with,” he said. “We wanted to give back to the community, to create an exciting space for kids and families. Seattle was not a day one city for the league, but we have an important base to build upon.”\n\nHe pointed out that the US and Seattle should be part of the world’s second most popular sport. “Sports bring people from different perspectives together,” he said. “ We want to unify.” Tech hubs like Seattle and Silicon Valley in California have long attracted software programmers from India. The Asian Indian population in the US has grown steadily, rising from 2 million in 2000 to more than 5 million today.\n\nIn the Seattle area, Microsoft is incorporating a recreational cricket pitch on its new campus in Redmond. King County’s Marymoor Park, where Seattle’s amateur league has played for decades, envisions its own professionally-run stadium.\n\nWhat’s next for MLC? Seattle will play three more matches in Morristown, N.C., over the weekend. The teams return to Texas for the championship round. Beyond that, it’s a little uncertain. MLC franchises expect to have their grounds in order by the 2025 season. Tom Dunmore, who heads MLC marketing, said the hope is that 2025 will be the first regular season.\n\nNext year, the United States and the West Indies (Jamaica, Bahamas, Antigua) will co-host cricket’s World Cup. The International Cricket Committee (ICC), the equivalent of soccer’s FIFA, is currently working to identify host cities. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland are possibilities. With the Oakland Athletics heading to Las Vegas, that could open up a suitable stadium. The Oakland Coliseum is known for its generous foul territory, which would enable a proper cricket oval.\n\nDunmore says MLC will wait to see what the ICC comes up with, and perhaps next year’s MLC tournament could be played on a World Cup pitch. “Not to be cliché, but if you build it people will come,” Dunmore said.\n\nA little more Cricket 101 on how the game is played More than 10 years ago on a trip to New Delhi, I downloaded Cricket for Dummies in order to be conversant on the subject since the Australian national team was touring India. The test match, this one played over weeks, was all anyone wanted to talk about.\n\nStill puzzled? Here’s a short lesson that might be helpful. As in baseball, a batsman (batter) stands before a bowler (pitcher) and swings at pace balls (fastballs) and spin or swing balls (curves and sliders) attempting score runs. The batsman can score 1-3 runs with hits inside the boundary (fence) or 4 runs at once if a fielder fails to stop the ball from exiting the boundary. If the batsman clears the boundary in the air, it’s 6 runs.\n\nAnd what are wickets? Wickets are taken by the defense. The defense can take a wicket by catching the ball in the air, smacking the stumps behind the batsman or hitting the batsman’s leg pads without contact with the bat. A batsman can stand at the crease (like baseball’s plate) all day if the defense cannot take the wicket."

Aimed primarily at the 5 million South Asian expats in the U.S., the six participating cricket teams feature a mix of worldwide cricket stars and domestic talent.\n\nCricket attracts more than 2.5 billion fans globally, only trailing soccer, according to Front Office Sports.\n\nWhile cricket hasn't permeated U.S. sports culture quite yet, the league has managed to draw attention from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and New York Magazine, among other outlets. And in terms of the game's fans, Major League Cricket was a smashing success, said Tom Dunmore, VP of marketing for the league.\n\n“The amount of energy and attention locally, nationally and globally has been completely mind-blowing,” Dunmore said. “We’ve sold out more than two-thirds of our matches and we could have sold more tickets to many of our matches. The atmosphere has been incredible, and the fans have been so passionate. There are hundreds of fans waiting to get autographs, desperate to meet their heroes. It’s hard to convey to American mainstream sports followers and media just how big superstars these players are.”\n\nRashid Khan, a bowler for MLC’s MI New York squad with 7 million Instagram followers and a Monster Energy endorsement deal, is one of them.\n\nThe league was able to secure top stars due to its short season—just 18 days long beginning earlier this month—that doesn’t interfere with other pro leagues in places such as India, England and Australia. And unlike most U.S. team sport athletes, cricket pros aren’t bound to a single team or league.\n\n“To get [Lionel] Messi, [Inter Miami] had to pay a lot of money and it’s still hard [for Major League Soccer] to get top stars in their prime,” Dunmore said. “We can bring over the top stars in their prime for these short tournaments and they compete at the same level as they would in the top cricket countries. We’re immediately able to be at the top level of the sport, and the fans recognize that.”\n\nAlso read: See Lay's US welcome message to Messi made of goats\n\n$1 billion investment\n\nThe league is backed by a $1 billion investment from American Cricket Enterprises, a group funded by Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, the founders of Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America; and Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain, the principals of The Times of India Group, India’s largest media conglomerate. Other investors include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nLeague corporate partners include Royal, the U.S.-based Indian foods brand; Abound by the Times of India, a financial app aimed at Indian expats; Cloudchef, an AI recipe and food delivery app; Sling; Betbricks7, a casino games app; and Betway, the online betting and gaming brand.\n\nRoyal this month debuted its first U.S. ad to promote awareness of the sport’s inaugural season. “The Many Flavors of Cricket,” from the agency McCann, displays the blending of culture, cuisine and cricket.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of South Asians in the United States have arrived in the U.S. in the last 15 years, so they are living a somewhat plural existence. Connection to culture, language, and traditions become even more important when you are living abroad,” Andrew Cops, senior VP of sales, marketing and product development for LT Foods, Royal’s parent, said in emailed remarks. “Major League Cricket’s inaugural season was the perfect opportunity to bring our cultural goals to life through the fusion of the exhilarating sport and delicacies synonymous with the experience.”\n\nMLC games are broadcast by Willow and streamed by Sling, with some games airing on Paramount’s CBS Sports Network. The league consists of six teams representing Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Washington, D.C., and New York City. This season, most games were played at a converted minor league baseball stadium near Dallas, with others at a cricket facility known as Church Street Park near Raleigh, North Carolina. Plans call for teams to eventually establish their own home parks.\n\nMLC plays a version of cricket known as Twenty20, or T20, which refers to the 20 “overs,” or set of six pitches, each team is limited to. The result, said Dunmore, is a faster-moving game with more action. T20 games typically take less than three hours to complete; traditional “test” cricket has matches that can last for five days.\n\nDunmore said the league would look to widen its fanbase in coming years. “Our goal this year was to build on this established platform of cricket lovers. That’s the base we can build off. From that, we can reach out to different types of fans and grow the sport more broadly, and there’s a lot of ways we can do that: education, outreach, influencers, and partnerships with other sports teams,” he said. “We did just a little bit of that this year, but that’s a year two, three, four activation for us.”"

With the T20 World Cup taking place on US soil later in the year, we see this as a breakout year for cricket in the US and can’t wait to be a part of it.”\n\nVijay Srinivasan, Co-Founder, Major League Cricket, said, “MLC is thrilled to welcome Stake as an official partner to help support the growth of the league and the game of cricket in America. We’re excited to be partnering with a renowned company that supports many global sports properties.”\n\nStake boasts the highest transaction volume in the online casino world. The company has established a strong presence in the sports sponsorship landscape via partnerships with UFC, Everton FC (Premier League), and the Stake F1 Team. The entity’s business model focuses on offering the highest return to player (RTP) rates, attracting a massive user base.\n\nThe 2023 MLC season marked a watershed moment for American cricket. It introduced high-calibre domestic T20 action to the US, with matches in Texas and North Carolina experiencing sell-out crowds. Further solidifying its position, MLC recently announced Cognizant, a major American IT services company, as its title sponsor, with Royal joining as a signature partner.\n\nThe highly anticipated T20 tournament kicks off on July 4, featuring some of the world’s best cricket players. The Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Texas has been confirmed as a venue, with additional locations to be announced soon."

        "date": "Fri Mar 24 04:45:00 2023",
        "body": "Tech wizards who made their mark as early investors in Facebook and selling startups to Amazon and Walmart are the men behind the San Franciso team propelling Aaron Finch and Marcus Stoinis into the new world of elite cricket in the United States.\n\nFinch will captain the San Francisco Unicorns and Stoinis will be one of his major weapons as part of the six-team Major League Cricket Twenty20 competition which kicks off in July as the most ambitious attempt yet to take the sport beyond club level in the US.\n\n“Any time a new competition starts - especially somewhere like the US, where they haven’t had a huge amount of cricket before - it’s exciting,” Finch told the Herald and The Age. “The opportunity to get into the league at the start was really attractive.”\n\nLead investors in the San Francisco team, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, are mates from Chennai who did PhDs in computer science at Stanford University and have become successful entrepreneurs.\n\nUnited by their love of cricket, they once set up a satellite dish on a hall at Stanford so the many cricket fans on campus from South Asia and beyond could watch the 1996 World Cup in India.\n\nRemarkably, North America, combining the US and Canada through Willow TV, is now the third-largest market for Cricket Australia’s television rights behind India and England and has been for some time, highlighting the potential size of a market crying out for organisation and investment.\n\nWillow TV founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, who sold it to the Times of India in 2016 for $150 million, are behind Major League Cricket.\n\nSpeaking from San Francisco this week, Rajaraman sounded even more enthusiastic than Finch about the impending launch of MLC.\n\n“I’m super excited,” Rajaraman told the Herald and The Age. “It’s all going to come down to the quality of the cricket that gets played and I think it will be super high-quality cricket.\n\n“We really have a shot of becoming, in the long run, one of the top three T20 tournaments in the world. That’s where we’ve set our sights and we think it’s possible.”\n\nLeading overseas players in the MLC can earn $260,000 for five matches and a potential final compared to top Big Bash players without marketing deals, who max out at about $220,000 for 14 games plus finals.\n\nSan Francisco has a partnership with Cricket Victoria, which will provide staff and expertise for the tournament along with players, hence the signing of Finch from the Renegades and Stoinis from the Stars, with the likelihood of more to come.\n\nThey will be joined by former World Cup-winning England fast bowler Liam Plunkett and former New Zealand allrounder Corey Anderson, who are among 46 former first-class cricketers now living and playing in the US’s Minor League.\n\nLoading\n\nVictoria followed a model first set up by Cricket NSW in a partnership with Washington Freedom, which is likely to see NSW players join that franchise. Washington Freedom have combined with George Mason University to study the feasibility of a new multi-purpose cricket and baseball facility.\n\nThe Freedom have signed the world’s fastest bowler, South African Anrich Nortje, and Sri Lankan leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga.\n\nThe remaining four teams are essentially owned or run by IPL teams, which has already had a direct impact with the signing of Mitch Marsh by the Seattle Orcas, who are co-owned by the Delhi Capitals, Marsh’s IPL club. He will be joined at the Orcas by former South African captain Quinton de Kock.\n\nOther MLC franchises with IPL connections are the Texas Super Kings, MI (Mumbai Indians) New York and Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nThe biggest hurdle to the event are the petty administrative squabbles which have held cricket in the US back for decades.\n\nThe International Cricket Council has sent letters to major cricketing countries saying that USA Cricket, which has a long-term agreement with MLC, have not sanctioned the event. However, an MLC spokesman said the necessary sanction was expected in the coming days.\n\nCricinfo reported that the hold-up may be a ploy by USA Cricket to try and extract more revenue from MLC investors.\n\nThere has been a concerted effort in recent years to raise the standard of cricket in the US through the Minor League, with a two-week trial of the best players before an inaugural Major League draft for local players held early this week.\n\nLoading\n\nVictoria and NSW, who are compiling team lists and overseeing high performance for their franchise partners, sent representatives to the trials and the draft.\n\nCricket Victoria’s CEO Nick Cummins and Cricket NSW head of elite male cricket, Michael Klinger, were impressed with the quality of local players, describing them as ranging from BBL to Premier Club (Grade Cricket) standard.\n\nThe combined start-up costs for the MLC and the six clubs, which are all privately owned, is estimated at $180 million. And up to that much again will be invested in the coming years building elite venues for each team in a country where baseball diamonds and rectangular football fields dominate the landscape."

Seattle just got another pro sports team — a Major League Cricket squad named after the killer whales that frequent our shores.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas will have their debut season this summer as one of six US pro cricket teams. It’s got a logo and started filling out its roster through a domestic draft on Sunday, March 19. The squad plans to eventually play in Redmond at a new field yet to be built.\n\nPut on those fancy cable-knit sweaters as we dive into Orcas mania.\n\nHold up, what’s cricket again?\n\nWhy, it’s the second-most watched sport in the entire world (after soccer). Cricket is also an ancestor to baseball where athletes attempt to hit thrown leather balls with large, wooden bats. Instead of bases, there are wickets on the field where the batsman runs to and from in order to score — it’s a real hoot.\n\nThere are forms of cricket in which a single match can last several days. But the Orcas will play in what’s called Twenty20 cricket — an abbreviated version with more manageable, two-and-a-half-hour matches.\n\nWhere can I watch our team?\n\nLast spring, plans began for a 20-acre Redmond site at Marymoor Park that aims to seat 6,000 fans. Local officials have given the green light for the facility, but Major League Cricket said that it may not host the Orcas until 2025 because of the time it will take to design and construct."

        "date": "Wed Jul 12 10:00:00 2023",
        "body": "It's time to shift our gaze to the five bowlers to look out for in the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket. The list includes the raw pace of Anrich Nortje and the mystery spin of Sunil Narine.\n\nAnrich Nortje\n\nFor all the cutters and slower bumpers having been introduced in the game over the last decade, there is still no substitute for pace. Because, when the speedometer reads 90 mph or more, there's a chance that the lesser mortals go in survival mode and focus on self-preservation rather than going on an all-out offence which is the name of the game in T20 cricket.\n\nSouth African speedster and now Washington Freedom import Anrich Nortje is easily the fastest bowler in world cricket at the moment alongside England's Mark Wood and is sure to rattle a few batters in the inaugural Major League Cricket tournament. One can only imagine that when even the best batters in the business fail to tackle Nortje's searing pace at times, how would the local players fare against the Protea tearaway.\n\nAnrich Nortje would be one of the favourites to top the leading wicket takers in the tournament over at betway satta and is 2-1 to be top wicket taker in their opening match against Seattle Orcas\n\nRashid Khan\n\nIf a tearaway wasn't enough, the MLC batters will have to deal with the mystery spin of Rashid Khan as well who is arguably the best T20 bowler in the world at the moment. Rashid not only captains his national side Afghanistan but has set the global T20 circuit on fire with match-winning performances across the board.\n\nThe spin maestro was recently part of defending IPL champions Gujarat Titans who ended up as runners-up in the 2023 edition. Along with compatriot Noor Ahmad, Rashid made life hell for the batters and the fate of a lot of teams in MLC will depend on how they tackle the leg spin, the googly, the top spin and a host of other variations from Khan.\n\nTrent Boult\n\nDepending on the ball used and the atmospheric conditions, Trent Boult will extract massive or little swing in Major League Cricket 2023. Be that as it may, the Kiwi would be a handful to handle for all openers inside the powerplay.\n\nBoult, who is not part of a traditional central contract with NZC at the moment, has already decided to turn a freelance T20 globetrotter for the remaining years of his career, and will have another opportunity to display his chops in the upcoming competition.\n\nThe left-armer has the rare ability to bring the ball back into the right-handers from over the wicket and swing the new nut quite late which always poses tough questions for the openers.\n\nSunil Narine\n\nLike compatriot Andre Russell, Sunil Narine hasn't been at his absolute best over the last couple of years, but the mystery spinner still remains among the best in the world.\n\nCarrying forward his long-standing association with the Kolkata Knight Riders, Narine will ply his trade for Los Angeles Knight Riders in MLC 2023 alongside Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Lockie Ferguson, Martin Guptill, Adam Zampa, Rilee Rossouw, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan and Unmukt Chand.\n\nNarine provides great value due to his ability to bowl in any phase of the game - be it the powerplay, the middle overs, or the death. At his prime, Narine not only kept the runs dry but also picked truckloads of wickets. At the fag end of his career, even if he can do one of the two tasks, Los Angeles Knight Riders will have their money's worth. And don't forget his ability with the bat at the top of the order.\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nMuch like Anrich Nortje, New Zealand's Lockie Ferguson has the ability to hit 95 mph and is capable of instilling fear in the opposition players - particularly the local batters.\n\nLockie Ferguson did not have a great IPL 2023, but he is a tried and tested player who hasn't compromised on his pace over the years. Used by New Zealand as a middle overs enforcer in the 2019 ODI World Cup, Ferguson can play the same role for Los Angeles Knight Riders, and with some distinction.\n\n© Cricket World 2023"

        "body": "New Delhi: Just days after a historic Major League Cricket (MLC) draft in Houston, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has shot an email to its members and urged them to not issue NOCs (No Objection Certificate) to its players for MLC and MiLC (Minor League Cricket).\n\nDuring the 19 March draft, plenty of current and former international stars such as Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Quinton De Kock, Mitchell Marsh, Wanindu Hasranga, Anrich Nortje were picked by the teams for the tournament scheduled for 13-30 July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nICC has “disapproved” the MLC and MiLC competitions, which were being looked as revolutionary for cricket in the region. Additionally, USA Cricket has not sanctioned the league either.\n\nMLC and MiLC are administered by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), which signed a 50-year commercial rights agreement with USA Cricket in 2019.\n\nICC expects US Cricket to resolve internal mess; may allot India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup game\n\nIt does, however, nudge the cricket body in USA to set their house in order before similar treatment is meted out to their 2024 T20 World Cup 2024 co-hosting plans.\n\nAt the ICC quarterly meeting earlier this month, USA Cricket bought time to resolve their internal mess by appointing an interim elected body to host matches for the marquee event next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“To think that a World Cup had been allotted here (ICC insists USA are ‘co-hosts’) is even more terrible to hear. Where’s the local cricket board? Where’s the infrastructure? Who are the people responsible for running the affairs here?,” said those in the knowing.\n\nUSA Cricket Interim CEO resigns\n\nEarlier this week, USAC Interim CEO Vinay Bhimjiani, who replaced Iain Higgins, resigned after just five months in the role. Search for Bhimjiani’s replacement is already underway with the chair sitting vacant for now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead | Start of T20 league in US with IPL investment likely to change cricketing ecosystem\n\n“The USA Cricket Board has confirmed that the USAC Interim CEO, Mr. Vinay Bhimjiani, has resigned effective immediately to pursue other personal opportunities. Mr. Bhimjiani served as Interim CEO for approximately 5 months,” USAC said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeed for structure\n\nEarly lessons after the MLC draft point towards a desperate need of order in USA Cricket. If the association wants to pull off something as big as the T20 World Cup and a possible India-Pakistan fixture, things need to head in the right direction and all stakeholders must align.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are continuous questions being raised on 2024 T20 World Cup fixtures being allotted to the USA – a region clearly underprepared - and the roadblocks which MLC is hitting right after the draft are not encouraging.\n\nAfter a Chief Executives Committee (CEC) meeting of the ICC on Saturday, it was decided that the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) will continue to remain primary hosts of the tournament and matches will be allotted to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement"

With over 2.5 billion fans worldwide, it’s the second most popular sport, falling closely behind soccer.\n\nThe sport has a long and complex history in the United States.\n\nCricket originated in the early 17th century in southeast England. It was played in 1833 at Haverford College, University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, and Columbia.\n\nWhile the sport didn’t take off well in the U.S., it was quickly adopted in countries like India, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.\n\nNow, some of the biggest investors in the U.S. are looking to bring professional cricket to the U.S., where there is an estimated 63 million fans.\n\nAfter a slow start due to COVID-19, Major League Cricket launched and is currently playing its inaugural season in July 2023.\n\nCricket is the Second Most Popular Sport in the World\n\nIn America, the NFL reigns supreme, and baseball is known as “America’s National Pastime”.\n\nHowever, globally, Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world, reaching 2.5 billion fans across 180 nations.\n\nIn India alone, there are about 1 billion fans and Cricket’s biggest stars have a huge reach on social media.\n\nFor reference, cricket star Virat Kohli has 256 million Instagram followers, which is more followers than some of America’s biggest athletes, including LeBron James, Tiger Woods, Patrick Mahomes, and more.\n\nAnd with many fans from other countries now residing in the States, the U.S. suddenly has a huge cricket market. There are about 63 million fans engaging in the sport annually from the United States.\n\nCheck out the list below for Cricket’s biggest markets in the world.\n\nIndia — 535 Million\n\nChina — 408 Million\n\nUnited States — 63 Million\n\nIndonesia — 55 Million\n\nBrazil — 25 Million\n\nMajor League Cricket Plans For The U.S.\n\nEarlier this summer, thousands of fans traveled to a sold-out stadium in North Texas to watch the first-ever Major League Cricket event in the United States. Fans traveled from all over the country like California, Florida, and New York to pack into a venue of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit to watch the match.\n\nThe atmosphere was said to be “electric”, as fans witness the beginning of Major League Cricket in the U.S.\n\nWith billions of fans around the world, the U.S.-based Cricket League has raised over $120 million in funding from some of the biggest executive techs, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen.\n\nBig things are happening for the league in the near future too.\n\nThe MLC is expected to play a shorter version of cricket called T20, which is supposed to produce more hits and scoring in just three hours.\n\nThere are also major stadium renovations happening in Texas and North Carolina. Meanwhile, Shah Rukh Khan, an MLC investor committed funds to build a 10,000-seat cricket stadium in Los Angeles.\n\nRecently, USA Cricket granted Major League Cricket the exclusive license to run a professional T20 league in the U.S.\n\nCricket Betting Guides 2024"

Pooran arrived at No.3 and set the stage on fire immediately.\n\nHe hit his second and third balls – the last two of the first over of the innings – for sixes. The third over, bowled by Dwaine Pretorius, went for 28 runs, including three sixes and two fours, while the last over of the powerplay bowled by Andrew Tye went for 18, including three more sixes.\n\nBy the end of six overs, New York had raced to 80-2, with Pooran scoring 69 of those. And he did not relent after that either. He hit four more boundaries in the next two overs and reached his hundred in the 12th off just 40 balls.\n\nA chase that had looked difficult on paper when at the beginning was turned into a cakewalk. By the end of the 12th over, New York needed only 49 in 48 balls.\n\nPooran scored 37 off the last 17 balls he faced after his hundred, and New York completed the chase on the last ball of the 16th over when he squeezed out a Cameron Gannon yorker to the fine leg fence to collapse on the pitch and let out a roar.\n\nWith this victory, the Mumbai Indians brand have now won the inaugural editions of the Women’s Premier League and Major League Cricket this year, to go along with their five IPL and two Champions League trophies.\n\nWatch all of Nicholas Pooran’s sixes from his outrageous century in the MLC 2023 Final:"

Four of the six teams are either owned or part-owned by IPL franchises. It follows IPL investment in the Caribbean Premier League, the South African T20 and International League T20 in the UAE.\n\nThe other two franchises have strategic partnerships with New South Wales Cricket and Cricket Victoria in Australia.\n\nThere are also powerful backers from the American business community, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Ross Perot Junior, son of the former US presidential candidate.\n\nWhy take cricket to America?\n\nWith an estimated 30 million cricket fans in the US, largely from expatriate communities, and the largest sports media market in the world, the attempt to crack America makes sense.\n\nMLC tournament director Justin Geale said earlier this year: “The opportunity here is huge. If we get the product right, I’m sure the growth and revenue will come through commercial opportunities, not just here in the US but also through broadcast in India where cricket revenue really is coming from.”\n\nHowever, MLC is unlikely to make much of a dent in the American market any time soon, particularly as it takes place at the height of the Major League Baseball season.\n\nIndeed, even those behind MLC have admitted they are unlikely to attract attention from uninitiated American fans for at least 10 to 15 years.\n\nIn the short term, it is the impact the league might have on other countries, particularly England, that will be telling.\n\nAlthough it doesn’t clash with either the T20 Blast regular season or the Hundred this year, that is unlikely to remain the case, particularly as the US is co-hosting next year’s Men’s T20 World Cup, meaning MLC is likely to be pushed later into the summer.\n\nHow much will players get paid?\n\nThe money is also attractive – Roy and other star overseas names will be paid £150,000-£200,000 for two weeks’ work, as opposed to the top-tier salary of £125,000 in the Hundred. Other England stars may well follow Roy in the coming years, which would damage the English domestic game.\n\nYet there are logistical issues, namely a lack of venues. The inaugural tournament will have most of its games played at one ground – the 7,500-capacity Grand Prairie stadium on the outskirts of Dallas. Church Street Park, a 3,500-\n\ncapacity venue in Morrisville, North Carolina, is also expected to host games. It’s hardly Madison Square Garden or Fenway Park.\n\nThis is the big leap MLC has to take, with team owners committing to build stadiums in their own cities from as early as 2025. “That’s a pretty big ask so these guys are serious,” says Geale.\n\nWhether or not cricket can realise its American dream is doubtful, but for now the hopes are high among those who have backed that dream with millions of dollars. Time will tell if it’s a reckless gamble or inspired investment.\n\nTeam-by-team guide\n\nMajor League Cricket will take place between 13-30 July, with 19 matches played\n\nMI New York\n\nBacked by: Mumbai Indians IPL franchise\n\nStar players: TBC (no overseas signings as yet).\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nBacked by: Kolkata Knight Riders IPL franchise\n\nStar players: Jason Roy, Nitish Kumar.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nBacked by: Delhi Capitals IPL franchise\n\nStar players: Quinton De Kock, Dasun Shanaka.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nBacked by: Chennai IPL franchise\n\nStar players: TBC.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nBacked by: New South Wales Cricket\n\nStar players: Anrich Nortje, Wanindu Hasaranga\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns"

        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) is set to hold its first season between July 13 and 30 with six teams taking part.\n\nAn initial pot of $120 million (£97 million/€111 million) is funding the league and owners of mega-rich Indian Premier League (IPL) clubs have a stake in four of the American franchises.\n\nThis includes the LA Knight Riders in the 2028 Olympic host city, who are owned by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and his KKR Group.\n\nKhan, one of the richest actors in the world, also owns IPL side Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nCricket in Los Angeles is also set to benefit from plans to develop a venue for the team in Great Park in Irvine.\n\nA 5,000 to 7,000 seat stadium is being planned with hopes to have it operational before the 2026 season.\n\nThis means the Knight Riders may have played in it for two seasons before the 2028 Olympics, and that cricket could be held there during the Games.\n\nThe International Cricket Council has already spoken to the KKR Group to hear more about the plans.\n\nIt is hoped that all of the MLC teams will have their own ground by 2026, and other venues for the sport are also springing up in a country which has little cricket heritage.\n\nBroward County Cricket Stadium in Fort Lauderdale in Florida boasts 20,000 seats and will likely be used at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup in 2024 which the US is due to co-host with the West Indies.\n\nCricket West Indies already stages matches there, while the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas has been transformed from a baseball venue to a cricket facility.\n\nThis will be used for the Texas Super Kings MLC side, which has connections to the IPL's Chennai Super Kings.\n\nVenues will also be built for the remaining MLC teams - San Francisco Unicorns, Washington Freedom, Seattle Orcas and Mumbai Indians New York.\n\nIn Los Angeles, other options could include a greenfield site to the south of the Rose Bowl, where the ICC could curate a pitch and outfield within 12 to 18 months.\n\nElsewhere in California, the Oakland Coliseum baseball stadium could accommodate cricket as current tenants Oakland Athletics are relocating to Las Vegas.\n\nCricket is one of nine sports on the shortlist to be added to the Los Angeles 2028 programme, along with baseball/softball, breaking, flag football, karate, kickboxing, lacrosse, motorsport and squash.\n\nA decision is expected at the International Olympic Committee Session in Mumbai, which is scheduled from October 15 to 17.\n\nEngland cricketer Jason Roy yesterday ended his national contract in order to play in the MLC."

And the ECB made no attempt to stop Roy playing in the Pakistan Super League last month.\n\nThe first American competition does not clash with this year’s Hundred, which for probably only one more summer has an international-free window in August, but any involvement from Roy might mean him missing part of Surrey’s Twenty20 Blast campaign.\n\nEngland, as the Mail on Sunday revealed this week, are planning to fight off the threat of the franchises to the primacy of international cricket by vastly increasing match-fees for non-centrally contracted players.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether, long-term, that is enough to keep the ever-increasing number of leagues backed by big IPL cash at bay."

        "body": "The inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC) is making waves as American interest in cricket surges. With the US set to co-host the T20 World Cup next summer, the nation anticipates a cricket boom. MLC’s stars, including Quinton De Kock and David Miller, showcased their skills at the recent ICC Cricket World Cup. The upcoming World Cup promises economic dividends and increased tourism for American venues. As cricket gains traction, the 2028 Olympic Games will feature the sport, fuelling optimism for the rising profile of American cricket.\n\nSign up for your early morning brew of the BizNews Insider to keep you up to speed with the content that matters.

Register here.\n\nAmerican Cricket’s (World) Cup Runneth Over: Bobby Ghosh\n\nBy Bobby Ghosh\n\nOne of the planet’s biggest sporting events came to a climactic conclusion last Sunday, with Australia upsetting the odds to beat hosts India in the final of the ICC Cricket World Cup. The US was not among the 10 teams that qualified for the tournament, but there was, for the first time ever, an American interest in the sport’s international competition.\n\n___STEADY_PAYWALL___\n\nThat’s thanks to this summer’s inaugural season of Major League Cricket. Fourteen of the 51 overseas players who were spread across the MLC’s six teams featured at the World Cup, with the South African pair of Quinton De Kock (Seattle Orcas) and David Miller (Texas Super Kings) catching the eye with big performances.\n\nBut, to gratuitously mix sporting metaphors, the US will have much more skin in the game next summer, when it co-hosts the next World Cup, along with seven Caribbean islands. Around a third of the 55 games will be played in three American venues — one each in New York’s Nassau County, Florida’s Broward County and Dallas, Texas — and the US national team will get automatic qualification.\n\nThere will be an economic dividend, too. Cricket is the world’s second-most popular sport after soccer, which makes it highly attractive for international brands. Advertising around World Cups is an especially effective way for companies to connect with the vast Indian market: The nation of 1.4 billion people is famously cricket-mad. Each of the three American venues can also expect a boost in tourism, as fans follow their teams.\n\nIn case you’re wondering how there can be World Cups, which tend to be quadrennial, in consecutive years, this is as good a place as any to pause for an explanation. The sport is played in three formats, all of them governed by the International Cricket Council: “Test” cricket games are played over five days; “one-day international” contests, or ODIs, usually run to seven or eight hours each; and “T20” matches, the format chosen for the MLC, last roughly the duration of a baseball game. The recently concluded World Cup was for ODIs, the one coming up next June will be for the T20 version.\n\nBack to the point I was making: The T20 World Cup will again serve as a showcase for the MLC’s stars. More than that, it will also be a show window for international talent hoping to be snapped up by teams for the second season, which will be played shortly thereafter. “There’s already some buzz about the MLC among top players,” Tom Dunmore, the league’s head of marketing, tells me. “When they get a chance to experience cricket in America, more of them will want to join us.”\n\nMore stars will allow the MLC to expand its audience, at home and abroad, after a good first season: Dunmore says 92% of ticket capacity was sold out and games were broadcast in 87 countries.\n\nNext year’s World Cup will benefit American cricket more generally. In addition to giving homegrown cricketers exposure to top-level competition, it may also convert more Americans to the sport — doing for cricket what the 1994 FIFA World Cup did for soccer. “When you have the best in the world playing in your backyard and an international audience of hundreds of millions following closely, some of that excitement is bound to rub off,” Dunmore says.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure will help, too: A new cricket stadium will be built in Nassau County and the one in South Florida will be expanded. Oswego, Illinois, is reported to be planning a cricket stadium, too, even though it is not expected to be used for the World Cup.\n\nAnd as if to keep the momentum going, cricket will also feature in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. By then, the LA Knight Riders, co-owned by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, should have a purpose-built cricket stadium up and running.\n\nThis is all excellent news for the US national cricket team, currently ranked a respectable 22nd in the world. In addition to increased interest and investment in the sport, World Cups also provide inspiration. Arguably, the most remarkable performances in the tournament just concluded came from Afghanistan, which broke into the sport’s top tier less than a decade ago, with none of the advantages now accruing to American cricket. There’s no reason the US team can’t, to mix sports metaphors again, swing for the fences.\n\nRead also:\n\nRugby’s new coaching era: From referee to physio, unconventional paths reshape the game\n\nSaudi money is the last thing cricket needs – Adam Minter\n\nMeet Vince van der Bijl – cricket icon with a powerful message of hope for SA\n\n© 2023 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nVisited 1,395 times, 4 visit(s) today"

The tournament will be played between six teams, four out of which are either partly or fully owned by existing Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises.\n\nKolkata Knight Riders were one of the first investors in the tournament and own the Los Angeles-based team, while Mumbai Indians will be solely responsible for the New York-based franchise. Delhi Capitals meanwhile have joined hands with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and will co-own the Seattle-based franchise which will be called Seattle Orcas. The fourth IPL team to have a stake in the MLC is Chennai Super Kings, who will co-own the Texas-based franchise.\n\nThe remaining two teams – one based out of Washington DC and another out of San Franciso – are owned by local American investors in tie-ups with New South Wales Cricket and Victoria Cricket respectively.\n\nThe teams will create the domestic core of their squads today as the domestic player draft is set to take place at the Space Center Houston, the official Visitor Center of NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nFormat of the draft\n\nThere will be a total of nine rounds in the draft, with each team picking a player per round. The teams will follow a ‘snake order’ where the team which picks last in one particular round will pick first in the next.\n\nEach team will have to mandatorily pick a U-23 player in the ninth round, irrespective of whether they have picked one in earlier rounds or not.\n\nThe teams will get a shot at picking another U-23 domestic player in July, after the first half of the Minor League Cricket season, in a similar draft process. The overseas player signings will be done outside the draft process, with each team allowed a maximum of eight overseas players in their squad. The maximum squad strength is 18.\n\nTop players\n\nThere will be several international stars in the domestic player draft today (March 19), who have acquired local residencies. Two of the biggest names up for grabs will be World Cup winner Liam Plunkett, and seam-bowling all-rounder Corey Anderson. India U19 World Cup-winning captain Unmukt Chand will also be a part of the draft, along with his teammates from that squad Harmeet Singh and Smit Patel.\n\nMembers of the US national cricket team including the likes of Saurabh Netravalkar, Nosthush Kenjige, and Aaron Jones, will also be highly sought after in the draft. Saurabh has the best economy rate among pacers in two years of Minor League Cricket, Kenjige has an economy rate of 3.79 in the Cricket World Cup League 2 since 2020, and Jones had a 395-run season in Minor League Cricket (MiLC) last year at a strike rate of 151.\n\nSome of the other Minor League Cricket performers to keep an eye on include Hammad Azam, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of MiLC 2021, Phani Simhadri, the MVP of MiLC 2022, and Sujith Gowda, who has more than 1000 runs in the two seasons of the MiLC combined at a strike rate of nearly 150.\n\nTimings\n\nThe live broadcast of the draft will begin at 7:30pm local time (CST). Fans in India and Pakistan will be able to catch the action early morning on March 20 at 6am IST and 5:30 am PKT respectively. For viewers in the United Kingdon, the coverage will start at 12:30 am (GMT) on March 20."

Cricket Victoria representatives will be in attendance at the MLC Player Draft, as they assist in compiling a talented squad for the Unicorns ahead of MLC’s inaugural season.\n\n“The San Francisco Bay Area is a true hotbed for cricket and we can’t wait to represent the entire area with the Unicorns competing in the historic Major League Cricket event this summer,” said Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, lead investors in the San Francisco team. “In the 21st century, the term ‘unicorn’ has been used to denote exceptional talent or potential, whether it be a sportsperson or a Silicon Valley startup. Our San Francisco Unicorns have an extraordinary opportunity to represent all the fans of the world’s second largest sport in the Bay Area in a special and unique fashion on and off the field.”\n\nWhile San Francisco will not host home matches in the 2023 season, MLC and the Unicorns are aiming to build a world-class home for the team in the Bay Area. Feasibility studies for a development on a 14-acre site on the Santa Clara Fairgrounds in San José is currently underway in partnership with Santa Clara County. The stadium would seat up to 15,000 people and be capable of hosting major international cricket events. Other plans for the complex include state-of-the-art training facilities, locker rooms, luxury suites, dedicated parking and an international grade pitch to meet International Cricket Council accreditation."

        "body": "“Deep in the Heart of Texas”, a popular song about Texas, blared from the speakers during a timeout a few days into the debut of a US professional cricket league near Dallas.\n\nFans waved the flags of the Texas Super Kings and the LA Knight Riders, with some wearing the jerseys of their favorite countries or clubs overseas. A couple had ballcaps of two of the biggest brands in the United States – the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys and Major League Baseball’s New York Yankees.\n\nMajor League Cricket’s debut\n\nThis unusual confluence comes during the debut of Major League Cricket, which is hoping to find a foothold for one of the world’s most popular sports in a sports-mad country that knows little about the other bat-and-ball game.\n\nBecause of a willing partner happy to see a fading minor league baseball stadium turned into one of the few legitimate cricket pitches in the country, the league made its start in Texas, famous for the Friday night lights of high school football. The 7,000-seat stadium is in Grand Prairie, not far from where the Dallas Cowboys football team play in front of 90,000-plus fans eight or nine times every fall under a retractable roof with a giant video board hanging over the field.\n\nAlso read: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023: Schedule, squads, format, live TV, streaming, match times in IST\n\n“Some days I think we’re crazy,” tournament director Justin Geale said. “We’re in the middle of Dallas and we’ve got a cricket ground. I saw the vision. I got very excited. I got goose bumps when I first came in here. I thought, We can do this.”\n\n3 IPL owners in the fray\n\nAs with many things, money is the key, and co-founder Sameer Mehta said investors behind the initial $120 million aren’t expecting to turn a profit for several years, if then. Much of the money is coming from India, where arguably the best T20 cricket, the three-hour version that most closely resembles baseball, is played in the Indian Premier League. Three IPL owners are helping run US teams.\n\nWith a salary cap that’s competitive with similar T20 tournaments around the world, Major League Cricket organisers secured most of the better-known players they pursued, including Texas Super Kings captain Faf du Plessis.\n\nThe South African was swarmed by autograph seekers during a match against Washington when his playing time was finished. There are US players as well on rosters that allow six spots for international veterans. Mehta said he had no concerns about the quality of play even without IPL players because of rules preventing them from being in the US.\n\nAlso read: Major League Cricket (MLC): Fleming to be Texas Super Kings coach\n\n“There’s some bloody good players out there, especially with the IPL owning some of the franchises here, they bring across some international players,” said Australia’s Matthew Short, the player of the match for Washington in a victory over Texas. “As the tournament gets on the next couple of years, I think it’s important we get those players here and really bring up the local guys here as well.”\n\nPriyank Shah, a native of India who has been working and studying in the US for six years, shouted toward the players he recognised as they walked to and from the locker room. There were plenty of them.\n\n“Besides Indian players, the other players who are playing here, they are like rock stars,” said Shah, who lives in the Dallas area, the metropolitan region that is seeing explosive growth in its Asian population.\n\nThe first eight matches in the six-team tournament were in Texas, with seven more set for Morrisville, North Carolina. The event returns to the Dallas area for elimination games, with the championship match on July 30.\n\nFor now, the league’s six cities, Washington, Seattle, New York, and San Francisco included, are merely represented by the players. The goal is a home-and-home league, with 30 matches per team spanning roughly two months, but that’s several years off. Mehta said the clubs are contractually obligated to open venues within five years.\n\nThe 2024 plan calls for another tournament format, perhaps with two more venues. And organisers hope to build off the T20 World Cup, which will be held in part in the US for the first time.\n\nFive-year growth program\n\nGeale is hopeful cricket will be added as an Olympic sport for 2028, when the Games are in Los Angeles.\n\n“All of a sudden, we’ve got this five-year growth program for the sport,” Geale said. “A big part of what we’re trying to do is strengthen the USA national team.”\n\nAnother part of the growth plan is more grass roots, which Mehta said will take time. Youth and recreational leagues will be crucial to the US becoming more competitive internationally.\n\nAnd while Houston has a strong-enough presence in cricket to have hosted training camps leading to the Major League Cricket debut, the league will need similar facilities in the six cities with teams.\n\nCricket in the US has to fight against heavy odds\n\n“The odds are stacked against us,” Geale said. “We’re trying to launch a new sport in a country that doesn’t know it needs it. I think we need to be realistic. But I think if we can showcase how cool we think the game is, if we can put out a really good TV product, we can get that to people in America and the world to show this is going to work.”\n\nThere are plenty of examples of how Geale and Mehta want to Americanise the sport. One of the best is the ball going into the stands for the cricket version of a home run – all of them are homers since the game is played over all 360 degrees of a circular field.\n\n“Baseball fans are used to keeping those balls. Cricket fans are conditioned to throw them back because the sanctity of play is that the same ball has to be used unless of course (it’s) out of shape,” Mehta said.\n\nAlso read: Ahead of IPL 2023, CSK eyeing stake in Major League Cricket’s Texas team\n\nOne day, Geale would love for fans to keep the balls. For now, he was worried about that for the debut but didn’t need to be. Fans promptly tossed the balls back, which made sense considering what Mehta said about marketing. The target for the debut was ex-patriots of countries in South Asia and the Caribbean, along with Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThat’s another part of the short-term plan.\n\n“What I would love to do is for these fans to quickly bring their friends, family, associates, colleagues along to a game and have them sample this,” Mehta said. “But it’s OK if it takes another year. And by next year, we’ll be doing a lot of general marketing, trying to reach out to mainstream American sports fans.”\n\nThere were a few of those fans in the tournament’s first few days, including Dan Strick. The Dallas-area resident who got hooked on cricket through TV about a year ago brought his son to see a match.\n\n“Based on a year and a half of experience, I’ve only watched the best teams in the world play,” Strick said. “So obviously this might be a little poorer. But it’s still fun.”\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

        "body": "When Major League Cricket’s first game gets under way today (July 13) at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas, it will, on paper, be a battle between the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nSeasoned cricket watchers will know better, though. They’ll be able to see it as a continuation of the contest between Chennai and Kolkata, two Indian cities that field similarly named franchises in the 15-year-old Indian Premier League (IPL). The Chennai Super Kings won the 2023 edition of the IPL.\n\nTwo other teams out of the six in the US league are owned by IPL franchises as well: the Seattle Orcas, an offshoot of the Delhi Capitals; and the awkwardly named Mumbai Indians New York, sprung from the Mumbai Indians. Many of the players in these teams are imports as well: globetrotting freelancers who have already plied their trade in the IPL.\n\nIs the US ready for cricket?\n\nTo rope the wealthy US market into world cricket has been something of a dream for cricketing authorities for decades. But the sport has suffered from the reputation that its rules are byzantine and its matches epically long—the longest version of it, after all, lasts five days. A game of T20 cricket, though, of the kind seen in the IPL and the MLC, operates along simpler rules and is roughly as long as the average baseball game. If there’s any kind of cricket that will lure Americans, T20 is likely to be it.\n\nBut MLC still feels like a transplant, not least because of where its players and team owners come from. More specifically, it feels like a tentacular expansion of the IPL, the world’s most lucrative sports championship after the National Football League.\n\nSince India’s national stars turn out in international fixtures for most of the year, the IPL only lasts two months. To keep the money rolling in, the owners of IPL teams—a Chennai-based cement giant, for example, or Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance conglomerate—started buying franchises overseas. All six teams in South Africa’s SA20 league are spinoffs of IPL teams, as are three out of the six teams in the United Arab Emirates’ International League.\n\nMajor League Cricket is too Indian to be a hit in the US\n\nThe MLC still has a few distinctly American elements. It functions as the big brother to Minor League Cricket, in which 26 teams are owned by local individuals or companies. The investors in the $120 million MLC include Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft and a noted cricket nut; Ross Perot Jr.; and several people of South Asian descent who have founded companies in the US."

        "body": "With KKR already involved, four of the six teams in the new US-based T20 league, Major League Cricket, will have owners from the IPL\n\nNagraj Gollapudi\n\n16-Mar-2023\n\nThree prominent IPL franchises have bought stakes in Major League Cricket (MLC), a new T20 franchise league in the USA, which is scheduled to be launched this July. Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals, ESPNcricinfo has learned, have all bought stake in the MLC and will anchor franchises in New York, Texas and Seattle respectively.\n\nThat means four out of the six teams in MLC overall will be helmed by IPL franchises, after Kolkata Knight Riders, one of the earliest investors in the tournament, took charge of the Los Angeles franchise. While Mumbai, like Knight Riders, will run the New York franchise on its own, Capitals will run the Seattle franchise in partnership with Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella. While Capitals in the IPL is co-owned by the GMR Sports Private Ltd and Jindal Sports West, it is learned that it is the former that has entered into a partnership with Nadella to run the Seattle franchsie.\n\nIn a media release issued on Thursday, the MLC confirmed the alliance between Seattle franchise and Capitals, and said the team would be called Seattle Orcas. Other than Nadella and GMR, the other investors in the Orcas franchise comprise Soma Somasegar (managing director of Madrona Ventures), Samir Bodas (co-founder and CEO, Icertis), Ashok Krishnamurthi (managing partner, GreatPoint Ventures) and Sanjay Parthasarathy (former senior executive at Microsoft and Avalara).\n\nSuper Kings, too, have allied with a local investor in the Texas franchise.\n\nRelated\n\nMLC gets official ICC sanction ahead of July launch this year\n\nHales hopeful of featuring in MLC amid NOC doubts\n\nHarmeet Singh goes first in MLC Draft to Seattle Orcas; Ali Khan and Unmukt Chand snapped by LA Knight Riders\n\nMLC set to launch with draft on March 9 at NASA's Johnson Space Center\n\nMajor League Cricket set for July 2023 launch in Dallas\n\nThe two other franchises in the league are based out of Washington DC and San Francisco. The Washington DC franchise - to be called Washington Freedom - is owned by local American investor Sanjay Govil, who has tied up with New South Wales Cricket, to provide the operational expertise including helping set up the squad and putting a cricketing structure in place. A similar strategic tie-up has been struck between San Francisco franchise, owned by Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, and Cricket Victoria.\n\nThe development aligns with the constant endeavour of IPL franchises to expand their brands outside of India. All the four IPL franchises that have bought stakes in MLC are already part of more than one overseas domestic T20 franchise leagues. Outside of MLC, Mumbai own teams in South Africa's SA20 and the UAE-based International League T20 (ILT20), Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League and ILT20, Super Kings in SA20, and Capitals (GMR) in ILT20 and SA20.\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC will be played between July 13 and 30 at the newly renovated facility in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, Texas, with the player draft for local US players scheduled to be on March 19 at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. The squad size will comprise minimum 15 and maximum 18 players, of which nine can be overseas players. At least six players in the playing XI will need to be from the USA. The overseas players will be direct signings by the franchises, not part of the draft.\n\nIt is understood that teams will have a purse of USD 800,000 for overseas signings and USD 300,000 for the US-based players.\n\nNagraj Gollapudi is news editor at ESPNcricinfo"

When the 20-year-old isn’t studying at the University of Texas at Dallas, he’s trading his backpack for a uniform to train as a professional cricket player.\n\nSheikh was drafted in March by the Los Angeles Knight Riders, one of Major League Cricket’s six teams. Next week, the burgeoning sports league will launch its inaugural season with a kick-off match in Grand Prairie.\n\nWhen Sheikh moved to North Texas in 2015, he said there weren’t many cricket athletes, coaches or facilities to speak of. But as time went on, more and more folks started to catch the cricket bug.\n\n“I feel like where it is today is what I never imagined, with the stadium being built and all the international players that are going to be coming to Dallas,” he told the Observer. “It's a great opportunity for people like me, that have been raised in the U.S., especially in Dallas. I feel like cricket itself was never expected to be this popular.”\n\nThese days, the country seems to have a serious thirst for less-traditional sports.\n\nThere’s pickleball, of course. That pastime boasts some 36.5 million U.S. participants and has seen an average growth rate of nearly 160% over the past three years, according to the website Pickleheads.\n\nBut American cricket is giving pickleball a run for its money. In the U.S., millions of dollars are being poured into the sport, which ranks No. 2 in popularity worldwide, just behind soccer — or as the rest of the world calls it, football. The baseball-esque bat-and-ball game is adored by some 2.5 billion fans around the globe, especially in Asia, the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nPlenty of big names are investing in MLC, too, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Ross Perot Jr., the Dallas real estate developer, UT Dallas noted in a news release.\n\nSheikh has big plans for when he graduates next year.\n\n“Once I get my undergrad degree, then I'll basically be full-time cricket and hopefully see how far that takes me,” he said. “And then, worst-case scenario — or at the end of my cricket career — I can always fall back into my accounting degree.”\n\nThat cricket career could take him overseas to play in far-flung places like Sri Lanka, Pakistan and the Caribbean, he said.\n\n“It's only going to grow from here on out.” – Ali Sheikh, Major League Cricket player\n\ntweet this\n\nSheikh, who was drafted in the MLC’s sixth round, is apparently quite good, too.\n\n“There was an ‘Under-23’ category, which is the ninth round, so every player that was under 23 got drafted in that round,” he said. “But I was the only one to get drafted in the first eight rounds that was under 23, so that was kind of cool.”\n\nSheikh started playing cricket in Qatar, where he was born and raised. In Dallas, he has benefited from the guidance of a coach who’s a former international player from Pakistan.\n\nThe UT Dallas student will now get the chance to play with some of the biggest names in cricket, some of whom he watched growing up.\n\n“It's a great opportunity for me and great exposure to be playing at the highest level,” Sheikh said. “I feel like there's a lot to learn from and a lot to take out of this experience.”\n\nOn top of the physical demands, cricket players need to have plenty of mental stamina. Sheikh estimates that cricket is up to 85% a mental game thanks to how much strategy is involved.\n\nMatches are intense and can last for several hours, he said, and there are plenty of emotions arising throughout.\n\nIn fact, one of the longest sporting events in history was a cricket match that lasted 43 hours over the span of 12 days, according to Discover Magazine.\n\nLooking ahead, Sheikh believes that the future of cricket in the U.S. is bright.\n\n“This is just the start, with the [Grand Prairie] stadium being built and all the international players moving here,” he said. “I feel like it's going to skyrocket, with all the money and investments … and interest being shown.\n\n“It's only going to grow from here on out.”\n\nCatch the Los Angeles Knight Riders’ match against the Dallas-based Texas Super Kings at Grand Prairie Stadium next Thursday, July 13."

        "body": "Big-league cricket is coming to the USA - here's a primer on what to expect\n\nAshish Pant\n\n11-Jul-2023\n\n4:02\n\nJayawardene: The MLC will add more traction to cricket in the USA\n\nIt's time for Major League Cricket (MLC). The latest in an increasingly long line of franchise T20 tournaments, this one in the USA… Here's everything you need to know about it (but didn't know whom to ask).\n\nWhat! Another T20 league? Aren't there some 50 of these already out there?\n\nYes, but wait. This could be different. Franchise cricket is going to the USA for the first time, after all.\n\nIn the USA? Why? Do they even play cricket there?\n\nOf course they do. And as far back as ... 1844! In fact USA was part of the first cricket match involving two countries (as opposed to clubs or other domestic clashes). That was against Canada, at the St George's Cricket Club ground in New York.\n\nMore recently, the USA men's team was at the ODI World Cup qualifier in Zimbabwe. They did not win a single game, but reaching the qualifiers is an achievement in itself.\n\nThey have talented players in the system and this league can help grow the game there. The timing of the event is significant too, since USA and West Indies will host the men's T20 World Cup around this time next year. And, being the hosts, USA (and West Indies) have gained automatic qualification to that tournament.\n\nOkay, you have my attention now. Tell me more...\n\nMLC has been in the works for a while and, after multiple delays, it will finally see the light of day on July 13. It is being operated by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) and has been sanctioned by USA Cricket. The ICC has also given official sanction for the league.\n\nACE is backed by Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, founders of Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America, and Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain of the Times Group in India. MLC has received financial backing to the tune of US$ 120 million from a number of investors, including Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, and Shantanu Narayen, chairman and CEO of Adobe.\n\nRelated\n\nKieron Pollard: 'A lot of people are sprinting through those franchise doors'\n\nCricket's American dream takes flight - 'This season is about proving we can do it'\n\nSteven Smith in contention for Major League Cricket action in 2024\n\nMLC doesn't want to 'start a war with anyone'\n\nIt will be a short, crisp 19-game tournament - at least in the first season - with the first game on July 13 (July 14 in India, at 6am IST) and the final on July 30 (July 31 in India, at 6am IST).\n\nIn all, there will be 15 group-stage games followed by an eliminator, two qualifiers and the final. Six teams are in action and will start with a round-robin format, with the top four advancing to the playoffs. The format is similar to what they have at the IPL, but the teams will face each other only once in the league phase. Here's the full list of fixtures.\n\nSix teams, you say. Those are...?\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom.\n\nWhoa, hold on! Knight Riders, Super Kings, MI… sounds familiar.\n\nFour of the six teams are owned by IPL franchise owners.\n\nYou can tell who owns LA Knight Riders, MI Knight Riders and Texas Super Kings, right? And Seattle Orcas are owned by the GMR Group, who co-own Delhi Capitals. These groups own teams in other T20 leagues too, of course. And this raises the stakes even more.\n\nWashington Freedom are owned by Indian-American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil, and will have Cricket New South Wales as a high-performance partner. San Francisco Unicorns are owned by Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, and they have partnered with Cricket Victoria for their first season. It's all pretty serious business, as you can tell.\n\nAnd these matches will be played in?\n\nTwo venues. The first eight league games will be held at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas before the teams move to Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville for the next seven outings. The playoffs will be staged at Grand Prairie again.\n\nNever heard of these stadiums. Anything more on them?\n\nThe Grand Prairie is a former baseball park, and was redeveloped into a cricket stadium in 2022. The new stadium has a capacity of close to 7000. The other venue, Church Street Park, is in Morrisville, North Carolina, and has a capacity of around 3500, which can be expanded up to 5000.\n\nNothing in Fort Lauderdale? That's where they play international cricket, isn't it?\n\nYes, true, but two of the T20Is on India's tour of the Caribbean are being played there in August. So...\n\nBut will people come to watch?\n\nWe can only know once the games begin, but MLC recently announced that the tickets for the opening fixture between Texas and Los Angeles have been sold out. South Asian and Caribbean expats make up most of the cricket community there, and much of the USA national team, too. You'd expect them to come to watch.\n\nTickets can be bought from the MLC website.\n\nAnd where can we watch the games if not at the ground?\n\nIn the USA and Canada, it's on Willow TV. In India, it will be on Sports18 and Jio. If you are in Australia, MLC will be on Fox, SportsMax in the Caribbean, SKY NZ in New Zealand, A Sports in Pakistan, SuperSport in South Africa and BT Sport in the UK.\n\nWho are the big players in action?\n\nLos Angles have Jason Roy, Sunil Narine and Andre Russell. New York have Rashid Khan, Trent Boult and Kieron Pollard. San Francisco have Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis and Corey Anderson. Texas have Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway and David Miller. Seattle have Quinton de Kock, Shimron Hetmyer, Imad Wasim and Sikandar Raza. And Washington have Anrich Nortje and Marco Jansen.\n\nImpressive, eh? The full squads are here.\n\nCan they field as many overseas players as they want, or is there a cap?\n\nEach side can have a maximum of 19 and a minimum of 16 players on their roster. A maximum of nine international players are allowed in the squads. Each squad needs to have at least one USA Under-23 player, and must have at least ten domestic players, which is being done to give the next generation of American talents a chance to rub shoulders with the best.\n\nThe final playing XIs can have a maximum of six overseas players and five domestic players.\n\nSweet. How were the players drafted?\n\nThe domestic players were signed via a player draft, which was held at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston on March 19. Harmeet Singh, who was part of India's 2012 Under-19 World Cup-winning side, was the first pick, snapped up by Seattle. Steven Taylor was the first American-born player picked in the draft, by New York, while another former India U-19 start Unmukt Chand, who is in the USA now, went to Los Angeles.\n\nYou can read all about how the player draft went.\n\nAny other Indian players?\n\nApart from Chand and Harmeet, we have Chaitanya Bishnoi, Tajinder Singh, Shubham Ranjane and Smit Patel. All of these players have retired from the Indian domestic circuit. Ambati Rayudu was also slated to take part but withdrew in the wake of the BCCI's proposal to introduce a year-long cooling-off period for retired players before they can participate in overseas T20 leagues.\n\nThat's a bummer. Do we know the captains?\n\nYep, we do. Texas: Faf du Plessis. Los Angeles: Sunil Narine. Seattle: Wayne Parnell. New York: Kieron Pollard. San Francisco: Aaron Finch. Washington: Moises Henriques.\n\nLastly, these games will have T20 status?\n\nNo. While they are being played in the T20 format, the records will not reflect in the players' profiles because the USA - like the UAE, where the ILT20 is held - is not a Full-Member nation.\n\nAshish Pant is a sub-editor with ESPNcricinfo"

        "body": "USA’s Major League Cricket (MLC) has offered annual professional contracts to 11 USA national team players and rookie contracts to six other youth players.\n\nUSA’s MLC Offered Annual Professional Contracts\n\nIt is learnt that most of the players were offered the contracts during the recently concluded MLC Houston Challenge, a curtain-raiser for the American cricket summer that saw 3 MLC and a representative USA national side taking on one another in a series of practice games.\n\nIt is understood that USA selectors had given a list of 22 players that are part of USA’s scheme of things going forward and after much deliberation, MLC pruned down the list further.\n\nUSA’s batting mainstays captain Monank Patel and vice-captain Aaron Jones duly made the cut along with senior batsmen Steven Taylor, Jaskaran Malhotra and Gajanand Singh. Former captain Saurabh Netravalkar, Rusty Theron, Marty Kain and Ali Khan, who came back to USA fold last year after a brief hiatus from the national team, have also been made an offer.\n\nIan Holland, who is expected to spend most of the American summer playing for Hampshire, and Cameron Stevenson, who last played for USA in February 2020, have also made the cut.\n\nSalary for the Players\n\nThe youth contracts offered by MLC are another step up to their extensive investment in youth cricketing ecosystems.\n\nThe investment into housing professional players as mentors into yourth academies, national coaching clinics and fast-tracking of players into their respective minor league sides is now reaping rewards with the ongoing success of players like Sai Teja Mukkamalla, Under-19 captain Ali Sheikh, Rahul Jariwala, Vatsal Vaghela and Sanjay Krishnamurthy. The youth contracts are understood to be in excess of $10,000.\n\nThe report states that these professional contracts that have been offered range from $55,000 to $40,000 per year, a far cry from the $24,000 annual fee currently paid by US cricket.\n\nAmerican cricketers have been held back on these meager deductions since the start of covid, having been subjected to pay cuts of more than 50%, players turned to semi-professionals and were forced to seek employment other jobs while the council’s administrative payroll has seen a climb up.\n\n“This is a robust step towards ensuring a pool of USA qualified players are professionally contracted and available for national team duties.\n\nMLC intends to assist these players with their professional development through access to infrastructure, exposure to high-quality tournaments and training environments, and a support structure that consists of advisors, talent representation, specialist coaches, physios etc.\n\nThis improves the quality of domestic players available for Major League Cricket’s inaugural season in 2023, and keeps the USA on track to field a very competitive team in the 2024 World Cup” said Mehta.\n\nHow Can a Player Acquire MLC contracts?\n\nMLC contracts will require players to attend semi-professional MLC minor league cricket T20 and two other MLC-recognized T20 pop-up national events. Although these contracts do not involve playing the first MLC T20 in 2023, MLC’s Sameer Mehta believes it is a step in the right direction to develop and condition players for the rigors of professional cricket that await them."

        "body": "When Sanjay Parthasarathy left his last tech job in February 2023, he figured he’d do what he could to help get the first season of Major League Cricket up and running in the Seattle area and at the national level. After that, it would probably be time to go find another “real job,” as he put it.\n\nJust over a year later, Parthasarathy, one of several notable names from the region’s tech industry who are backing the Seattle Orcas, is beyond just getting things off the ground. He’s become fully immersed in the business of the sport he once played as a professional.\n\n“I’ve done a startup. It was 10x a startup kind of pace and velocity,” Parthasarathy said of the inaugural season for the league and the Orcas. “I’ve played cricket my entire life. Running a team — that was something else.”\n\nThe Orcas lead investor group includes Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Madrona Venture Group Managing Director S. Soma Somasegar; Icertis co-founder and CEO Samir Bodas; and GreatPoint Ventures managing partner Ashok Krishnamurthi. Indian conglomerate GMR Group also has a stake.\n\nParthasarathy was a longtime Microsoft executive before founding and leading Indix in 2012. The AI and machine learning startup was acquired by tax software giant Avalara in 2019, which was in turn acquired by Vista Equity Partners in 2022. Parthasarathy stepped down from his role as Avalara’s chief product officer last year.\n\nIn retrospect, the 2023 cricket season went much better than he and others expected. Parthasarathy said the effort probably accelerated cricket in the U.S. by two or three years. Not bad, considering the goal was “just to survive the season.”\n\nMLC and its six teams — Seattle, Texas, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. — attracted fan and broadcast interest. And the Orcas finished as runners up in the short season of Twenty20 cricket that wrapped up outside Dallas last July.\n\nThere are several goals this season and none seem to faze Parthasarathy’s enthusiasm for what’s possible. Those goals include:\n\nMake the Orcas ‘America’s favorite cricket team’\n\nParthasarathy said the Orcas decided from the start to be loud, different, and fun.\n\nThe team boasts a core group of fans from around the Seattle area, including many Asian Indians from the tech community. But as the smallest of the six MLC markets, the Orcas want to grow their base by attracting fans in cities across the U.S.\n\nA redesign of the team’s original, quickly conceived logo added a cricket bat and crown (for King County) to the playful orca mascot. Fans took notice last summer, and Orcas merchandise was a hit.\n\n“Every adult has their favorite team, but if you look at all the kids in the stadiums, they all have Seattle Orcas [jerseys],” Parthasarathy said. “That’s who we need to reach out to as a team.”\n\nBroaden the fan base\n\n“We have product market fit — just to use a traditional startup term — with the core audience,” Parthasarathy said, referencing 30- to 40-year-old males tied to what he calls “the Commonwealth diaspora” — India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand and England.\n\nTo reach a broader base of U.S. fans used to professional baseball, football, basketball and more, it’s about getting cricket in front of people.\n\n“If people are aware of it and they actually go watch, they’ll get hooked,” he said. “Is that going to take three years, seven years, 10 years? Probably. We’ve got to do out-of-the-box things to attract attention and just be different. Because if people watch it, they’ll enjoy it.”\n\nGrow the sport at grassroots level\n\nReferencing the popularity of the NBA, and basketball in general, Parthasarathy said there are pickup games in gyms, parks and home courts all around the country.\n\n“We don’t have enough pickup games in cricket,” he said. “If you go to India, there’s pickup cricket going all the time, everywhere. How do we get from here to there? I call that grassroots development. … It doesn’t take much to get started. Don’t worry about the rules. Don’t worry about the technicalities. Just start to play. It’s see ball, hit ball, right? That’s where it starts.”\n\nPrepare U.S. for strong showing at 2028 Olympics\n\nEven though it’s regarded as the second-most-popular sport in the world (behind soccer), cricket last appeared at the Olympics in 1900, at the Paris Games. In October, the International Olympic Committee approved the addition of the sport for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, and Parthasarathy called it a pivotal development, especially on the heels of the U.S. hosting matches for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.\n\n“How do we get from Major League Cricket to the Olympics? That’s the journey that is most interesting, because you’ve got to get grassroots awareness and you’ve got to get the domestic team playing at a reasonable level,” Parthasarathy said.\n\nContinue work on bringing a cricket ground to Seattle area\n\nTwo years ago, the King County Council passed a motion of support for the development of a cricket grounds at Marymoor Park in Redmond. Parthasarathy said discussions between MLC and the county and cities involved are ongoing.\n\n“If we take a phased approach, we’re hoping we can get games going in this area in 2025,” he said. “But a lot of stars have to align to make that happen.”\n\nMLC and the Orcas ownership group wants the grounds to be a community resource.\n\n“This is not just going to be like the traditional approaches that we have with baseball stadiums and football stadiums,” Parthasarathy said. “There’s a lot more nuances and benefits to both sides that need to be worked out.”"

        "body": "American cricket finds serious backers\n\nIn a historic first for cricket lovers in the U.S., Grand Prairie, Texas, and Morrisville, North Carolina, will host the inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC) starting July 13. Backed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Indian Premier League franchises, and desi tech heavyweights like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the tournament is expected to create the right kind of buzz for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, 2024, to be hosted by the United States and the West Indies.\n\nUSA Cricket set the ball rolling for the MLC a few years back by creating Minor League Cricket, which had its inaugural season in 2021. Many of the top performers in the minor league have found spots on MLC teams. This is the game-changing opportunity American cricket enthusiasts have been waiting for: each team has to field at least six domestic players in its playing 11.\n\nHowever, as an aspiring American cricketer myself, I was disappointed to see that not many truly homegrown domestic players have been selected. Noteworthy players like Rahul Jariwala and Vatsal Vaghela have been left out. Both of them received USA Cricket’s Emerging Player Scholarship but failed to make it on a team. Jariwala and Vaghela played in the Minor League tournament and made significant contributions to their teams.\n\nEven so, there’s much to celebrate, as the tournament is a giant leap for American cricket.\n\nSix teams from across the U.S. to battle it out\n\nThere are six teams across the United States: Washington Freedom, Texas Super Kings, MI New York, LA Knight Riders, Seattle Orcas, and the San Francisco Unicorns. Among these teams, the Texas Super Kings, MI New York, and the LA Knight Riders are owned by IPL franchises. The IPL is the world’s second-richest sports league, bested only by the NFL.\n\nWhile the games this season will be split between Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park, in Morrisville, North Carolina, each team is expected to have its own home stadium in the future.\n\nThere will be 19 group-stage matches, and the top four teams will make it to the playoffs. Much like the IPL format, the top teams will play an eliminator, qualifier, challenger, and then the final match to decide the winner of the tournament.\n\nTeams USA\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nFaf du Plessis (Captain), Milind Kumar, Sami Aslam, Cody Chetty, Saiteja Mukkamalla, David Miller, Devon Conway, Calvin Savage, Zia Shahzad, Dwayne Bravo, Daniel Sams, Mitchell Santner, Lahiru Milantha, Rusty Theron, Cameron Stevenson, Gerald Coetzee\n\nTSK has put together a good team, with many former and current IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings players.\n\nBatting: They have one of the strongest opening partnerships, with Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway. David Miller, a phenomenal finisher who is in amazing form is also on the roster.\n\nBowling: On the bowling front, they have a few bowling all-rounders, such as Rusty Theron, Cameron Stevenson, and Calvin Savage. They also have CSK’s own Dwayne Bravo, and the young Gerald Coetzee.\n\nDomestic talent: With their U19 selection in the draft, they picked Saiteja Mukkamalla. He is a great player, and has wonderful technique and timing, but might struggle with his strike rate. They also have Milind Kumar and Lahiru Milantha, who are both good domestic batters.\n\nWeak link: One area that might be lacking is their spin bowling department. Besides Mitchell Santner, they only have Zia Shahzad, a wrist spinner.\n\nX-factor: Daniel Sams. Sams is a good fast bowler, and can also bat. TSK will be hoping that he can execute both of these abilities.\n\nMI New York\n\nKieron Pollard (Captain), Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Tim David, David Wiese, Dewald Brevis, Monank Patel, Saideep Ganesh, Nicholas Pooran, Kyle Philip, Ehsan Adil, Nosthush Kenjige, Sarbjit Ladda, Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Jason Behrendorff, Rashid Khan\n\nMI New York has a star-studded team.\n\nBatting: This team has some of the best finishers in world cricket in Nicholas Pooran, Tim David, and Kieron Pollard.\n\nBowling: An amazing fast bowling lineup that includes Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult, and Jason Behrendorff. They also have Rashid Khan, the best spinner in international cricket.\n\nDomestic Talent: They have the USA captain, Monank Patel, and Steven Taylor, who is arguably the best batter on Team USA and an aggressive left-hander.\n\nWeak Link: Their top order – they will have to rely on their domestic players to perform.\n\nX-factor: Twenty-year-old Dewald Brevis Brevis has been nicknamed Baby AB for his 360-degree shots.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nWayne Parnell (Captain), Shehan Jayasuriya, Aaron Jones, Nauman Anwar, Angelo Perera, Harmeet Singh, Shubham Ranjane, Cameron Gannon, Mitchell Marsh, Dasun Shanaka, Sikandar Raza, Quinton de Kock, Phani Simhadri, Matthew Tromp, Andrew Tye\n\nThe Orcas have built a very balanced team.\n\nBatting: Their overseas talent includes Quinton de Kock and Mitchell Marsh, both of whom are among the most powerful players in world cricket. Sri Lankan captain, Dasun Shanaka, brings his vast experience to the Orcas. Sikandar Raza picked up the 4th highest number of wickets and scored the 5th highest number of runs in the 2022 T20 World Cup.\n\nBowling: Marsh, Shanaka, and Raza, are all batters with terrific bowling talent, giving the Orcas a good amount of flexibility.\n\nDomestic Talent: Shehan Jayasuriya and Aaron Jones are both US domestic batters with international experience.\n\nWeak Link: They don’t have enough specialist bowlers, which might hold them back.\n\nX-factor: Shehan Jayasuriya. The Orcas will be hoping that Jayasuriya will bring his excellent form in Minor League Cricket to MCL this season.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nAaron Finch (Captain), Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, Qais Ahmed, Finn Allen, Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Lungi Ngidi, Corey Anderson, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Brody Couch, Sanjay Krishnamurti, Carmi Leroux, Smit Patel, Liam Plunkett, Tajinder Singh, David White\n\nThe Unicorns went for veteran players in the draft.\n\nBatting: With their overseas selections, they chose to build a strong top order, with Aaron Finch, Matthew Wade, and Marcus Stoinis.\n\nBowling: The Unicorns have a strong bowling attack, including Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Lungi Ngidi, and Qais Ahmed. Veteran Liam Plunkett joins them as well.\n\nDomestic Players: With their U19 selection, the Unicorns picked Sanjay Krishnamurti, who bowls left-arm orthodox, and can also bat.\n\nWeak Link: The team lacks finishers. They might have to shuffle their batting order around to use either Stoinis or Wade as a finishing option.\n\nX-factor: Corey Anderson. At the peak of his powers, Anderson was a scary batter, and a good bowler. If Anderson can return to form, the Unicorns will be an improved team.\n\nLA Knight Riders\n\nSunil Narine (Captain), Jaskaran Malhotra, Jason Roy, Martin Guptill, Nitish Kumar, Rilee Rossouw, Saif Badar, Unmukt Chand, Ali Sheikh, Andre Russell, Bhaskar Yadram, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Adam Zampa, Ali Khan, Corne Dry, Lockie Ferguson\n\nThe Knights signed many Kolkata Knight Riders players, including Andre Russell, and Sunil Narine.\n\nBatting: The Knights team has a very strong batting attack, with plenty of options at their disposal. The ones to look out for are Jason Roy, Martin Guptill (New Zealand), and Rilee Rossouw from South Africa.\n\nBowling: Lockie Ferguson is a threatening pacer, and is currently one of the fastest in the world. Adam Zampa is a fantastic spinner.\n\nDomestic talent: Ali Khan and Shadley van Schalkwyk are both fast bowlers with experience playing against top-tier talent.\n\nX-factor: Ali Sheikh. This is one of my favorite picks. He has been on selectors’ radars for a while now and was the earliest U19 selection in the draft. Sheikh has huge potential and is the best homegrown player from the US. In U19 cricket, he scored a century in 60 balls and piled up a ton of runs in youth cricket. He can also bowl a handy left-arm orthodox, which should be helpful for the Knight Riders.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nMoises Henriques (Captain), Mukhtar Ahmed, Saad Ali, Sujith Gowda, Jacobus Pienaar, Justin Dill, Anrich Nortje, Saurabh Netravalkar, Dane Piedt, Marco Jansen, Akhilesh Bodugum, Adam Milne, Ben Dwarshuis, Akeal Hosein, Andries Gous, Glenn Phillips, Josh Philippe\n\nBatting: The team has some fearless players such as Glenn Phillips. Josh Philippe, an opening batsman-keeper, has scored many runs in Australia’s Big Bash League. Moises Henriques is also a powerful addition to their team.\n\nBowling: The Washington Freedom has some of the fastest bowlers currently in world cricket. Anrich Nortje, Adam Milne, and Marco Jansen can hit speeds as high as 155 kilometers per hour. Akeal Hosein heads their spinners. Hosein is a crafty bowler and does not give away too many runs.\n\nDomestic players: Their most notable picks were Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar. Gous is an attacking batter and has played in overseas leagues such as the Abu Dhabi T20 competition. Netravalkar is a left-arm pacer who gets awesome swings when he bowls with the new ball.\n\nWeak link: Spin bowling. Other than Akeal Hosein, the only player with real international experience is Dane Piedt.\n\nX-factor: Saurabh Netravalkar. Netravalkar has shown that he can stand up to top talent.\n\nAdi’s Crystal Ball Rankings\n\nMI New York\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nLA Knight Riders\n\nChampion: MI New York\n\nWho’s your favorite team?"

A couple had ballcaps of two of the biggest brands in the United States — the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and Major League Baseball 's New York Yankees.\n\nThis unusual confluence comes during the debut of Major League Cricket , which is hoping to find a foothold for one of the world's most popular sports in a sports-mad country that knows little about the “other” bat-and-ball game.\n\nBecause of a willing partner happy to see a fading minor league baseball stadium turned into one of the few legitimate cricket pitches in the country, the league made its start in Texas, famous for the Friday night lights of high school football. The 7,000-seat stadium is in Grand Prairie, not far from where the Cowboys — America's Team, remember — play in front of 90,000-plus eight or nine times every fall under a retractable roof with a giant video board hanging over the field.\n\n“Some days I think we’re crazy,” tournament director Justin Geale said. “We’re in the middle of Dallas and we’ve got a cricket ground. I saw the vision. I got very excited. I got goose bumps when I first came in here. I thought, ‘We can do this.’”\n\nAs with many things, money is the key, and co-founder Sameer Mehta said investors behind the initial $120 million aren't expecting to turn a profit for several years, if then. Much of the money is coming from India, where arguably the best T20 cricket — the three-hour version that most closely resembles baseball — is played in the India Premier League. Three IPL owners are helping run U.S. teams.\n\nWith a salary cap that's competitive with similar T20 tournaments around the world, Major League Cricket organizers secured most of the better-known players they pursued, including Texas Super Kings captain Faf du Plessis.\n\nThe South African was swarmed by autograph seekers during a match against Washington when his playing time was finished. There are U.S. players as well on rosters that allow six spots for international veterans. Mehta said he had no concerns about the quality of play even without IPL players because of rules preventing them from being here.\n\n“There’s some bloody good players out there, especially with the IPL owning some of the franchises here, they bring across some international players,” said Australia's Matthew Short, the player of the match for Washington in a victory over Texas. “As the tournament gets on the next couple of years, I think it’s important we get those players here and really bring up the local guys here as well.”\n\nPriyank Shah, a native of India who has been working and studying in the U.S. for six years, shouted toward the players he recognized as they walked to and from the locker room. There were plenty of them.\n\n“Besides Indian players, the other players who are playing here, they are like rock stars,” said Shah, who lives in the Dallas area, the metropolitan region that is seeing explosive growth in its Asian population.\n\nThe first eight matches in the six-team tournament were in Texas, with seven more set for Morrisville, North Carolina. The event returns to the Dallas area for elimination games, with the championship July 30.\n\nMLC Trophy (Photo Credit: Major League Cricket)\n\nFor now, the league's six cities — Washington, Seattle, New York and San Francisco included — are merely represented by the players. The goal is a home-and-home league, with 30 matches per team spanning roughly two months, but that's several years off. Mehta said the clubs are contractually obligated to open venues within five years.\n\nThe 2024 plan calls for another tournament format, perhaps with two more venues. And organizers hope to build off the T20 World Cup, which will be held in part in the U.S. for the first time.\n\nGeale is hopeful cricket will be added as an Olympic sport for 2028, when the Games are in Los Angeles.\n\n“All of a sudden, we’ve got this five-year growth program for the sport,” Geale said. “A big part of what we’re trying to do is strengthen the USA national team.”\n\nAnother part of the growth plan is more grass roots, which Mehta said will take time. Youth and recreational leagues will be crucial to the U.S. becoming more competitive internationally.\n\nAnd while Houston has a strong enough presence in cricket to have hosted training camps leading to the Major League Cricket debut, the league will need similar facilities in the six cities with teams.\n\n“The odds are stacked against us,” Geale said. “We’re trying to launch a new sport in a country that doesn’t know it needs it. I think we need to be realistic. But I think if we can showcase how cool we think the game is, if we can put out a really good TV product, we can get that to people in America and the world to show this is going to work.”\n\nThere are plenty of examples of how Geale and Mehta want to “Americanize” the sport. One of the best is the ball going into the stands for the cricket version of a home run — all of them are homers since the game is played over all 360 degrees of a circular field.\n\nBaseball fans are used to keeping those balls. Cricket fans are conditioned to throw them back because of the “sanctity of play is that the same ball has to be used unless of course (it's) out of shape,” Mehta said.\n\nOne day, Geale would love for fans to keep the balls. For now, he was worried about that for the debut — but didn't need to be. Fans promptly tossed the balls back, which made sense considering what Mehta said about marketing. The target for the debut was ex-patriots of countries in South Asia and the Caribbean, along with Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThat's another part of the short-term plan.\n\n“What I would love to do is for these fans to quickly bring their friends, family, associates, colleagues along to a game and have them sample this,” Mehta said. “But it’s OK if it takes another year. And by next year, we’ll be doing a lot of general marketing, trying to reach out to mainstream American sports fans.”\n\nThere were a few of those fans in the tournament's first few days, including Dan Strick. The Dallas-area resident who got hooked on cricket through TV about a year ago brought his son to see a match.\n\n“Based on a year and half of experience, I’ve only watched the best teams in the world play,” Strick said. “So obviously this might be a little poorer. But it’s still fun.”\n\nWatch live MLC action on Willow\n\n(You can book your MLC tickets HERE)\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nPhil Salt's knock propels KKR past DC\n\nsports\n\nChennai Super Kings blow away Sunrisers Hyderabad\n\nsports\n\nJacks hits ton as RCB crush GT by 9 wickets in IPL\n\nsports\n\nRajasthan beat Lucknow to near playoffs\n\nsports\n\nPunjab pull off record chase against Kolkata\n\nsports\n\nSpinners help RCB defeat SRH\n\nsports\n\nPant blitz leads DC win over GT\n\nsports\n\nUnbeaten Stoinis ton helps LSG beat CSK\n\nsports\n\nSandeep Sharma nails fifer as RR beat MI\n\nsports\n\nR Sai Kishore stars in GT's win over PBKS\n\nsports"

The much-awaited domestic player draft for the same was held yesterday (March 19) at the Space Center Houston, the official Visitor Center of NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nA total of 54 players were picked in the nine rounds of the draft.

        "body": "George Bernard Shaw asserted “the English are not very spiritual people so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.”\n\nIt has been a long game, traditionally.\n\nWhile cricket has flourished in England and some of its former colonies, it has never taken off to the same degree in the United States, where some have perceived it as impenetrable.\n\nA sport played in its purist form by players in long white uniforms, test cricket goes on for five days and still often ends with no winner, with days so long players twice have to leave the field for meals.\n\nMajor League Cricket, which begins on Thursday, could change that perception. For a start, the games only go for just over three hours.\n\nMLC will comprise six teams, from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, New York and Washington, which will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\n\nTeams will have a maximum of 19 and minimum of 16 players, combining international stars and home-grown players selected through a draft which was made when the league was launched, officially and metaphorically, at Space Center Houston. Each team was allowed to sign nine local players, one of which had to be under-23.\n\nThe salaries of international players will be drawn from an initial $120 million investment from corporate backers, mainly from India.\n\nThe teams will play Twenty20 style which might be portrayed as cricket with the dull bits removed. The format may be more appealing to the American sport palate because there is always a winner: if the teams are still tied after both innings — each comprising 20 six-ball overs — a tie-breaking “super over” is played to find the winner.\n\nMost matches will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, converted to a cricket stadium with 7,200 seats and a grass pitch. Other matches will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThe league follows the model of professional Twenty20 — or more broadly known as T20 — leagues which already exist in places such as India, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Canada. They’re all supported by a travelling troupe of international players — many of them T20 specialists — who give leagues marquee quality.\n\nThe most lucrative and glamorous of all these franchise competitions is the Indian Premier League, where the world’s best players are hired by teams owned by Bollywood stars, business giants and other celebrities. The gravitational pull of the IPL has reshaped cricket’s traditional schedules and made many new cricketing millionaires.\n\nMajor League Cricket inevitably will have some of the Indian Premier League glitz. Four of the six teams are owned and will be run by IPL franchises.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders will be run by the Knight Riders Group which operate the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. MI New York will be run by the Mumbai Indians, Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas by the GMR Group which runs the Delhi Capitals.\n\nTwo of Australia’s provincial organizations — Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales — will run the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom respectively.\n\nMany of the biggest stars from India, Australia and England are involved in test series — more of those five-day matches — but MLC has attracted a strong contingent of seasoned T20 performers.\n\nBollywood star Shah Rukh Khan co-owns the Knight Riders Group and has recruited West Indies stars Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, England’s Jason Roy, South Africa’s Rilee Rossouw, Australian Adam Zampa and New Zealanders Lockie Ferguson and Martin Guptill.\n\n“We have assembled a strong and talented team for the debut season of MLC who can compete at the highest level and bring joy to cricket fans around the world,” Knight Riders Group chief executive Venky Mysore said.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have hired South Africa’s Faf du Plessis as captain alongside international stars Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, David Miller, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee.\n\nChennai Super Kings chief executive K.S. Viswanathan said du Plessis “led the Joburg Super Kings at (the South African T20 league) from the front earlier this year and we’re confident of doing well under him in Texas.”\n\nThe West Indies and Mumbai Indians star Kieron Pollard will captain New York, which will have Robin Peterson as head coach and Lasith Malinga as bowling coach. Their signings include fast bowlers Trent Boult from New Zealand and Kagiso Rabada from South Africa.\n\nSeattle has Australian star Mitch Marsh and South Africa’s Quinton de Kock.\n\nMLC has broader ambitions, to build minor leagues in a bid to develop training and development facilities and support the U.S. national team.\n\nNow it remains to be seen whether American fans will find Major League Cricket to their taste and make the league itself everlasting."

The first game is the one that will set the tone for the rest of the season. Now imagine that this first game is the first event for the whole league, and there's a sold-out crowd. The pressure has to be tremendous.\n\n\"There's always a bit of pressure on the first game, but it's something I believe is gonna create something for the future, and to be a part of that I think firstly is very special as the team to play the opening game,\" David Miller of the Texas Super Kings says. \"It's special and a privileged position to be in, so to notch off a win as well is even better.\"\n\nThe Texas Super Kings faced that scenario on Thursday at the new cricket oval in Grand Prairie for its season-opening, 69-run win against the Los Angeles Knight Riders. The fans who filled the former home of the Texas AirHogs baseball team to capacity on Thursday will have 10 more chances to root for the home team now that the first official Major League Cricket (MLC) season is underway. According to the league, six of those games are sold out already.\n\n“The passion and excitement seen in the stands on the sold-out opening night of Major League Cricket on Thursday was amazing to behold,\" said MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan, \"and we can’t wait to see more full houses signaling the arrival of a new top-tier professional sports league in America.\"\n\nIf you're the kind of football-worshipping Texan who laughed at the initial idea of a professional cricket team in our backyard, you'd have to a hard time hanging on to that argument if you went to Thursday night's match. The stands were packed and decorated with yellow flags carrying the Super Kings lion logo as fans raised some hell to support their team on the pitch. These fans are invested in their teams and in the game, making for some dramatic tension and inspired celebrations. There were some lulls in the action in between bowls and bats — just like in baseball, where it can feel like an eternity waiting for a big hit or the chance to see a killer play. But it's different with cricket. You really have to zone in on every second because a hit wicket or a great catch can happen at just about any moment, and if your head isn't pointed toward the field, it's easy to miss.\n\nLate in the game, bowler Gerald Coetzee caught the Knight Riders off guard with a superb hit wicket in a matter of a second. The wicket and the poles lit up like fireworks as the wicket launched to the other end of the oval and the crowd roared. It was followed with fireworks that punctuated the achievement. If my head was turned in the other direction, there was no chance to catch it in action. Cricket demands your attention, and you can get lost in the action.\n\nEven the defensive plays are a thrill to watch. There are so many areas the fielders have to cover, so diving saves and sliding catches happen a lot more than just maybe once or twice a game.\n\nCricket definitely has a future in Texas. Just imagine how it would feel to have a championship team back in Dallas once again."

        "body": "Even before its inauguration, the Major League Cricket (MLC) has already sparked a ripple effect in international cricket. It happens to be a T20I cricket league that will be played in the United States of America from 13 July. A total of 6 teams will be playing in the league that has been sanctioned by USA Cricket and will be operated by American Cricket Enterprise.\n\nMatches will be held in Texas’ Prairie Grand Stadium and North Carolina’s Church Street Park. With the inaugural champions to be crowned on 13 July, MLC is seen as a great attempt to increase the popularity of cricket in America, where the sport has perhaps not made significant inroads yet.\n\nHere's all you need to know about the MLC:\n\nMany IPL teams are actively trying to broaden their horizons, with sister franchises in overseas leagues. Following the trend seen in the Caribbean Premier League, SA20 and also the International League T20, MLC is also set to be an IPL-dominated event, in terms of the franchise spread.\n\nChennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals (only GMR group) and Kolkata Knight Riders have all purchased teams in the MLC. Texas Super Kings will be seen representing IPL’s MS Dhoni-led five-time winners, Chennai, with another five-time champion, Mumbai Indians buying the New York franchise.\n\nMany renowned international players will be making appearances in MLC 2023, which promises to be an enthralling competition, according to the teams’ rosters. T20I cricket’s biggest superstars in Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Andre Russell, Quinton De Kock, Mitchell Marsh, Anrich Nortje, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Wanindu Hasaranga will be seen in action.\n\nWhile de Kock and Marsh will be seen in action for Seattle Orcas, Anrich Nortje and Wanindu Hasaranga will ply their trades for Washington Freedom. The Caribbean pair of Russell and Narine will represent the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nMLC will be held from 13 July to 30 July. The league will be held in two legs, with the first one, containing 8 league matches, to be held in Texas’ Grand Prairie Stadium, and the second one to take place at North Carolina’s Church Street Park.\n\nSalary caps for players picked in each round were fixed during the MLC draft. The players drafted in the first round have been acquired for $75,000, while the amount spent for the players drafted in the second, third and fourth rounds are $65,000, $50,000 and $40.000 respectively. The fifth, sixth and seventh and eighth rounds had a fixed salary cap of $35,000, $25,000, $15,000 and $10,000 respectively. The players bought during the ninth round, which was also the last round of the draft, were acquired for $2,500.\n\nEnglish opener Jason Roy, who also plays for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL, recently decided to terminate his incremental contract with the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB), in favour of a deal with the Los Angeles Knight Riders in MLC. This move has the potential to trigger a butterfly effect in international cricket, with many fearing players might choose franchise deals over national contracts, with many IPL franchises like the Knight Riders having teams across the globe, playing in multiple competitions.\n\nICC is also planning on imposing a new rule to restrict the participation of overseas cricketers. According to ESPNCricinfo, the new rule might make it mandatory for franchises to field a maximum of only four overseas players in the playing XI, which could have a dampening effect on MLC’s hype, considering the current laws allow each team to have six overseas stars in the playing XI."

        "body": "England are confident Ben Stokes remains “100 per cent committed” to international cricket, despite turning down a three-year central contract in favour of a 12-month extension.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board has introduced multi-year deals for the first time in a bid to guard against the growing influence of franchise leagues but Test captain Stokes has rejected an offer that would have tied him in until autumn 2026.\n\nInstead of taking the long-term security of an offer that would have been worth in the region of £3million – no small matter given his fitness issues in recent times – he has agreed another annual retainer and plans to renegotiate again next year.\n\nDirector of men’s cricket Rob Key, who has overseen the revamped system, is relaxed about the decision and believes Stokes is merely gambling on raising his future value at the bargaining table.\n\n“Ben was offered three, but he’s actually turned around now and said: ‘No, I think I’ll be in a stronger position next year’,” explained Key.\n\n“You might have more power if you have a good year to negotiate what you want. But he’s 100 per cent committed to playing for England, so I wouldn’t read into it the fact he signed one year that he’s not.\n\n“By no means is it Ben Stokes saying: ‘I don’t want to play for England’. All he talks about is being completely committed to playing for England and also captaining that Test team – planning for India, planning for the Ashes, planning for West Indies and Sri Lanka next summer. I don’t think it has crossed his mind not playing for England for the next four, five, six years.”\n\nA total of six three-year deals were offered – with Joe Root, Harry Brook and Mark Wood signing up, while white-ball captain Jos Buttler and injured seamer Jofra Archer have gone for a middle ground by taking two-year options.\n\nThere are 26 deals in all, spanning the age range from 19-year-old Rehan Ahmed to 41-year-old James Anderson. Fifteen are on two-year options, with eight on traditional 12-month terms and top-up payments handed to seam trio Matthew Fisher, Saqib Mahmood and the uncapped John Turner.\n\nNobody has refused to sign, but several may have been disappointed not to make the cut. David Willey is the only member of the World Cup squad in India not to make the list, highly-rated all-rounder Will Jacks was also omitted despite being capped in all three formats over the last year and Jason Roy is out after terminating the remainder of his previous deal to play Major League Cricket in the United States last summer.\n\nKey was speaking in Bengaluru, where England will be hoping to boost a dreadful World Cup campaign with victory over Sri Lanka on Thursday, and admitted having a tough conversation with Willey.\n\n“It’s fair to say David wasn’t best pleased, as you can understand, being the only one out here not to get a contract,” he said.\n\n“It’s bloody tough, to be honest. We’d love to live in a world where you can just say we have a pot of extra cash and you can just give him something because he’s come out for the World Cup.”\n\nKey believes the new raft of contracts have effectively safeguarded England’s interests at a time when the sports tectonic plates are shifting fast.\n\nThe spending power of the biggest Indian-backed T20 brands means international boards are struggling to compete and there has been a real fear at the ECB that its most prized assets could be lured away from the national set-up entirely.\n\n“You don’t know what the future holds with franchise cricket; you don’t know when the first year-long deal for an English cricketer is going to be offered from a franchise,” he said.\n\n“So I’m pretty pleased because I think for the first time in this changing landscape for cricket we start to see what players really think and what they really do. And we’ve seen that everyone’s committed to English cricket.\n\n“I don’t want a world where you see your best players going off and (only) playing franchise cricket. I want to see them playing for England.”\n\nThree-year deals:\n\nH Brook, J Root, M Wood.\n\nTwo-year deals:\n\nR Ahmed, J Archer, G Atkinson, J Bairstow, J Buttler, B Carse, Z Crawley, S Curran, B Duckett, L Livingstone, O Pope, M Potts, A Rashid, J Tongue, C Woakes.\n\nOne-year deals:\n\nM Ali, J Anderson, B Foakes, J Leach, D Malan, O Robinson, B Stokes, R Topley.\n\nDevelopment deals:\n\nM Fisher, S Mahmood, J Turner."

        "body": "For many in the Dallas area, Thursday’s Major League Cricket opening night will be their introduction to the sport.\n\nIf you are in that number, The Dallas Morning News has you covered.\n\nCricket has been a global staple for almost 200 years in the sports world. The first international sporting event of any kind was a cricket match between the United States and Canada in 1844. Today, the sport still draws hundreds of millions of viewers from across the globe. India, Pakistan, England and Australia are just a few of the countries that drive that viewership, and India is set to host the upcoming 2023 Cricket World Cup.\n\nRelated:UT-Dallas student Ali Sheikh highlights the rise of cricket in Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nWith America’s early British influence, cricket was once the most popular bat-and-ball sport in the U.S. before eventually getting beaten out by baseball.\n\nWith that historical context, here are a few things to know when watching cricket for the first time.\n\nMajor League Cricket\n\nThis summer is Major League Cricket’s inaugural season, and most of the games will take place at Grand Prairie Stadium. The league includes six teams – the Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom. Even though the teams are attached to different regions, they will all play matches in either Grand Prairie or Morrisville, N.C.\n\nEach team is backed by a bigger cricket entity that runs teams in T20 leagues around the world, many of which in the ultra-popular Indian Premier League.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Rider- Knight Riders Group\n\nMI New York- Mumbai Indians\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns- Cricket Victoria\n\nSeattle Orcas- GMR Group\n\nTexas Super Kings- Chennai Super Kings\n\nWashington Freedom- Cricket New South Wales\n\nThe matches will be played in the T20 format, meaning they will last around three hours and be limited to 20 overs per innings (more on that later).\n\nMany high-profile international players and investors will take part in the inaugural Major League Cricket season. Each team is allowed up to nine international players, and no more than six are allowed on the field at a time.\n\nRelated:‘Cricket City, USA:’ Grand Prairie is home to a new sports league with deep ties for many\n\nThe basics\n\nCricket involves two teams of 11 playing each other on an oval-shaped field trying to score the most runs. Two batsmen stand in the center of the field, called the pitch, where one tries to hit the ball delivered by the bowler. On each end of the pitch is a wicket, a set of three stumps and two bails. Each batsman stands in front of the wickets and will exchange places if the ball is hit. Each exchange equals one run.\n\nIf the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the field, it’s worth four runs -- hit it over the boundary and it’s worth six.\n\nThe other team tries to get them out by knocking the bail off the stump of the wicket with the ball before the batsmen complete an exchange.\n\nThe fielding team can also get a batsman out by catching a hit ball in the air or if the bowler hits the wicket, knocking the bails off the stumps. A batsman can choose not to swing or swing and miss at the ball, but is only out if the ball knocks the bails off the stumps of the wicket.\n\nTo put it in basic terms, the most excitement and cheers come when the ball is hit far, similar to baseball.\n\nFormats\n\nThere are a few different forms of cricket but they all fall under two categories, First-Class Cricket and Limited Overs Cricket. The difference is in the name.\n\nFirst-Class Cricket is the original form of the sport, and takes multiple days due to there being no overs limit. Each team has two innings in First-Class Cricket and bats until the entire team has recorded an out in each innings.\n\nThe two most common forms of Limited Overs Cricket are One-Day International and T20 Cricket. The difference between the two is how many overs there are. One-Day International, which is played in international cricket, has 50 overs, while T20 has 20 overs.\n\nT20 is the form Major League Cricket will play and is the format played by most professional leagues.\n\nEach form features a single inning per team, and the inning is complete when either 10 of the 11 batters are out or the set number of overs has been reached. One-Day International matches usually last around nine hours and T20 matches usually last around three.\n\nScorekeeping\n\nThe weeds of scorekeeping can get confusing, but the most important thing to know is that whoever scores more runs wins. When looking at a scoreboard, though, you may see numbers indicating the wickets and overs.\n\nHow exactly the scoreboard reads depends on which form of cricket is being played, but for T20 cricket, the runs, overs and wickets are what you’ll want to pay attention to. A scoreboard will often display the batting team’s runs next to their wickets in the innings. Then it will display how many overs and deliveries there have been in the innings and the opposing team’s score which may be labeled as the target.\n\nOvers\n\nA bowler can only bowl six deliveries at a time, which is called an over. After a bowler completes an over, the fielding team must switch bowlers. A player can bowl multiple times in an innings, but can’t bowl consecutive overs.\n\nThink of overs as at-bats, except the change from player to player between each over happens with the bowlers, not the batsmen. The batsmen do not change until they get out.\n\nOuts\n\nThere are several ways a batter or runner can get out, and they can be mostly categorized in two categories: a batsman can be caught out or the fielding team can knock the bail off the stumps of the wicket.\n\nWhile being caught out only comes from a ball being caught in the air, there are a few ways a team can get a batsman out by knocking the bails off the stumps of the wicket.\n\nHere are the most common ways an out can be recorded.\n\nThe fielding team can knock the bails off the stumps before the batsman reaches the crease that defines where they are safe (the bat is considered part of the body).\n\nA batsman can be bowled out, which is where the bowler delivers the ball past the batter and knocks the bails off the stumps.\n\nA batsman can be stumped out if they move past the line in front of the wicket called the popping crease and the wicketkeeper (think of this as the catcher) gains possession of the ball and knocks the bails off the stumps.\n\nA batsman can be called out if they allow the ball to hit them, and the umpire determines that the ball would’ve knocked the bails off the stumps. This is called a “leg before wicket.”\n\nThe fielding team must appeal to the umpire if they believe they got a batsman out who will confirm the out. If one of these occurrences happens and no one notices, the out won’t be called."

The league is likely to begin in July and will have six teams named after US cities. The tournament will be a single entity.\n\nDirector of Reliance Industries, Nita. M.

According to a recent story that Mint wrote, Indian viewers are heavily skewed towards watching only the Indian Premier League and Legends League Cricket only. As per viewership data sourced from Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) subscribers, the opening match of the last Legends League Cricket (LLC)—a T20 cricket tournament featuring recently retired cricketers—recorded a TV rating or TVR of 0.51—the percentage of the audience which saw the entire match. It considered the current TV universe size of 800 million across 210 million addressable TV homes.\n\nIn comparison, Big Bash League, Pakistan Super League and SAT20 opening matches recorded a TVR of 0.05 each. Caribbean Premier League was at 0.01, while Lanka Premier League could get 0.04 TVR for the opening match.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Others at Lions level are also understood to have been sounded out about joining the global Twenty20 circuit’s newest venture, which is fuelled by Indian Premier League investment and is set to become more lucrative in future years.\n\nRoy’s two-year contract with Los Angeles Knight Riders is worth £300,000, highlighting why he was willing to sacrifice a third of his £58,000 incremental deal to sign up. Until last October, Roy held a full central contract but for players in their 30s, neither centrally-contracted nor automatic picks in England’s white-ball teams, the mushrooming of global T20 tournaments has presented a dilemma.\n\nDavid Willey, Alex Hales and Sam Billings all opted to play for franchises rather than go on international tours last summer, due to the stark difference in remuneration, and now players a level below are facing the same kinds of decisions.\n\nThroughout this 2023 county season, informal approaches have been made to players by companies who operate teams in different markets, sounding them out for multi-tournament deals.\n\nOne of the only problems delaying those kind of moves is that the franchise world does not yet have a suitable mechanism.\n\nAs nearly all major T20 leagues feature player auctions or drafts, an organisation would either have to agree a combined salary and top-up to that amount in the event of the individual purchases tallying less, or settling for an agreed price plus all auction and draft sums."

        "body": "At the business end of its first-ever season, United States’ first ever professional T20 league – sanctioned by USA Cricket – has left impressive first footmarks. More than half the games across the two host cities of Dallas and Morrisville in the lead up to the final have been in front of sold out crowds. The star cast has featured the who’s who of T20 cricket in Rashid Khan, Mitchell Marsh, Quinton de Kock, Wanindu Hasaranga, Haris Rauf and more. The broadcast has aired across the country on CBS Sports, home of UEFA Champions League and the two big national love interests in National Football League (NFL) and National Basketball League (NBA). This, with an initial investment pot of over $120 million with investors that included Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella – Silicon Valley, check. And not to forget, the Minor League Cricket (MiLC), which was launched in 2021 as a developmental league to the MLC with 26 teams of its own and a budget upwards of $5 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The timelines work pretty well,” Dunmore believes, with a T20 World Cup being co-hosted next summer and cricket set to be introduced to the Olympics in Los Angeles five years down the line.\n\nBut hang on, cricket in the USA? It makes sense according to the marketing guy. “I do think if you know baseball, which most Americans obviously do, you really love a bat-ball sport with a lot of the same fundamentals as cricket,” Dunmore says. “If you go to Brazil or Italy, where there isn’t a big bat and ball sport, it’s going to be harder. At least here, we can translate that a six is a home run. You’re caught out when the ball’s in the air, things like that. They take some explaining. Some terminology of cricket can be a bit arcane. Why is a wicket three different things, for example. But once you get past that, I think the Americans can adopt the game pretty quickly.”\n\nThe first impressions have been ‘pleasantly’ surprising. “They’re actually surprised at how much action there is up against what they actually thought of the sport. The ball is in play a lot more in cricket. There’s a lot more big hitting, a lot more scoring, a lot more home runs/sixes.”\n\nIt isn’t the first time that the USA has looked outside of its fantastic four – Baseball, Basketball, American Football, Hockey – to adopt a more internationally followed sport. Not the first time Dunmore has been involved in doing so as well, having worked behind the scenes in America’s soccer revolution. With Major League Soccer (MLS) well into its 28th season, it was about time for ‘world’s second most popular sport’, as it has been introduced to the uninitiated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCricket though, is no soccer. “It’s a tough sport, right? It’s not like soccer where you can just pop it up on any rectangular field essentially, and play. Cricket takes a lot more work to get right and do it at a high level,” Dunmore states.\n\n“I’ve got a history of helping grow sports or introduce sports in the US,” Dunmore tells with a chuckle, before sharing a past that connects both him and America to cricket. “I grew up a cricket fan in England. Got connected to it more when I lived in Indianapolis, which had a cricket pitch built several years ago. There were some high ambitions for em’, even the ICC hosted some events there. Indianapolis had a really good vision for it. Didn’t quite pan out in the end but I got connected to some of the cricket folks in the US at that point. And then, got the chance to help launch this (MLC).”\n\nWho’s playing and watching it in the States?\n\n“The feeling has been like playing cricket in India,” says LA Knight Riders’ Jaskaran Malhotra of his on-ground MLC experience. The Chandigarh-born USA cricketer, the first to hit six sixes in an over for the national side, isn’t far-fetched in his assessment. The two venues in the league have witnessed the local South East Asian diaspora take to the stands in large numbers. From Afghani flags to Sri Lanka and India jerseys. “Pakistani players don’t feature in the IPL but here we have them. The likes of Shadab (Khan) and Haris (Rauf)….the standard of cricket has been very high,” Malhotra adds.\n\nThere is then, the question of how the other ethnicities in the country are responding to the sport, if at all? “In my academy in Baltimore, Maryland, there are a lot of local people who are taking up the sport. White, native and African Americans,” says the USA cricketer. “My entire extended family is based out of here. They are getting warmed up to the sport. People who have stayed in America for five generations are now enjoying it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to ignite a fan culture, the MLC Vice President of Marketing takes to the white board, “We already have millions of cricket fans here, which is a really great base to start with. There’s a whole generation of expats from cricket loving countries, who are exposed to the sport but aren’t going to be fans of the US team unless we give them something to cheer for. And that’s the chance that we have for the first time. If you’re a fan growing up in Dallas, you can support your hometown team now in cricket. That’s not been the case before. If we can win that generation over as well as the immigrants that are already here….then it’s about converting kids that didn’t grow up with cricket. That will take a bit of trial and error but we want to solely increase the percentage of fans that didn’t grow up with cricket.”\n\nFor former England World Cup-winning pacer Liam Plunkett as well, cricket in the USA has been a familiar experience. “It has felt like a proper cricket tournament with packed crowds supporting all the sides involved,” he tells. The pacer’s LinkedIn bio speaks for itself: Starting a new adventure in the USA. Playing at Surrey Cricket Club during the fag end of his career, Plunkett was reached out by the MLC not just to play but “structure the national development coach role. Look after the players and help run the Philadelphia academy.”\n\nDoes he picture MLC making it to the big league status; like IPL is to cricket or NFL is to the USA? “I mean, that’s huge in America, isn’t it? NFL is like cricket in India. A religion to a lot of Americans. IPL is a different ball game altogether. If we can even climb the ladder towards that it would be amazing. But it would take a lot of time.”\n\nWith a World Cup and a first cricket featuring Olympics on the horizon, the land of opportunity has another."

        "body": "Today we will discuss the salary of a Major League Cricket player in the USA.\n\nWhen it comes to professional sports in America, we often think of baseball, basketball, and football as the top dogs.\n\nBut there’s a new player in town that’s been gaining international attention: Cricket. Major League Cricket has been making waves in the sports world, especially with the growing popularity of T20 cricket. However, there’s one question on every cricket fan’s mind: just how much do these players make?\n\nMLC Cricketer Salary – By the Numbers\n\nThe average salary of a Major League Cricket player (MLC) is $60,526 (maximum 19 players in squad with a purse of $1.15 million).\n\nThe average salary for a domestic Major League cricketer is $39,375 ($315,000 purse for a total of 8 domestic players). The average salary for an overseas MLC cricketer is $92,200 ($830,000 for nine overseas slots).\n\nAbout $320,000 from the $1.15 million will be spent on the ten domestic players. Hence, $830,000 is remaining in the purse of each team to sign the nine overseas players. Note, that this amount may be skewed. According to a Daily Mail report, Jason Roy has been offered 300,000 pounds ($372,000) on a 2-year contract ($186,000/year). This means that LA Knight Riders, who signed Jason Roy, will be left with about $644,000 for their remaining 8 overseas signing (for an average of $80,500 per overseas player).\n\nCompared to other leagues, MLC ranks at #7 in the richest cricket leagues (according to average salaries).\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) – How Much Was Each Draft Pick?\n\nThe Major League Cricket (MLC) draft was held earlier this year in the NASA Space Center in Houston.\n\nThe draft picks ranged from $10,000 (8th round pick) to $75,000 (1st round pick).

While it may not match the salary of some of the top athletes in America, it is impressive for a sport that’s still finding its footing in the country.\n\nAs a fan of the sport, it’s exciting to see the potential for growth and success in Major League Cricket, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for these talented athletes. With cricket’s popularity on the rise, it’s not a stretch to say that the league’s players could one day be just as well-compensated as their counterparts in football and baseball.\n\nSources: MLC 2023 Domestic Player Draft Recap – Major League Cricket, Harmeet Singh goes first in MLC Draft to Seattle Orcas Ali Khan and Unmukt Chand snapped by LA Knight Riders\n\nRelated Cricket Content\n\nMajor League Cricket Articles\n\nIf you are interested in more articles on USA Cricket and Major League Cricket, check out the following:\n\n56 American Cricketers Who Left Their Countries and Moved to Play Cricket in the USA: List of USA Cricketers Who Were Born in Other Nations\n\n11 Overseas Cricketers in Major League Cricket (MLC) in USA: Aaron Finch, Quinton de Kock…Can You Guess the Rest?\n\nHow Many Cricket Stadiums are there in the USA?\n\nMajor League Cricket Schedule, Fixtures, Venues: Where to Buy Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023 Tickets?\n\nUSA Cricket—The Complete Guide to Cricket in America (Updated 2023)\n\nAvinash’s Cricket Journey in the USA: an Interview\n\nCricket and Finances Articles\n\nFor other content on Finances in Cricket, do read:\n\nTop 12 Richest Cricket Boards (RANKED 2023): Which Cricket Board Has the Highest Net Worth?\n\nTop 11 Richest Cricket Leagues (By Average Salaries).

        "body": "Major League Cricket wrapped up its inaugural season yesterday at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas, and \"with an initial outlay of $120M and much infrastructure to build,\" investors know this is \"not a get-rich-quick scheme,\" according to Tom Dart of the London GUARDIAN. MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan said, \"We have a very clear path to where we think the league and the teams are going to be break-even and then profitable from then on ... in a very realistic timeframe. We are not talking 10 years or anything like that. We would like to see that happen in the three-to-five-year horizon.\" Dart noted Texas has a large South Asian population, with \"about half of the state’s 450,000 Indian Americans living in the Dallas area.\" Texas Super Kings co-owner Anurag Jain said, \"There is a good springboard of Indian, South Asian and Commonwealth diaspora that are here. Eventually we’ll explore other markets just like soccer did in the US 30 years ago.\" As for the players, Washington Freedom owner Sanjay Govil said that overseas players are \"enticed by the opportunity to spend a few weeks in the US -- and by salaries that are on a par with high-grade T20 leagues around the world.\" But the league knows that U.S. growth is the true goal. Jain: \"Whatever we do, whoever the owners are, ultimately this is an American league, it’s an American product.\" Jain also pointed out that matches were \"timed to appeal to US prime-time viewers.\" Srinivasan: \"Our line-ups, all of them have a strong US domestic component, so this is a platform for growing American cricket in all respects. This is not meant to be anything other than that\" (London GUARDIAN, 7/30).\n\nONLY THE BEGINNING: The Seattle Orcas ownership group said this first MLC season has \"been a commercial success.\" Over two-thirds of the matches “have been sold out,” and the demand for playoffs tickets “exceeded stadium capacity.” CBS “even started broadcasting some games.” However, the Orcas ownership group said that for the game to see “long-term success” in the U.S., \"building a pipeline from youth to adulthood is crucial.” Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar said that with a “large number of immigrants in the Seattle area from cricket-loving countries like India, Pakistan and New Zealand,\" there is an “appetite for the sport regionally.” Somasegar said that Grand Prairie Stadium was a \"proof of concept,” but the Orcas are “working to build a 20-acre cricket venue in Marymoor Park in Redmond that would hold up to 6,000 people.” He added that the “hope is to have the stadium ready for the 2025 season” (PUGET SOUND BUSINESS JOURNAL, 7/31)."

        "date": "Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Some of cricket's biggest stars will return for the second edition of Major League Cricket as America's well-heeled T20 franchise league aims to build on a successful debut season.\n\nThe international player retention window recently concluded with the six franchises unveiling their star returnees for the second edition starting in July. The inaugural champion MI New York will have seven players starring, including captain Keiron Pollard and Nicholas Pooran - the hero in last season's final.\n\nAustralian emerging star Spencer Johnson, who has a million-dollar contract at the money-spinning Indian Premier League, will return for Los Angeles Knight Riders in a boost for a team that finished last season in last spot.\n\nTexas Super Kings bring back captain Faf du Plessis, while Washington Freedom - who recently unveiled Australian legend Ricky Ponting as coach - and San Francisco Unicorns have also made key retentions with Akeal Hossain and Haris Rauf returning for their teams respectively.\n\nSeattle Orcas, aiming to go one better after being runners up in 2023, have brought back South African stars Quinton De Kock and Heinrich Klassen.\n\nNot only is it important for stars to return to MLC, a vindication on what it achieved in its first season, but also the retention means franchises can start building a brand around an identifiable core of players.\n\nA domestic player draft will be held next month as teams build out their rosters for the much-anticipated season. MLC was a resounding success in its debut season after finally launching four years after the competition had been originally announced.\n\nMatches in the 18-day tournament in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina, were marked by heaving crowds mostly filled with expat South Asians excitedly lured to watch a sport that is treated as something close to a region in the subcontinent.\n\nBut there were a sprinkling of local fans who were intrigued about watching a game that has long baffled those not from British Commonwealth countries. While it was a relief that the tournament started strongly, recording $8 million in revenue as I first reported last year, the pressure is on for MLC to back up that success.\n\n\"We were just holding our breath on this tournament,\" San Francisco co-owner Anand Rajaraman told me after last season. \"We got this tournament to where we thought we would get to in the second or third year.\n\n\"There was a novelty factor in the first season, which won't be there in the second season. We have to consciously build on what we've started.\"\n\nDetails of the new season will be announced soon with organizers saying that the tournament will start on July 4 and finish by early August. That means the second edition of the MLC is set to be longer with owners hoping for a home and away format, where teams play each other twice, to eventually underpin the competition.\n\nFor the tournament, and cricket, to gain a foothold in communities, all the franchises will need their own stadiums, but that still appears a few years off.\n\nThe second edition of MLC, which has more than $100 million invested and can financially compete with many of the other high-profile T20 franchise leagues, is likely to be a gradual build.\n\nBut the momentum should help continue to change cricket's maligned perception in a country where the sport has struggled for relevancy and been riddled with internal turmoil.\n\nAfter cautionary tales, most notably in 2004 when an eight-team T20 professional league called Pro Cricket folded after just one season, cricket has started to make genuine inroads into the world's biggest sports market.\n\nBefore MLC's second season gets underway, U.S. will stage a cricket World Cup for the first time with June's T20 tournament set to be an era-defining event."

Dill was absolutely pumped up, he got the last laugh after being plonked for a six. 116 / 4\n\n6.1 to N Pooran , Plays down the wrong line and makes a mess of his stumps! What have you done Pooran? No Pollard in this game and this is a massive massive breakthrough! Netravalkar is right on money, pitched up and gets some movement as well, he has a big mow at it but didn't pick the line, middle stump is flattened and he has to take the long walk back into the pavilion. Lost his balance as he tried to pump it over midwicket. 24 / 2\n\n19.6 to Rashid Khan , Ball thunders into the front pad elicits a appeal and up goes the finger, thumps him low on the pad beating his sweep and that's a pretty straightforward decision for the umpire. 141 / 7\n\n9.2 to Shayan Jahangir , Once again inverses stance and tries to play fine but fails to connect as Akeal vociferously appeals for an lbw and the umpire eventually raises the dreaded finger. Jahangir decides to send it upstairs. No spike on the snicko as the ball passes the bat. Oh, that is stone dead! Three reds on the screen and Jahangir bites the dust after a scratchy 25, just when his team wanted him to tee off and accelerate, he has lost his wicket. 41 / 3\n\n2.2 to MW Short , Whoa! What a tremendous riposte from thunderBoult! Pulls his length back slightly, a cutter that befuddles him completely, goes for the big mow across the line and ends up dragging it back onto his stumps. Huge scalp! Just what the doctor ordered for MI. 14 / 1\n\n14.3 to GD Phillips , On a length and veers back in from round the wicket, he miscues a skier to long-off who gobbles it up down his throat. Slow ball outfoxes him completely and he was into his a shot a bit too early and Wiese in the deep is safe as a house, his bucket hands sends Glenn packing. 86 / 6\n\n18.1 to AJ Hosein , That's a screamer! Back of a length, angled into the body, he takes a step to the on side and then launches the ball straight into the hands of Wiese at long-on. He charged in pocketed the catch low down. A very timely scalp for MI New York after the big last over. 117 / 7\n\n18.3 to M Jansen , Wiese has taken another blinder! Stunning effort. Looking to go over extra cover for six but doesn't connect well, miscues the skier and once again Wiese was charging in from long-off and dived forward to hang on to it. What a snare, absolute ripper! Bat turned in his hand and it came off the splice, soaring high up in the air but didn't get the distance.. 118 / 8\n\n7.5 to AGS Gous , Round the wicket, length ball on middle, plinked to long-off! A misjudgment from Gous and Freedom have a big wicket. He coaxed him into going for this lofted drive and it was a regulation catch for Tim David - smoothly done. Another momentum-breaker but MI need to find wickets at regular intervals.. 48 / 2\n\n11.6 to AJ Pienaar , Tries to work this through square leg and gets beaten, massive appeal and he is adjudged lbw. Sent upstairs. Tossed up on a length and its straightening on middle and leg, nothing on the snicko, pitching outside off, impact in line and crashing right onto the leg stump so the on-field decision stands. MI are now in the driving seat thanks to Kenjige who first got Mukhtar run out and now traps Pienaar lbw - rising up to the occasion and doing a fantastic job for his skipper! The required run rate is getting out of hand and wickets are tumbling! Problems for Freedom. 72 / 5"

        "body": "Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has said that Major League Cricket could negatively affect the popularity of T20 Blast. Maxwell played for Birmingham Bears in this year's T20 Blast.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio, Maxwell said T20 Blast could be affected negatively with the advent of the popular MLC. In the previous T20 Blast season, Maxwell scored 248 runs from 14 matches at an average of 17.71, while striking at 153.08.\n\n“I think now the Major League Cricket tournament's come in, that's going to affect the Blast really badly. When you've got an opportunity to go over to America for two weeks, compared to 14 games here with a stressful schedule where you're travelling all over the place,” said Maxwell.\n\nHe went on to say that the fixture list of T20 Blast is packed which can really drain the players physically and mentally. MLC kick-started on July 14 with Texas Super Kings defeating LA Knight Riders in the opening match.\n\n“There was one week where we played on a Tuesday in Durham, Thursday in Leeds and then Friday here in Birmingham - that's three games in four days with a day's travel in between. It can really drain you, your body and mentally,” Maxwell added.\n\nThe Australian said Major League Cricket looks more attractive and can pull bigger crowds, while having a shorter schedule.\n\n“I found that very tough this year and I think with the Major League being a lot more attractive, bigger crowds, I think there's eight [six] overseas players per team, the excitement of a new tournament, it's only two weeks long. Less of a burden on your schedule. I think it's going a lot more attractive to some overseas players,” said Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell is not part of the Australian Test side which is currently facing England in the five-match Ashes 2023 series, with the fourth match of the series set to be played at Old Trafford in Manchester."

        "body": "When my father got a job teaching in the United States, we left India behind, and cricket along with it. When I was completing my high school education in Alabama, and going to college at Auburn University, I could no longer watch the matches being played back in India, and there was no easy way to follow the ups and downs of the season. On the odd occasion, we would gather together a group of fans–usually South Asian and British expats–and take over a local baseball field to play some pickup cricket. But for the most part, we had no way to stay connected to cricket. It’s the world’s second most popular sport–but in the United States, it was still unknown.\n\nIn the time since then, the sports world has undergone many changes. The professionalization of the business of sports has transformed sports leagues and teams. They are now complex businesses with multiple revenue streams, from live entertainment and intellectual property to hospitality, catering, fashion, and real estate. More and more teams are part of a diversified portfolio of assets, with media rights, technology, IP, real estate holdings, and large operating teams focused on optimizing profitability.\n\nThe relentless pursuit of financial optimization has brought with it a range of new ways for fans to view and connect with the teams they love. Along with advances in technology, this new approach has opened up avenues like streaming, betting, and fantasy, providing paths for fans to engage with their favorite sports and players on a local and global level. Today, an Indian-American family living in Alabama can stream highlights and full matches being played by the best Indian cricket teams, no matter where they are competing.\n\nYet even as these changes have broadened access for casual and devoted fans alike, taken to their extreme, they risk eroding the passion that drives the unique relationship between teams and fans. When fans are seen as customers, rather than passionate supporters, we lose some of the purity of sport. And when teams are managed like high-performing financial assets, the fan experience becomes similar across teams and leagues, eliminating some of the quirks and idiosyncrasies that used to make fandoms across regions unique. With a more professionalized experience comes a sense of distance; even with more opportunities for access, fans are held at a certain remove.\n\nThat’s why, when the opportunity arose to launch a new professional cricket league in the United States, I jumped at the chance. Here was an opportunity to share a sport that I loved with others who love it–to provide the kind of personal experience that increasingly is missing from other professional sports. Out of this idea came Major League Cricket­–a new franchise league in the United States. Currently comprising six teams, with squads from Texas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle joining the Washington Freedom (the team I own, based in Washington, DC), the league’s 2023 season will feature 19 matches played over 18 days, building up to the first-ever MLC championship final on Jul. 30, 2023. As many teams have a connection to franchises in the India Premier League, we have structured the season so that matches will take place during Indian cricket’s regular off-season. What’s more, we can offer streaming opportunities that provide additional access to fans without cheapening their experience.\n\nOne of the elements that make this new venture unique is the owners. From Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan to Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, the owners have the same kind of connection to the sport that I do–one built on a history of true fandom and a desire to share their excitement with others.\n\nThere is no doubt that our sport will grow and change as time goes on. Make no mistake, I and others who have invested in this new league see an opportunity to grow cricket in the United States both as a passion project and as a business. But we are determined never to lose the purity and the fandom of sports–and to safeguard the experience that is so important to us all.\n\nSanjay Govil is the chairman of the board at Infinite Computer Solutions and owner of the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune."

The 26 team franchise affair is touted to be a semi professional league underpinning the MLC, a developmental league on the lines of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. The tournament, spanning over 2 months, will see over 150 T20 games being played over 15 states in the US.\n\nThere have been major overhauls in the makeup of the squads that took the field last year. Defending champions, Seattle Thunderbolts have been severely impacted by the spate of departures as captain Harmeet Singh, Andries Gous, Shubham Ranjane and Phani Simhadri move down to the Central and Southern Conference teams.\n\nIn a surprise move, Silicon Valley Strikers parted ways with captain Unmukt Chand who's been the most prolific batter of the league over two seasons apart from having the Strikers lift the silverware in the inaugural season. Former Pakistan and MI New York allrounder, Hammad Azam will now be at Dallas Mustangs. Azam was named the MVP of the inaugural season before an injury laden second season mostly saw him out of action for Golden State Grizzlies. A slew of PSL cricketers will call quits to Pakistan cricket after qualifying as local cricketers in the MiLC including the likes of former Pakistan U19 captain Hassan Khan, Imran Khan Jnr. and Zia ul Haq.\n\nThe league will also see USA national players in action as they strive to remain relevant in the wake of cricketers like Corey Anderson, Harmeet Singh, Smit Patel and Shadley Van Schalkwyk qualifying for the national team after serving their cool off period. Skipper Monank Patel will make his way across the Hudson to play for the New Jersey Stallion after appearing for the Empire State Titans last year. Steven Taylor is set to miss the season owing to his CPL commitments with the Jamaica Tallawahs.\n\n\"The recent success of Major League Cricket shows the strong appetite for cricket in America and the long-term plan to build American cricket is dependent on a successful pipeline of talent coming through Minor League Cricket,\" said Zubin Surkari, Tournament Director, Minor League Cricket. \"The third season of MiLC will allow fans to see many players who featured in MLC up close while giving the next generation of American cricket stars the chance to shine.\"\n\nThe 26 teams are divided into Atlantic and Pacific Conferences. The Atlantic conference is further segregated into eastern and southern divisions while the Pacific conference is further bifurcated into western and central divisions. The league stage and playoff rounds will culminate in a finals week at the Grand Prairie Stadium, the site of the MLC final, on October 6-7.\n\n© Cricbuzz"

He complained about the excessive travel and less time between matches in the Blast.\n\nMaxwell played for Birmingham Bears in this year's Blast, which was a nine-team tournament and involved at least 14 matches for each side. The Aussie, however, pulled out of The Hundred to manage his workload.\n\nMeanwhile, the MLC is a six-team tournament, where each side plays the others once in the group stage followed by the playoffs.\n\n\"I think now the Major League Cricket tournament's come in, that's going to affect the Blast really badly,\" Maxwell said on BCC radio. \"When you've got an opportunity to go over to America for two weeks, compared to 14 games here with a stressful schedule where you're travelling all over the place. There was one week where we played on a Tuesday in Durham, Thursday in Leeds and then Friday here in Birmingham - that's three games in four days with a day's travel in between.\"\n\n\"It can really drain you, your body and mentally,\" Maxwell added. \"I found that very tough this year and I think with the Major League being a lot more attractive, bigger crowds, I think there's eight [six] overseas players per team, the excitement of a new tournament, it's only two weeks long. Less of a burden on your schedule. I think it's going a lot more attractive to some overseas players.\"\n\nMaxwell didn't have the best of T20 Blast seasons with the Bears, scoring 248 runs from 14 matches at an average of 17.71, striking at 153.08.\n\nWhere is Glenn Maxwell currently?\n\nGlenn Maxwell is playing in the County Championship in England for Warwickshire.\n\nIn his first match of the season, he scored a 67-ball 81, hitting 10 fours and two sixes. The knock, which came soon after Australia's loss in the third Ashes Test, sparked interest in him having an outside chance to be in the Aussie team.\n\nThe fourth Ashes Test of the five-match series will be played between July 19-23 in Manchester."

        "body": "ECB to block centrally contracted England players from inaugural MLC\n\nGEORGE DOBELL: No Objection Certificates will not be granted for the competition, which is staged during the Ashes in July. The involvement of county stars is currently unclear with the PCA pushing for players to be released\n\nThe ECB look set to decline to release centrally contracted players to appear in Major League Cricket.\n\nThe competition, the first major franchise cricket league to be launched in America, is scheduled to be played for three weeks from July 13 when England's men are involved in the Ashes.\n\nWhile England's specialist limited-overs players are not scheduled to be in action during that time (apart from Vitality Blast Finals Day at Edgbaston on July 15), The Cricketer understands they have been informed that NOCs (No Objection Certificates) will not be granted. Without such certificates, players cannot sign for another league.\n\nThe involvement of county players is currently unclear, too.\n\nThe six-team Major League Cricket competition begins on July 13 (MLC)\n\nWhile the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) are pushing for players to be released with the same arrangements as used for the Indian and Caribbean Premier Leagues (where counties and players come to mutual agreements) there is some discomfort within the ECB at the prospect.\n\nThey are also resistant to encouraging the development of a competition which takes place in the prime weeks of the English summer.\n\nThe ECB are keen to have as many of their big-name players appearing in the men's Hundred, which starts on August 1, as possible and will also want them as fresh as possible for the 50-over World Cup which starts in October.\n\nAaron Finch and Quinton de Kock were among six marquee overseas names revealed at the inaugural MLC draft on Sunday (March 19). England World Cup winner Liam Plunkett, who left for the United States in 2021, is also scheduled to feature in the six-team competition.\n\nRelated Topics"

        "body": "Major League Cricket, the first T20 cricket competition in the United States, will begin Thursday, July 13 with the Texas Super Kings taking on the Los Angeles Knight Riders. Here’s everything you need to know about this competition.\n\nCricket in the United States? When did this happen?\n\nThis league has been in the works for quite some time, and will finally be taking place this summer. It is backed by the founders of Willow TV, the primary cricket broadcaster in North America, several prominent investors and the Times Group of India.\n\nDoes USA have a cricket team?\n\nInterestingly enough, the first ever international cricket match on record was played in the United States between America and Canada. Now, this was back in the 1800s and Americans likely saw cricket as a British game and gravitated more towards baseball. That doesn’t mean the game isn’t prominent across the country at a grassroots level.\n\nUSA does have an international team, and just played in the ODI World Cup qualifiers. They didn’t win a single match, but they will be more prominently featured in the 2024 T20 World Cup as a co-host with the West Indies.\n\nHow many teams are in Major League Cricket?\n\nThere are six teams in MLC this season. They are the Super Kings, Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians New York, Washington Freedom, Seattle Orcas and San Francisco Unicorns. If some of those names sound familiar, it’s because four of the six teams are owned by IPL franchise owners. Three of them have adopted the IPL team name in Texas, LA and New York.\n\nHow many games will be played this season?\n\nThere will be just 19 games in the tournament, which will run over two weeks. 15 games will be in the group stage. There will be an eliminator, two qualifiers and a final similar to the IPL playoffs.\n\nWho are some of the prominent players in MLC?\n\nThere won’t be any big-name Indian players due to BCCI regulations and the team currently being on tour, but MLC did a great job bagging other big names. Kieron Pollard, Faf du Plessis, Jason Roy, Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Aaron Finch and Quinton de Kock have all been prominent on the international cricket scene. Many of the fans attending these games will know those players.\n\nWhere are MLC games being played?\n\nThere are two venues for MLC games this season. Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas is the main venue and has the first eight group games, while Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina will have the next seven group games. The playoffs return to Grand Prairie Stadium. This is surely a trial run for the expansion of venues across the country, especially since there’s no North Carolina-based team.\n\nWill MLC games be available on TV and livestream?\n\nAll games will be broadcasted on Willow TV and available through willow.tv with a subscription login.\n\nWho is favored to win?"

        "title": "Silicon Valley investors expect cricket to finally crack America",
        "date": "Tue May 30 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Officially, it is called Major League Cricket; a more apt name, perhaps, would be the American IPL. Most of the owners are the same with four of the six sides having Indian Premier League owners.\n\nMajor League Cricket is a competition whose impact will be felt across the pond, as England have already learned with Jason Roy signing and Moeen Ali being approached too.\n\nPer-game, it is already among the five best-paying leagues in the world; the salary cap per side, £930,000, is only just below the Hundred’s £1m, even though Major League Cricket has one-third fewer games.\n\nOn July 13 in Grand Prairie, Texas, Major League Cricket will begin its first season. Professional cricket in the US has long existed more as International Cricket Council fantasy than reality. But, after a series of mooted leagues have collapsed at inception, this time is different. Over 40 international players have been lured to the US for the tournament – Quinton de Kock, Anrich Nortje and Roy have already been signed, with Trent Boult and Sunil Narine expected to be announced soon. About £100 million has already been pledged in spending for the league, with over half of this already invested.\n\nMuch of this has come from some of the most-prominent figures in Silicon Valley, including Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft who is an investor in Major League Cricket and also a co-owner of the Seattle Orcas.\n\n“He’s a cricket fan and passionate about it,” says Tom Dunmore, the vice president of marketing at Major League Cricket. “It’s a great fit to have him as an investor-partner.”\n\nNadella, who initially moved from India to the US to study computer science, embodies the importance of the South Asian diaspora for Major League Cricket. All six teams have either IPL owners or some ownership from businessmen born in India. The South Asian diaspora are also central to Major League Cricket’s belief that the competition will have a sizeable audience. The US now has 4.6 million people classed as Indian American, up from 1.9 million in 2000; two-thirds of these were born in India.\n\nThis group tend to be highly educated and, often, very wealthy too. The median household income of Indian-Americans is double the national average, making accessing the group hugely attractive for advertisers. If demographics are destiny, then demographics might now be on cricket’s side in the US. “That’s changed the sport really in the US over the last couple of decades – immigration from South Asia, and other places,” Dunmore says. “It’s built a much larger support for the game.”\n\nWhenever there is talk of cricket in the US, it tends to provoke guffaws at the notion of cricket usurping baseball as the nation’s summer outdoor game. But the size and wealth of the country is such that cricket does not need to usurp baseball as America’s bat-and-ball game of choice for the US to be a significant part of the sport’s global landscape. Indeed, even without Major League cricket, it already is a force with the US thought to be the fifth most lucrative broadcasting market for the International Cricket Council’s global events like the World Cup.\n\nThis year’s tournament will only run for 18 days, with the six teams playing all their matches in Dallas and another venue expected to be in North Carolina. All six teams are developing stadiums - generally with planned capacities around 10,000 - that will enable the competition to run a home-and-away format. This will entail the tournament expanding from 19 games to around 34; next summer is already planned to include more games than this year.\n\nUltimately, Major League hopes to develop beyond the existing six teams. “In the long run, there’s room for expansion,” Dunmore says. “There are great cities with massive cricket-loving populations that don’t have teams, but we want to do it carefully - build the league first.”\n\nConflict with the rest of the global calendar, already saturated, is inevitable. Being played in the northern hemisphere summer means that Major League Cricket’s competition is less fierce than for other new leagues; four major T20 leagues were played in tandem in January. While Major League Cricket hopes to minimise - or ideally completely avoid - a clash with the Hundred, an enlarged competition will heighten the difficulties for the T20 Blast in signing the best international players.\n\nYet, for all the focus on Major League Cricket, as important is what lies underneath. Most cricket ventures in North America like the India-Pakistan ODIs in Toronto in the 1990s, or the Cricket All-Stars matches between teams captained by Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne in 2015 – have focused on monetising the market that already exists.\n\nThrough Minor League Cricket, a development league with 26 teams that launched in 2021, Major League Cricket is trying to build the sport’s infrastructure in the US. It is an onerous challenge: governance in US cricket is so chaotic that one insider likens it to “the Wild West”. The country has a crippling shortage of reasonable quality facilities: there are only thought to be 10 turf wickets in the US. Under seven weeks out from the first ball in Major League Cricket, a home broadcaster has yet to be confirmed.\n\nAnd so, investors need to be sure of one thing: profits, if they come, will not be swift. While this is true of all new sports leagues - even the IPL took until 2018 for all franchises to reliably make money - the uncertainties are greater in the US. But so, perhaps, are the possibilities, especially with the US co-hosting the T20 World Cup next year and growing optimism that cricket will feature in the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 2028.\n\nIn many ways, there is an essential irony to the US’s attempts to mimic the IPL. Lalit Modi, the IPL co-founder, modelled the competition on US sports leagues. Just like US leagues, the IPL was set-up with a salary cap to ensure relative equality between teams and maintain competitive balance, and has no promotion and relegation - pleasing owners, who loathe the uncertainty. And, just like US leagues, the IPL was designed as a fusion of sport and entertainment. Essentially, the IPL marked the Americanification of Indian cricket. Now, the circle is almost complete: the US is trying to learn from the IPL."

Michael Klinger and Greg Shipperd, NSW's head of male cricket and head coach respectively, hold parallel roles with Freedom.\n\nSmith, who turned 34 last month, has regularly spent time in New York City and proposed to his wife Dani there in 2017. He has previously floated the possibility of playing in MLC, telling the Sydney Morning Herald that finishing his career in the USA \"would be pretty cool\".\n\nRelated\n\nSunil Narine pulls out of Finals Day with Surrey to focus on Major League Cricket\n\nSunil Narine's mission impossible: 75 hours, two continents, four games\n\nEverything you need to know about MLC Season 1\n\nMLC don't want to 'start a war with anyone'\n\n\"As a New South Wales boy, the partnership the Freedom has with my home state means a lot to me,\" Smith said in a promotional video. \"Cricket in Australia has a rich history and I look forward to being part of taking cricket to the United States of America.\"\n\nAustralia don't have any fixtures in their Future Tours Programme commitments during MLC's July window next year, with an away T20I series against Afghanistan at the end of August their first scheduled tour after the men's T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the USA in June 2024.\n\nSmith declined to comment on his long-term career plans at the start of Australia's ongoing tour of England, ahead of the World Test Championship final against India, but would be able to play in MLC while continuing to play for Australia as a centrally contracted all-format international.\n\n\"Steve has a close relationship with New South Wales and Sydney Sixers,\" Klinger told ESPNcricinfo. \"He obviously had five fantastic games in the last BBL, and to have him on board as an ambassador to promote the team is great. He's going to really lift the profile of the Washington Freedom.\n\n\"Some of his best mates, the New South Wales guys, are playing in the team, like [captain] Moises Henriques, and to be able to promote the Freedom with someone of Steve's stature is going to be great for us. We certainly hope it's a long-term relationship and we'll see how that goes down the track.\"\n\n\"We've got a few very strong New South Wales players who we'd certainly be interested in chatting to\"\n\nMichael Klinger\n\nHenriques, Ben Dwarshuis, Josh Philippe and Tanveer Sangha are the NSW players due to appear for Freedom in the inaugural season of MLC, which runs from July 13 to 30. A number of Australia's most high-profile players are products of the NSW system and Klinger hopes to convince some of them to appear in MLC's second season.\n\n\"We've got a few very strong New South Wales players who we'd certainly be interested in chatting to,\" Klinger said. \"Some of the fast bowlers often want to take breaks, especially straight after a World Cup, but in saying that, they'll be in the America and West Indies area, so hopefully they'll be keen to come and play for us.\n\n\"You've got [Mitchell] Starc, you've got [Pat] Cummins, you've got [Josh] Hazlewood. Sean Abbott is involved in that group now as well. We have some really good options next year plus our current high-profile overseas we've got this year - hopefully we can retain some of them as well.\n\n\"Especially coming off the back of the World Cup when they're already over here anyway, hopefully their schedule allows them to take seven to ten days off on holiday somewhere around this area and then they can join up and be involved next year.\"\n\nFreedom are due to play their first MLC fixture on Friday night, against Seattle Orcas in Dallas.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98"

Additionally, MLC has identified its upcoming facility at George Mason University in the Washington DC area as a potential venue for World Cup warm-up events.\n\nJustin Geale, Tournament Director at Major League Cricket, expressed enthusiasm for the upcoming season.\n\n“The tremendous success of the inaugural Major League Cricket season provides a perfect platform to propel American cricket to even greater heights in 2024,” Geale said.\n\nALSO READ: BCB Yet To Approve Bangladesh Players' Participation In IPL 2024\n\n“We expect to see even more world class players taking part in season two of Major League Cricket, creating an incredible summer for the sport in America along with the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” he added.\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC drew attention with big signings, featuring top-tier players who commanded impressive salaries, surpassing averages seen in leagues like the BBL and the SA20.\n\nThe world's top cricketers, along with the best domestic talent, played in 19 matches in the first season. MI New York won the first title by beating the Seattle Orcas in the final."

The sport is wildly popular in many places, but not in the United States.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings will host the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the opening match of a 19-match tournament at the newly transformed 7,200-seat Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas.\n\n\"It's a new beginning for cricket in this country,\" said Zubin Surkari, who is managing operations for Major League Cricket. \"T20 (a shorter format) is an exciting three hours of cricket, the pitch looks great, the field looks great. This has never been done in terms of a stadium of this magnitude.\"\n\nBig debut with big money\n\nMLC is a six-team competition that will be played from July 13-30 across two venues.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium in Texas will host the first eight games while the next seven matches will take place in Church Street Park in Morrisville, N.C., near Raleigh and Durham. The teams will then move back to Grand Prairie to participate in the playoffs.\n\nMI New York, the San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom are the remaining four teams, all featuring plenty of international cricket stars.\n\nMLC is a $120 million investment from multiple entities — mainly Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders of Willow TV, the largest broadcaster of cricket in North America.\n\nThe two businessmen plan to grow the game in the United States by bringing in international talent, and building stadiums and training facilities in hopes of cultivating the new generation of U.S. cricketers.\n\nCricket's future in the U.S. remains uncertain\n\nDespite being the world's second most-watched sport, behind soccer, cricket never managed to gain popularity in the U.S.\n\nSurkari said the new league's backers would like to change that and are marketing MLC to any American who likes bat-and-ball sport.\n\n\"The T20 format of cricket is very palatable to most people,\" Surkari said. \"Three hours of fun, getting ready for the stadium which has concession stands and lights and things for kids to do. It is like any other Minor League, Major League Baseball, but not just on that grand scale yet.\"\n\nHowever, Peter Della Penna, a former ESPN cricket writer, said the MLC has failed to cater to the sporting culture of the U.S. and has not done much to cultivate organic support from the general American public.\n\n\"A lot of the tickets have been given away as gifts to the families of the cricket players and organizers to fill in the stadium for the opening night,\" he said. \"There has been little to no effort made in terms of initiating grassroot level effort.\"\n\nPenna has been covering cricket in the U.S. for the past 18 years. He said that MLC's approach of developing cricket in the country is not different from that of USA Cricket (the men's and women's national cricket teams), as both have depended largely on migration patterns instead of building an organic pathway like other sports.\n\n\"There are a lot of people immigrating to participate in MLC but what does that say about the health and sustainability of the league and cricket more broadly in the country,\" Penna said. \"Instead of bringing in international stars that no Americans know about, cricket should rather be introduced as a high school league first which will create a pathway for it to be a NCAA Division 1 scholarship sport.\""

        "date": "Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Nestled in Raleigh-Durham’s Research Triangle, the national hub of science and technological research, thousands of transplanted cricket fans get the taste of home they’ve been missing. Adorned in the jerseys of their favorite Indian Premier League teams and carrying the flags of their home nations — 3,000 pack into the newly-constructed Morrisville Cricket Ground to see the final Major League Cricket (MLC) game in North Carolina, before the league heads back to Texas to close out the season.\n\nFrom knowledgeable die-hard fans, to those new to the game, young and old alike, there’s one prevailing sentiment sweeping the grounds: Cricket in the United States is going to work.\n\nMLC is finishing up its inaugural season, and Tuesday night saw the league-leading Seattle Orcas take on MI New York in an absolute nail-biting game which saw the Orcas pull out a win with four balls remaining in their innings, thanks largely to masterful batting from South African international Heinrich Klaasen, who finished the match with 110 runs, scoring the first century in league history in the process.\n\nThe result of this one game was far less important than what Tuesday night represented: Five games in Morrisville, five straight sellouts, matching the runaway success that MLC has had in Texas, where games have been selling out an even larger cricket ground in Grand Prairie (a suburb of Dallas) since the league began two weeks ago.\n\nThis season was designed as a proof of concept, and that concept has been proven. The appetite for cricket is alive, and the sky is the limit. Intentionally targeting markets with large South Asian populations, Major League Cricket has already won a cult following of Indian, Pakistani and Afghan fans — relishing the opportunity to see some of the best players from cricket’s past and present play in their new backyard.\n\nTuesday night also gave way to tremendous emotion, as Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan, now playing for MI New York was swarmed by fans at the fence while fielding. Predominantly teenagers and children, the majority of whom are refugees who found asylum in the United States. They had a rare chance to see a national sporting hero in their new home — and it clearly affected Khan, who did his best to continue playing while signing autographs for the legion of supporters chanting his name.\n\nMLC has managed to capture the party-like atmosphere of T20 cricket. The ground was a festival of color and sound, mashing together traditional cricket culture and a new environment. The PA system alternated between playing Indian pop songs and western Top-40 hits, whistles and horns droned through the crowd after ever big shot, and fans were encouraged to bring their own coolers of food and drink to fight back the heat. This league isn’t a cash grab, but a celebration of cricket and a love letter to the game.\n\nMajor League Cricket is already achieving something most sporting league dream of: Attracting young fans. At least 80 percent of those in attendance were 35-years-old or younger, with a majority of children and teenagers in attendance. Sure, one might chalk that up to being dragged to the game by their parents — but every fan in attendance was engaged, cheering, and excited to be a part of something that felt big, special, and on the verge of truly breaking out.\n\nArjun, a native of Mumbai now living in the Triangle, brought his wife and two young children to experience the game. “Cricket was a part of my childhood,” he says “now I want it to be a part of theirs.”\n\nThe next step is outreach and education. The league can certainly survive on a migrant population alone, but to thrive it will require transcending traditional cricket fans and capturing Americans who don’t know the game. To this end T20 is the perfect onboarding process, allowing games to last 3-4 hours, in a format which rewards big risks, huge hits, and plenty of excitement.\n\nThat’s no easy feat, but as the sport grows the FOMO of the next big thing in sports will set in. Especially as stadiums keep selling out and word of mouth travels about just how much fun cricket can be. Nobody left the grounds on Tuesday night thinking it was just “okay,” but rather even non-traditional fans seeing their first match raved about how incredible the experience was.\n\n“I was dragged here by my British coworker,” says Tyler, a software engineer from Raleigh. “I’ve heard of cricket before, but never seen it. This was incredible. Everyone would love this.” Tyler admits he didn’t always understand what he was watching, but he’s already hooked, “I’m definitely going to learn the rules and come back next year.”\n\nIt’s been over 20 years since I saw a cricket match in person. The 2002-03 Ashes 5th test between Australia and England was the final sporting event I saw back home before moving to the United States for college. Never in my wildest dreams did I think cricket would follow me to NC, but here I was, in 92-degree heat, with a smile plastered on my face for hours on end. I wasn’t the only one, because Morrisville has caught cricket fever — and it’s only going to spread.\n\nMajor League Cricket isn’t just here as a curiosity, it’s truly arrived."

Success! Top-notch talent flew in from across the globe to compete, and the hometown Texas Super Kings drew sellout crowds. If you were there, you likely saw what those of us at D did: this is a sporting experience different than anything we’re used to in these parts. A great one. (With pretty damn good stadium food, too!)\n\nThat isn’t to say obstacles don’t remain; I outlined many of them in my feature from our July issue. MLC will need to keep scaling up just as infrastructure on the grassroots level must become more robust. Five other cities must construct their own equivalent to Grand Prairie Stadium. It must convince one-off fans to become casuals, and casuals to become diehards. There is plenty of work to be done.\n\nBut that’s all in the future. For now, take one last look at the atmosphere that was in Sunday’s MLC Final, courtesy of photographer Bret Redman."

        "date": "Tue Apr 30 04:01:54 2024",
        "body": "Washington is one of six teams in Major League Cricket (MLC), which began in 2023. The Freedom finished third in the inaugural season, won by New York.\n\nThe 2024 season will begin in July before the US co-hosts the T20 World Cup with the West Indies.\n\nA number of established cricket stars have already played in the US league, including Quinton de Kock of South Africa, Nicholas Pooran from the West Indies, Trent Boult from New Zealand and Australians Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch.\n\nLooking ahead, T20 cricket has been included for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games. So, why is cricket suddenly interested in the US – and does this interest go both ways?\n\nCricket in the US: what's the go?\n\nCricket is slowly becoming better known in the US.\n\nFirstly, it is because of the rising South Asian population who mostly love their cricket. It is a growing and affluent professional community – the South Asian diaspora is growing at a rapid rate across North America to the point that when you fly into most large US cities, you can spot cricket pitches.\n\nMany South Asian immigrants to the US (and Canada) are engineers, doctors and entrepreneurs with good educations and professional jobs – Indian-Americans are the most affluent group in America by median household income, while Sri Lankans and Pakistanis are two of the eight wealthiest segments.\n\nIn terms of education, 70% of Indian-Americans have at least a Bachelor's degree, compared to the US average of 28%.\n\nA lot of this affluence is ploughed into supporting local cricket leagues in the US and watching the MLC.\n\nIn terms of participation, cricket is still very much a niche sport in the US, with about 200,000 registered players. However, this has grown from around 30,000 registered players in 2006, with emigration from South Asia driving the lion's share of growth.\n\nConsuming cricket anytime, anywhere\n\nSecondly, live streaming has taken off worldwide in recent years, allowing Indians in the US to watch India Premier League (IPL) games back home, and Indians in India to live stream MLC matches.\n\nAccording to Chris Muldoon, chief strategy officer of Cricket NSW, there are more than 4 million subscribers to Willow TV's cricket-only streaming service throughout North America.\n\nThis means it is easy for most cricket fans can consume what they want, when they want it.\n\nThe growth of cricket franchises\n\nThirdly, IPL franchises are launching clubs and leagues around the world – in South Africa, the UAE and the US – to grow the sport and to attract talent and revenue to their respective franchises.\n\nThere is a strong IPL presence across many of the domestic T20 competitions that have launched in recent years, including in MLS where four IPL franchises are involved with the foundation clubs in New York, Dallas, Los Angeles and Seattle.\n\nThis is a big shift in cricket governance, as it is not just the cricket boards of Australia, England & Wales and India calling the shots on schedules – it is now the IPL franchises too.\n\nWhat does this mean for Australian cricket?\n\nSo, how does all of this affect elite cricket in Australia?\n\nAustralian cricketers have been competing in T20 competitions around the world for years now, with Cricket Australia occasionally having to step in to reduce the workloads of some of its best players.\n\nNow the MLC will force governing bodies and players to react to another competition in a packed cricket calendar.\n\nAccording to Muldoon, the opportunity in the US is too big to ignore. He says:\n\n\"The US is the world's most sophisticated and competitive sports and media market and Major League Cricket presents the most exciting and challenging opportunity in world cricket.\n\n\"The proliferation of franchise T20 cricket around the globe, much of it driven by the commercial success of the IPL as well as changing preferences of consumers, is changing the way cricket is consumed. And it is bringing new revenue into the sport – which in turn is making it increasingly attractive to the world's best players and coaches to be a part of these growing franchise leagues around the world on an almost full-time basis.\""

        "body": "Major League Cricket wants to sign up England's best players for future editions but its founders have dismissed claims it is a threat to English cricket as \"short-sighted\".\n\nThe inaugural T20 franchise tournament in the United States starts on Thursday (Friday 01:30 BST) with two England World Cup winners - Liam Plunkett and Jason Roy - involved.\n\n\"American sports fans want to see the best in the world. That's the demand in US professional sports,\" MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport.\n\n\"They don't want second-tier talent. They insist on the best. England is fortunate to have some of those with the likes of Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow and Harry Brook.\"\n\nEngland opener Roy decided to cancel his incremental white-ball deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) - worth £60,000-£70,000 - to play in MLC, where he could potentially earn £150,000 for the tournament between 13-31 July.\n\nThe 32-year-old previously claimed his \"priority is England\" with a 50-over World Cup in October but a lucrative franchise T20 tournament, and one which runs parallel to the English summer, has been seen as a threat to the England team and county cricket.\n\nSrinivasan insisted that notion was \"a little bit short-sighted\" and MLC is \"not looking to step on anyone's toes\".\n\nHe added: \"We want the best in the world to come here and we want to do it in a way that makes sense for the player, makes sense for their national team obligations and so on.\n\n\"We need to find a window in the global cricket calendar that makes sense to get the best players.\n\n\"I think MLC is bringing a lot of mainstream attention to the sport in the US and that's going to help the global cricket ecosystem.\"\n\nThe US men's national team have not qualified for a major ICC tournament since the 2004 Champions Trophy but will participate in the 2024 T20 World Cup as co-hosts alongside West Indies.\n\nAs an associate ICC member, USA Cricket only receives a fraction of the budget full ICC members get, and Srinivasan believes the sizable investment in the sport's infrastructure by MLC will be a boost to cricket in the country and help drive the national team forward.\n\nThis year's MLC will be played at two grounds - in Texas and North Carolina - but owners of the six franchises are committed to building new stadiums, while the tournament itself will give exposure to a quota of homegrown players.\n\n\"One of the things we identified was that cricket in the US is not going to be successful unless the US has a strong cricket team,\" added Srinivasan.\n\n\"It's not about putting up a tournament, then coming back 12 months later and doing it again. There has to be something more.\n\n\"What we are doing is not building these stadiums to play MLC once a year. We want the US men's, women's and U19s teams to be playing in these venues where the best teams in the world come and play against them.\n\n\"On the back of it, the US needs a competitive national team. That's why when the ICC T20 World Cup comes to the US next year we want to make sure the US can compete with the rest of the world.\n\n\"The world of cricket is going through a big transition but for us, MLC is a platform for all things US cricket. We don't view it in isolation and a stand-alone thing that is detached. There's a lot more legs to the stool.\""

        "body": "The Seattle Orcas secured a classy victory in Major League Cricket after defeating MI New York by two wickets at Church Street Park, Morrisville on Tuesday.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen scored the first-ever century of the MLC as he played a magnificent unbeaten knock of 110 runs off 44 balls to guide the Orcas to victory in a high-scoring match.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas won the toss and elected to bowl first. MI New York had a shaky start to their innings, as opener Monank Patel (2) lost his wicket cheaply by the third over.\n\nGet Club Cricket SA news on Whatsapp\n\nShayan Jahangir (19) soon followed him back to the pavilion as he failed to build on his start. New York was struggling to put runs on the board as Hammad Azam (2) lost his wicket in the seventh over soon after MI had crossed the 50-run mark. Nicholas Pooran and Captain of MI New York, Kieron Pollard constructed a crucial partnership that steadied the ship for their team.\n\nNew York came back roaring back into the game thanks to Pooran (68), who lost his wicket in the thirteenth over after scoring a blistering half-century and guiding his team past 100 runs. Pollard (34) lost his wicket in the following over as the scores for MI New York read 132 runs for the loss of 5 wickets.\n\nA steady partnership between Tim David and David Wiese saw New York go past 150 runs. However, Tim David (18) failed to build on his solid start as he lost his wicket at the start of the eighteenth over. Rashid Khan (2) lost his wicket cheaply in the subsequent over soon after which Wiese (19) followed suit.\n\nNosthush Kenjige (3*) and Trent Boult (20*) scored 22 runs in the final over of their team’s innings that saw MI New York end their 20 overs with a total of 194 runs for the loss of eight wickets. Imad Wasim and Harmeet Singh picked up two wickets each for the Seattle Orcas, while Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye picked up a wicket each.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas had a decent start to the second innings, but Quinton de Kock (9) failed to build a fruitful partnership with Nauman Anwar as he lost his wicket at the start of the fourth over. Shehan Jayasuriya (0) followed de Kock back to the pavilion at the start of the sixth over as he failed to trouble the scorers.\n\nNauman Anwar and in-form Heinrich Klaasen carefully constructed a partnership that helped the Orcas cross the 50-run mark in the eighth over. Anwar (51) scored a crucial half-century before he lost his wicket in the eleventh over right as the Orcas were on the cusp of crossing the 100-run mark.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen was anchoring the Orcas innings, while wickets were falling around him. Shubham Ranjane (7) lost his wicket cheaply in the thirteenth over and was soon followed by Dasun Shanaka (10) back to the pavilion.\n\nWhile Klaasen scored a stunning half-century, Dwaine Pretorious (2) lost his wicket at the start of the eighteenth over. Imad Wasim (0) and Harmeet Singh (0) had lost their wickets by the end of the eighteenth over without troubling the scorers. Going into the final two overs of the second inning, the Orcas still needed 19 runs to win as the game was headed for a nail-biting finish.\n\nSpearheading the attack for the Orcas, Klaasen scored the first-ever century in Major League Cricket. As the game entered its final over, Seattle needed six runs to win and the Orcas pulled off a triumph thanks to a game-winning six by Klaasen off the second ball of the nineteenth over. Klaasen remained unbeaten with 110 runs off 44 balls as he single-handedly led the Orcas to victory.\n\nTrent Boult bowled superbly and picked up four wickets for MI New York, while Rashid Khan picked up two wickets. David Wiese and Nosthush Kenjige chipped in with one wicket each.\n\nMORE latest Major League Cricket (MLC) news"

        "date": "Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "The inaugural season of the Major League Cricket concluded at the Grand Prairie Stadium in suburban Dallas, with MI New York being crowned as the first champion. Stand-in captain Nicholas Pooran played a swashbuckling knock, scoring an unbeaten 137 runs off just 55 balls, which helped the Big Apple franchise secure victory against the formidable Seattle Orcas – a team that had appeared to be the strongest until the final match. At the halfway stage, Seattle’s 183 for 9 looked like a challenging total, but MI New York achieved the target with four overs left, thanks to Pooran’s superlative innings.\n\nThe morning after the end of Season 1, one thing is clear: MLC is here to stay.\n\nWhile some may view it as a bold prediction for a fledgling league that has just completed its first season and hosted fewer than 15 matches, the quality of entertainment and the passionate response from fans indicate that cricket has found a solid foothold in the United States.\n\nREAD: Breathtaking hundred by Heinrich Klaasen helps Seattle Orcas defeat MI New York (July 25, 2023)\n\nHere are a few things that serve as signposts that MLC will be embraced by the American audience and become a part of the US sporting landscape.\n\nQuality of cricket:\n\nThe quality of cricket in the first year of MLC has been above average. Many of the bigwigs that the teams signed did not fail to deliver. West Indies T20 international Nicholas Pooran, who singlehandedly won the final for MI New York, was the top scorer with 388 runs, at an impressive average of 64.66. Following him in the list of top scorers were two South African Orcas players, wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock who scored 264, and Heinrich Klaasen with 235 runs.\n\nWhile Pooran’s innings defined the final, Klaasen scored a similarly breathtaking knock when MI New York and Orcas faced each other in the final league game in Morrisville. He scored a 44-ball 110 containing 9 fours and 7 sixes to help Orcas defeat MI New York.\n\nAmong bowlers, New Zealander Trent Boult was the top wicket-taker with 22 scalps. Notable performances included Washington Freedom’s Mumbai-born left-arm fast-medium pacer Saurabh Netravalkar’s six-wicket haul for just 9 runs against San Francisco during the league stage.\n\nREAD: Washington Freedom was a no-brainer of an investment: Sanjay Govil (July 17, 2023)\n\nMany US stars also performed well, including Seattle’s Australia-born Cameron Gannon, who finished second among bowlers with 11 wickets, and New York’s Nosthusha Kenjige, who was born in Auburn, Alabama.\n\nThe excitement generated by these performances underlines the potential for cricket to capture the American imagination.\n\nFan engagement:\n\nFans, especially those from various South Asian diasporas, embraced MLC with both hands and showed up at the stadiums to root for their teams, braving the unusually hot July summer. In Morrisville, NC, most matches were sold out.\n\nREAD: Major League Cricket brings T20 competition to America (July 14, 2023)\n\nThe fan engagement in the first season shows that the foundation for cricket’s success in America is solid, given the presence of more than 6 million cricket enthusiasts from the South Asian American diaspora. Additionally, significant populations from cricket-loving regions like the Caribbean, Britain, and Australia add to the diverse and expansive fanbase that can sustain cricket in the US. This multicultural blend creates a unique cricketing community, ready to embrace the game with passion.\n\nMedia attention:\n\nMLC’s inaugural season received substantial coverage from major US news outlets such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, as well as prominent sports publications like ESPN. The interest shown by these media outlets, who previously viewed cricket as nothing more than a curiosity, indicates the sport’s growth trajectory.\n\nWhat does the future hold for MLC?\n\nWhile reaching the status of the four major sporting leagues — NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL — may be an unattainable goal for MLC in the foreseeable future, there is potential for it to reach popularity akin to Major League Soccer. Interestingly, MLC’s debut season coincided with the Major League Soccer debut of Lionel Messi, a sports superstar of global renown.\n\nAs Washington Freedom owner Sanjay Govil told the American Bazaar, there is enough space for cricket in the United States. America is known for its patronage of various sports, including golf, tennis, and lacrosse, providing ample opportunities for cricket to flourish outside the established leagues.\n\nREAD: Major League Cricket makes Viacom18 media partner in India (July 10, 2023)\n\nThe success of the inaugural season is likely to attract more elite and star cricketers from around the world, elevating the level of competition and increasing the game’s popularity. The presence of renowned players will undoubtedly draw more attention and create a ripple effect on the sport’s growth.\n\nAnother boost will be the construction of new stadiums. Already, teams like Freedom and Orcas are moving ahead with plans for their own stadiums, indicating their willingness to invest in the sport’s infrastructure. World-class stadium experiences will further enhance the appeal of MLC matches and encourage greater fan participation.\n\nOver time, MLC will add more teams. It is likely that those teams from the Indian Premier League that sat out this year will join during the expansion drive, as will men and women from the South Asian diaspora with deep pockets that missed out during the first round.\n\nAnother positive to emerge in the first season was the enthusiasm shown by some of the owners to be at the park and root for their teams.\n\nFor the final, MI owner Nita Ambani, the wife of billionaire Mukesh Ambani and the team’s superfan, flew all the way from Mumbai, indicating that the Ambanis see the US market as more than just an outpost of cricket.\n\nFreedom’s Govil was present for every match his team played. Seattle’s Sanjay Parthasarathy and Texas Super King’s Anurag Jain were also at the stadium rooting for their teams on many game days.\n\nThe success of MLC’s inaugural season demonstrated that cricket could find a secure home in America. The quality of cricket, the media attention, and the passionate fan response are clear indicators that the path ahead for MLC is promising. While challenges lie ahead, the sport’s vibrant and diverse fanbase, coupled with growing infrastructure and investments, is bound to secure cricket’s place as a beloved sport in the United States. The future of cricket in America is bright, and Major League Cricket is set to play a significant role in its journey."

        "date": "Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "A sell-out crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas last week witnessed the opening match of cricket’s latest T20 league, the Major League Cricket (MLC) that is taking place in the United States.\n\nSo far, the 200-mark has been crossed twice, a side has been bowled out for 50 and the temperature has crossed the 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) barrier amid a heatwave that hit the US state.\n\nThe MLC, founded in 2019 but launched in 2023, kicked off 16 years after the inaugural T20 World Cup and 15 years after the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is now the world’s biggest domestic T20 cricket league.\n\nAs the MLC moves from Texas to North Carolina, MLC’s co-founder Sameer Mehta spoke to Al Jazeera on how the league plans to stand out among the crowd, break into the sport-heavy US market and if cricket can win American hearts.\n\nAl Jazeera: MLC is not the first T20 league and definitely won’t be the last. How do you plan on making it stand out in the crowd?\n\nSameer Mehta: From my time running Willow TV [an online subscription-based viewing service], we realised that the US is a very, very viable market for cricket. There’s a strong audience here, especially the eight million expats. Now we have immense hunger from probably the best investors in the world, we’re building our own stadiums, we’ll be playing in the summer when there’s not much cricket going on and we have the second largest salary cap in the world alongside a few other leagues.\n\nWhat we really have are the 400 million people in the US that are going to discover the sport at some point. They will fall in love with the sport. For every fan we have, if we can get one more mainstream fan to be a fan of cricket, we will be the second or third biggest market in the world. That’s the ambition.\n\nIt’s not just to run a T20 league, there are plenty of those around the world, but to be up there and the mainstream Americans to follow the sport.\n\nAl Jazeera: Mainstream Americans have plenty on their hands right now with NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS and golf, among others. How confident are you that they will take up cricket?\n\nMehta: It will take time. The Indians and the Pakistanis will be the first fans. It’s our first season. We’ve just launched. We want to make sure we get the product right this year. Our absolute goal is that next year, when we have a full season, we want to market very heavily to the mainstream American fans and make them fall in love with the sport.\n\nThis country is a country of franchise sport. Every sports fan here is used to following three, four, five franchise teams. Even in football, all the top teams are franchises. Cricket should be no different.\n\nWe don’t want to compete with them [MLB, NBA]. We want to thrive off them. Americans are obsessed about sport. When they follow a sport, they follow it grandly. In this country, where the economics, the revenue, the way sport is handled, the way broadcast rights are handled, the way players are treated, it is just mind-boggling. If we have a slice of it, I’m more than happy. I don’t need to compete with football or basketball. We have a beautiful bat-and-ball game and the T20 version is perfect for the US audience. The sky is the limit out here.\n\nAl Jazeera: T20 cricket has been around for a while. Why has it taken a long time for a league to be launched in this market?\n\nMehta: I feel like things happen at the right time. Our view was when T20 took off and built roots, it matured to a point where it has become a world-class product.\n\nWe decided to launch the league in 2017-18. It took a little bit of time to make sure the ICC and everyone else was fully on board. We also did not want to play in makeshift stadiums. We said if we’re going to do it, we’ll do it properly. I don’t think it’s been that long, there’s no urgency to it. The sport has matured, it took T20 a decade to find its feet and now it is the dominant version of cricket in the world. T20 is where the world is shifting to and as far as the US is concerned, it’s the absolute right sport for the market.\n\nAmericans like to root for a team in the place they live in. American sport is hyper-local and that’s what you want to bring to franchise cricket.\n\nAl Jazeera: MLC is now being seen as a product to help promote the sport in the US. How do you feel about that and what role should the governing body play?\n\nMehta: As I said earlier, this country is one of franchise sport. If you want to come to the US, you have to play franchise sport, otherwise the sport can go elsewhere. Here, the only way to do it is via private capital and private stadiums. The governing bodies should do what they do and should absolutely try and collaborate with us … on usage of facilities and so on for the national teams. Franchises do things differently and are willing to invest and that’s how franchise sport is so popular. Governing bodies have smaller budgets and that’s not how a sport grows in the US. Frankly, both sides need each other.\n\nIn India, Pakistan and all those countries, the governing bodies have been around for a long time and receive massive budgets. For a new country like the US, where will they get any government assistance? It won’t happen. Private capital has to do it.\n\nAl Jazeera: What’s next for the MLC then? What will it look like post season 1?\n\nMehta: We’re moving very, very fast. Next year will be a full season. Right now, we’re playing at two venues. We’re hoping to expand that to four next year which is also the Cricket World Cup year in the US. That’ll bring a lot of attention to the sport and the league. Hopefully we’ll be able to share venues with the World Cup organisers and vice versa.\n\nThe plan is for each team to have a permanent home venue by 2025 or 2026. We feel pretty confident that by 2026, each team will be applying home and away. You have got to have local fans. Once we become the top three to four financial nations in the world in terms of cricket, the cricketers will follow… and the sport will grow to a point where five to seven years from now, we can be at the top."

        "body": "As Texan cricket tycoons go, Anurag Jain certainly cuts a more credible figure than Allen Stanford, the disgraced financier and Twenty20 promoter who notoriously landed a helicopter at Lord’s in 2008 and flaunted a crate that he claimed held $20m in cash.\n\nStanford, the flash, brash neocolonial chancer born near Waco, who sought to shape a cricketing empire from his base in Antigua, is serving a 110-year prison sentence in a Florida prison after his 2012 conviction in a Houston court for running a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.\n\nJain, meanwhile, grew up watching and playing cricket in India before moving to Dallas, starting a healthcare technology company and founding a venture capital firm with Ross Perot Jr, former owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and son of the late businessman who ran for president in the 1990s. They are investors in the Texas Super Kings, one of six Major League Cricket (MLC) teams in the inaugural tournament, which ends on Sunday with its championship match in Grand Prairie, midway between Dallas and Fort Worth.\n\n“This has been the best start-up I’ve ever done,” Jain beamed from outside a buzzy stadium suite where yellow-clad Kings fans mingled on Thursday ahead of a nine-wicket defeat to the Seattle Orcas, for whom the South African international Quinton de Kock bashed an undefeated 88.\n\nWhile Stanford came across as a Barnum with bails, the numerous wealthy and influential MLC investors, many of them of South Asian heritage and with technology backgrounds, are more modest and methodical. With an initial outlay of $120m and much infrastructure to build, this is not a get-rich-quick scheme.\n\n“We have a very clear path to where we think the league and the teams are going to be break-even and then profitable from then on … in a very realistic timeframe. We are not talking 10 years or anything like that. We would like to see that happen in the three-to-five-year horizon,” said Vijay Srinivasan, co-founder of MLC and of Willow TV, an American cricket pay-TV channel.\n\n“We are nowhere close to finishing our venues so there’s a lot of capital lined up to go into that,” he added. “This season was a short season, we do want to play a more robust home and away format so we’ll expand the league, more games, more venues.”\n\nTexas has a large South Asian population, with about half of the state’s 450,000 Indian Americans living in the Dallas area. “There is a good springboard of Indian, South Asian and Commonwealth diaspora that are here,” Jain said. “Eventually we’ll explore other markets just like soccer did in the US 30 years ago.”\n\nCrowds have been good, with several sell-outs, but MLC only used two grounds this year: the bucolic but modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, and the 7,200-capacity Grand Prairie Stadium. Finished in a rush just in time for the first game on 13 July, the converted minor league baseball stadium still bears faint traces of its past as the home of the now-defunct Texas AirHogs, from a board on a wall at the main entrance to the baseball motifs in the adjacent playground.\n\nThe Foodistaan Sports Bar & Grill looms beyond the boundary by one of the sight screens. Concessions outlets sold biryani and burgers, samosas and garlic fries. Also fried were the players, officials and few hundred fans who sizzled in the 102F (39C) heat during Thursday’s eliminator between the Washington Freedom and MI New York, which started at 3.30pm. It is absurd to hold any outdoor sporting event in Texas on a mid-afternoon in July, let alone with the region, like much of the nation, baking under a high heat warning.\n\nStill, falling in the southern hemisphere winter, the relatively quiet month allowed organizers to attract high-level talent such as De Kock, his countryman Faf du Plessis, and the Australians, Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch, as well as the West Indians, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell and Dwayne Bravo, to take the field alongside unknown domestic players.\n\nSanjay Govil, an IT entrepreneur who is the Freedom owner, said overseas players are enticed by the opportunity to spend a few weeks in the US – and by salaries that are on a par with high-grade T20 leagues around the world. England’s Jason Roy reportedly agreed a $400,000 two-year MLC deal – generous by any standards, and especially so since his contribution to the last-place Los Angeles Knight Riders this month amounted to three innings in which he scored 45, 7 and 2.\n\nMLC prepared for the tournament with a combine at a cricket complex near Houston built by an immigrant from Pakistan who made his fortune operating American fast-food franchises, and a player draft at Space Center Houston a few cover drives from mission control at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center.\n\n“I’m pleasantly surprised with all the quality of players that we’ve had, so many international stars,” said Damodhar Bhat, an India-born 42-year-old IT professional and cricket lover who travelled from Seattle with his son to watch Thursday’s doubleheader. “This looks very promising. I really wish it sticks around and hope that it does.”\n\nFor now, Grand Prairie is a temple where MLC preaches to the converted, but the 2024 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting with the West Indies, is an opportunity to promote the gospel. So too, above all, is the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, should cricket join the slate of sports.\n\nIf summers broiled by climate change are a challenge, another defining aspect of modern life, globalization, is an opportunity. “I do this ‘poll’, whenever I’m in an Uber, taxi, car, whatever. I’ve never heard of anybody who’s not heard of cricket. It’s a very connected world,” said Govil above the hum of an air-conditioning unit, pausing to stand for a rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner, hand over heart.\n\n“I think there’s going to be a huge evolution in how cricket is going to be played in the future. We had failed attempts with Kerry Packer and West Indies and so on and so forth. But I think the game has evolved a lot more and there’s a lot more commercial interest now thanks to the IPL and other leagues like The Hundred and the Big Bash.”\n\nIt is only 20 years since the T20 format debuted professionally in England and fifteen since the Indian Premier League was born. “The game has changed. The game has become shorter, faster, funner,” Jain said. “People like action … Offense, defense, all the time.”\n\nIt’s also created a more democratic environment; or at least a more capitalistic one. “You don’t have to be the best Test-playing country to be seen as a player on the global landscape,” Srinivasan said. “If you can put together a high-quality T20 tournament with the best players in the world and the highest standards then there’s a place for you.”\n\nWillow TV has broadcast games in the US along with the CBS Sports Network, with several other countries also airing live contests. High-end production values have included slick graphics and a range of camera angles. The former India great Sunil Gavaskar, one of the television commentators, examined the pitch on Thursday wearing a cowboy hat.\n\nTexas now has a cricket team named after the Chennai Super Kings, an IPL team based nearly 10,000 miles away. It might be a dubious branding decision in a place that had a distinctly strained relationship with its last monarch. But perhaps it’s not so odd in the broader context.\n\nCulture clash is not the right phrase for what’s happening in Major League Cricket. This is not a collision. It’s a combination. A blending, the logical outcome of modern media and mass migration, horizons widening as technology erodes boundaries.\n\nA post-pandemic backlash against globalism is impacting how the world creates and consumes all kinds of stuff. But not in sports, where the international TV and digital content supply chains remain sturdy, market forces rule, workers are peripatetic and power and profits are increasingly interconnected across frontiers. After all, earlier in the week, North American-owned Wrexham played North American-owned Manchester United in San Diego and Saudi Arabia (its world golf conquest ongoing) signed Liverpool’s captain.\n\nFour MLC teams are tied to IPL entities while the other two partnered with Australian regional federations. Sports gambling is illegal in Texas, among other states, but, underlining the importance of overseas viewers, an international online betting company is a major sponsor of the league.\n\n“Whatever we do, whoever the owners are, ultimately this is an American league, it’s an American product,” Jain insisted, pointing out that matches were timed to appeal to US prime-time viewers.\n\n“Our line-ups, all of them have a strong US domestic component, so this is a platform for growing American cricket in all respects. This is not meant to be anything other than that,” Srinivasan said. “We’re adding more venues. Increasing the standard of the domestic US pool. Some US players have had significant match-changing performances in this tournament which is a good thing, I think. What we’ll see is that’s going to lead to a more competitive US team like the IPL did for the domestic Indian player pool.”\n\nOverall, he argued, MLC is “truly what the US is – it’s an amalgamation of a lot of things. I think that’s the identity of our league.”"

Off stump goes cartwheeling. He is too hot handle, rams a heat-seeking yorker on off and Phillips goes without troubling the scorer. He tried to jam the bat down but he was a touch late and the furniture was already disturbed. Excellent execution and what a fiery celebration to follow. 30 / 3\n\n5.6 to Mukhtar Ahmed , What is going on? WF in a huge spot of bother as Mukhtar Ahmed lobs one straight to mid-off where Stoinis takes an easy catch comfortably, reverse cupping as the ball descended on him. Exceptional over from the Pakistan quick! Just launched the ball straight into the hands of the fielder, pitched up at a searing pace on off and he couldn't get much elevation and power behind that shot, couldn't get up and over the fielder. 33 / 4\n\n13.5 to AJ Hosein , Climbing through from back of a length, slow and slammed into the surface; he steps away outside leg stump and tries to get on top of it, doesn't have much pace to work with and despite generating quite a lot power behind that shot, he couldn't clear Anderson at wide long-on and has to go!. 82 / 6\n\n17.1 to AJ Pienaar , Short of a length on fifth stump line, picked he length quickly and lofts it high into the air but didn't get all of it, Allen at long-on takes a stupendous catch, safe as a house. 109 / 7"

        "date": "Thu Sep 28 21:38:53 2023",
        "body": "Despite the sport long being popular in the Chicago area, none of the original MLC cities are in or even near the Midwest. As the league stands now, the teams are based in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe league is still finding its footing and is unlikely to announce any new teams in the immediate future, but expansion is the ultimate goal for MLC — and Chicago is ripe to host a team.\n\n\"There are definitely some really strong markets for cricket in the U.S. that we don't currently have a team for, and Chicago is certainly high on that list given the size of the market and the demographics,\" said Tom Dunmore, MLC's vice president of marketing. \"Chicago certainly has a lot of the strong characteristics for a major-league cricket team in the future. It's a really good potential market; all the metrics support it.\"\n\nThat ripeness is in large part thanks to the city's strong overseas immigrant population. The sport originated in England but has since become dominant in other Commonwealth countries. The Indian Premier League, for example, is now home to the most elite level of play.\n\n\"Cricket is a sport driven a lot in the U.S. by immigration from South Asia, particularly,\" Dunmore said. \"That's where the sport is most popular — in India, in Pakistan and so forth.\"\n\nThose migration trends were front of mind for the league as it scouted the original U.S. host cities and will remain a factor in future expansion efforts, therefore making Chicago an appealing contender as an expansion city.\n\n\"We are looking at the top 10 markets for cricket in the country, and that's driven a lot by the patterns of immigration,\" Dunmore said. \"Teams are going to be based in big cities, big metro areas with big South Asian populations. We think they are going to be very successful in those cities.\"\n\nThe league has already seen early signs of success. The inaugural tournament in July saw packed crowds at the league's new stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\n\"What we showed this summer by building a stadium and then selling it out for most of the matches is that fans will come and watch it,\" Dunmore said. \"The desire for tickets was really beyond what we could serve during the tournament, so the tournament has shown that there is a market for it.\"\n\nThe new league is filling a void in the U.S. cricket community, which has long lacked professional-level play. \"They have not had a domestic league to support or stadiums to go to,\" Dunmore said.\n\nLeaders in the Chicago cricket community see the professional league as an opportunity to rally the city around the sport. \"That's the ultimate goal,\" said longtime local resident Fazale Haq, a board member for the Midwest Cricket Conference. \"We want to provide the grassroots for the league.\"\n\nChicago has a long history of both recreational and minor-league cricket play. Matches have been held at Washington Park on the city's South Side since the 1930s, and the park's four fields remain some of the most popular grounds to play in the area. Still, the sport has yet to break into the broader Chicago market.\n\nHaq sees the professional game as something that can transform the sport into a spectacle that even non-players enjoy.\n\n\"Right now, cricket is player-focused,\" he said. \"As soon as we transition that into an entertainment stage, I think that will change the game. It's not about cricketers watching other cricketers play. It's about casual mom and dad coming in and paying for it.\""

They bring tremendous experience and expertise in support of MLC’s plans to launch a transformative Twenty20 league and establish America as one of the world’s leading homes for international cricket events.”\n\nMLC had been slated to launch in 2021, though this was pushed back due to Covid-19. The league is now anticipated to begin play next year.\n\nOther notable MLC investors include Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan, who bought into the league through his Knight Riders Group (KRG). The organisation entered into a long-term strategic partnership with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), which pledged US$1 billion in May 2019 to help USA Cricket develop the sport in the US.\n\nEarlier this month, it was announced the KRG, which owns the Indian Premier League’s (IPL) Kolkata Knight Riders, would be part of a reported US$30 million investment to build a 10,000-seater cricket stadium near Los Angeles.\n\nThe venue will serve as the home of MLC’s Southern California-based franchise. It could also be used as a potential venue for events such as the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, should cricket be included at the Games."

Narine will instead remain in the USA, leaving Surrey with only one overseas player for Saturday's showpiece in Australia's Sean Abbott.\n\nAlec Stewart, Surrey's director of cricket, said: \"We were aware when we signed Sunil for the T20 Blast that he could be unavailable for Finals Day due to his pre-signed contract with the Knight Riders in the MLC.\n\nRelated\n\nSomerset keep faith in process in bid to end Finals Day pain\n\nPepper adds the spice in enterprising Essex's title charge\n\nSunil Narine's mission impossible: 75 hours, two continents, four games\n\nMLC wants more England cricketers, but not to 'start a war with anyone'\n\nSteven Smith in contention for Major League Cricket action in 2024\n\n\"However, all of the subsequent conversations with the various parties since he arrived for the group games and leading into this week were that we would have him back for Saturday, so it's disappointing and frustrating to lose a player of Sunil's quality at such late notice.\"\n\nKieron Pollard, Narine's long-time team-mate and close friend, jokingly suggested to ESPNcricinfo that Surrey - the county he represented last year, alongside Narine - should have laid on a private jet to ensure his availability.\n\n\"Maybe they should have sent some private jets for him, make him comfortable and then he might have been able to do it pretty comfortably!\" Pollard said. \"It's totally up to the individual how you plan out your contracts, because there are going to be tournaments that are overlapping.\"\n\nECB regulations require players to be registered with a county in the group stages of a competition in order to be available for the knockout stages, so Surrey will not be permitted an overseas replacement for Narine.\n\nDan Moriarty, their left-arm spinner, played his first Blast game of the season in their quarter-final victory over Lancashire and will likely retain his spot. Cam Steel, the legspinning allrounder, is the closest thing Surrey have to a like-for-like replacement for Narine, while Dan Worrall and Jordan Clark may also come into contention.\n\n\"I genuinely think it's a wonderful opportunity,\" Gareth Batty, Surrey's coach, told ESPNcricinfo. \"We've got a great squad. The worst part of my job is telling very fine players that they're not playing. I hate it. It is the worst thing. It's another opportunity to tell someone that they are playing.\n\n\"I truly believe that we have lots of people that can play at any point across any competition and be a real success. Obviously Sunny is a wonderful player, but we'll have a wonderful player coming in.\"\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98"

        "body": "The inaugural edition, which featured six teams - Seattle Orcas, MI New York, Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom, Sanfrancisco Unicorns, and Los Angeles Knight Riders - saw packed houses, huge interests and swelled-up viewership, prompting the organisers to dream bigger.\n\nHT launches Crick-it, a one stop destination to catch Cricket, anytime, anywhere. Explore now!\n\nThat the final will be played in front of a full house was expected but the kind of crowd that gathered in Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas during the league games, took everyone by surprise. Over the course of the nine match days at the venue, it was 80% to its capacity on average every day, while the Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina saw a sell-out in its six match days.\n\nIt means that more than 70,000 spectators saw season one of MLC, bringing in $2.8 million in ticket sales revenue. This is an astounding amount for any match played on US soil, excluding India's regular trips to Lauderhill to play T20 Internationals against the West Indies.\n\nCricket's popularity in the world\n\nSports entrepreneur and investor, Joe Pompliano in his podcast ‘The Joe Pomp Show’, termed cricket as the second-most followed sport in the world. Pompliano said cricket, with 2.5 billion fans worldwide, is only behind football in terms of global popularity. To add more context to his numbers, he compared the Instagram followers of star India batter Virat Kohli with leading sportspersons across the globe.\n\n\"For context on how big cricket is outside the US: Virat Kohli has 256 million Instagram followers, which is more than LeBron James, Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Shohei Ohtani, Patrick Mahomes, and Tiger Woods....combined,\" he said.\n\nShohei Ohtani, the current heartthrob of USA baseball fans, has only 6 million followers.\n\nBig market for cricket in the USA\n\nQuoting data from a report, Pompliano added that India is the biggest market for cricket with close to 550 million people engaging with the sport annually. As astonishing as this may sound, there are no other full member nations in the top five apart from India. The data says China is the second-biggest market for cricket with 408 million people showing interest in cricket annually while the USA is third on the list with 63 million interested in cricket per year.\n\nDespite near-zero participation in ICC tournaments, such a high demand for cricket in the USA comes largely from its immigration population mainly from cricket-crazy countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Singapore. This huge interest was one of the primary reasons behind MLC's birth. Big investors saw an opportunity to cash in on the craze.\n\n\"A group of investors that includes the CEOs of Microsoft and Adobe has raised $120 million to build Major League Cricket in the United States,\" said Pompliano.\n\nReports state that this could just be the beginning of what could turn out to be the biggest sporting league in the USA. The rousing success of the first edition of the MLC has already given rise to the organisers considering bigger stadiums in New York and Los Angeles. According to an ESPNCricinfo report, MLC could collaborate with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to build a 34,000-seat pop-up venue in New York City at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bron.\n\nIf that proposal gets the greenlight then It could be one of the three venues for next year's ICC T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by USA and West Indies.\n\nAnother major factor going in MLC's favour is the fact that the USA Cricket Association has given sole rights to MLC to host professional cricket tournaments in the country. That means MLC organisers have a monopoly and they can be the biggest channel between USACA and ICC to take the game to new heights."

        "date": "Thu May 25 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Jason Roy will become the first current England player to sign up for the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) competition in the US after forfeiting the final months of his contract with the ECB, having first secured reassurance that the move will not endanger his chances of international selection. Roy has been offered a two-year deal by Los Angeles Knight Riders and will travel to the US at the end of Surrey’s T20 Blast campaign.\n\n“I hope to play for England for many more years, that remains my priority,” Roy wrote in a statement. “It benefits me as an England player to play as much competitive cricket as possible. Just to be clear, my priority is England cricket, especially with a World Cup soon upon us.”\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders share ownership with Kolkata Knight Riders, the Indian Premier League franchise for whom Roy played this season. Though the MLC schedule has not yet been released he could play as many games for their teams this year as he will for Surrey, which would represent a significant step on the much-discussed path towards year-round franchise contracts.\n\nHis county, however, expect to retain his primary allegiance and if they qualify for the Blast’s finals day, which will be played two days after the start of the MLC on 15 July, his departure would be delayed. The MLC Twenty20 competition is due to end on 30 July, two days before the start of the Hundred and three before Roy would be due at Lord’s to play his first game for Oval Invincibles.\n\nNo England-qualified player can play in a foreign league without being issued with a no-objection certificate by the ECB, and after what Roy described as “clear and supportive conversations” with the governing body it was happy to oblige. In a statement the ECB said it did so “on the proviso that he gives up the remainder of his incremental contract”, and that it has “absolute confidence and faith that Jason is committed to England cricket”.\n\nRoy is not the only player on an ECB contract to have been contacted by MLC teams. David Willey has so far turned down approaches, not wanting to jeopardise his potential involvement in this autumn’s 50-over World Cup, while Reece Topley has also been sounded out, but is recovering from the dislocated shoulder that ruled him out of the IPL. Having missed much of the last year through various injuries Topley is keen to play as much cricket as possible for whichever teams want to have him, but will need to prove his fitness before making any new commitments.\n\nRoy, 32, has become a key player for England’s white-ball sides since his debut in 2014, and was part of the team that won the 50-over World Cup in 2019. But after a miserable summer last year he was dropped from the T20 squad for the World Cup in Australia, which England also won, and downgraded from a full central contract to an incremental contract.\n\nThese deals are worth about £70,000 and are intended for “players who may feature for England on a less predictable basis”. They are considerably less lucrative than the rumoured £300,000 Roy has been offered for perhaps as little as five weeks’ work, split over two years, in the US.\n\nNone of those on full central contracts with the ECB are expected to play in the MLC this year – the competition also clashes with the last two Ashes Tests – and though several high-profile white-ball specialists from other countries have already signed up, including Quinton de Kock, Glenn Phillips and Wanindu Hasaranga, many more will wait to see if the debut season is a success before deciding whether to get involved.\n\nThough the inaugural competition will last only 17 days and clash with only one day of senior white-ball cricket in England it is expected to expand into August from 2024, forcing players to choose between it and the Hundred."

        "body": "Other England players, including Reece Topley, are also weighing up the merits of the move\n\n2:35\n\nRoy contract termination a significant moment for cricket\n\nEngland white-ball players are negotiating releases from their ECB contracts in order to take up lucrative offers to play in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States.\n\nEnglish players on full central contracts are unlikely to feature in MLC this year but Jason Roy - who holds an incremental deal with the ECB - has confirmed plans to terminate his contract in order to play in the league.\n\nIn a statement, the ECB said: \"England men's white-ball batter Jason Roy has informed the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he wishes to take up an agreement with Major League Cricket in the USA later this summer. The ECB have agreed for him to play in the competition on the proviso that he gives up the remainder of his ECB incremental contract, which both parties have agreed to.\n\n\"The ECB wish to clarify that this decision will not affect Jason's selection for England teams going forward. We have absolute confidence and faith that Jason is committed to England cricket.\"\n\nReece Topley, Roy's Surrey and England team-mate, is weighing up the merits of the same move, though his decision may depend on his fitness status after shoulder surgery last month.\n\nRelated\n\nKieron Pollard: 'A lot of people are sprinting through those franchise doors'\n\nRussell, Narine, Roy and Ferguson join Knight Riders in Los Angeles for MLC\n\nWasim Khan: International cricket must find a way to 'co-exist' with T20 leagues\n\nMcCullum: 'Naive' to think players would turn down franchise deals\n\nBoult: 'It felt bizarre to have a Test on down the road and not play in it'\n\nMLC is due to take place from July 13-30 at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and has significant backing from both India and Australia: four of the six franchises have investors who own IPL teams, while Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales have stakes in the other two.\n\nThe league's inaugural season features a minor clash with the English summer: the semi-finals and finals of the T20 Blast take place on July 15, while there are two rounds of County Championship fixtures between Finals Day and the start of the Hundred on August 1. But there are concerns within the English game that MLC is likely to expand in future and could clash directly with the Hundred.\n\nAs a result, the ECB will not give No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) that would enable contracted players to feature in MLC. And while players are unlikely to negotiate a release from full white-ball contracts to play in the US, such a move would make financial sense for those on incremental deals.\n\nThe ECB incremental contracts are worth around £66,000 per year and effectively act as a top-up to county salaries. Six players have such deals for the 2022-23 contract cycle: Harry Brook, Dawid Malan, Matthew Potts, Roy, Topley and David Willey.\n\nESPNcricinfo understands that Surrey are expecting Roy to play MLC - most likely for LA Knight Riders - between the end of their Blast season and the start of the Hundred, and that he would have to agree a release from his incremental contract to do so. If Surrey reach Finals Day, Roy will be available for them and miss the start of MLC.\n\nRoy played for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2023 and is understood to have held informal discussions with the franchise about the possibility of a contract to play for their teams in other leagues, including MLC. His representative declined to comment.\n\nTopley has not signed a deal to play in MLC but is also understood to be considering his options. After leaving the IPL early with a shoulder injury, he underwent surgery last month and his contractual decisions will depend in part on the progress of his rehabilitation.\n\nTopley outlined his white-ball ambitions on Surrey's live stream last week: \"If you'd have asked me when I was young, I'd have said I'd love to play 100 Tests for England,\" he said. \"Now, if you asked me, [I'd say] I'd love to go to as many IPLs as I can. I don't think the stigma around saying you want to play and be successful in white-ball cricket is that bad.\"\n\nEngland contracts run from October to September, so requesting a release from an incremental deal at this stage of the year would cost players around £20,000. Each MLC franchise has a purse of $1.15 million (£930,000 approx.) - to cover between 16 and 19 players, of which nine can be from overseas - so any deals would offset the loss of earnings from leaving an England contract.\n\nThe ECB is in the process of revamping its central contract system for the 2023-24 season to adapt to the growth of franchise leagues, and any decisions to leave incremental contracts will not be held against players in selection moving forward.\n\nFollowing other reports in various media outlets on Thursday, Roy issued a statement on his social media accounts which said: \"Following a bit of unwanted speculation over the last 24 hours, I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will 'walk away from England'.\n\n\"Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer. I hope to play for England for many more years, that remains my priority.\n\n\"I've had clear and supportive conversations with the ECB about participating in Major League Cricket. The ECB were happy with me to play in the competition as long as they didn't have to pay me for the remainder of the contractual year.\n\n\"As a single format player with no central contract I wanted to take the opportunity to play this competition as there are currently no scheduling conflicts with England. It benefits me as an England player to play as much competitive cricket as possible.\n\n\"Just to be very clear, my priority is England cricket, especially with a World Cup soon upon us. It is for me, and for any player, the greatest honour to receive a cap to play for their country.\"\n\nA Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) spokesperson told ESPNcricinfo: \"This is covered by the comprehensive standard playing contract agreed by the ECB, counties and the PCA. It is completely at the employers' discretion whether players are issued an NOC in-season.\"\n\nSeveral leading T20 players including Marcus Stoinis, Quinton de Kock, Wanindu Hasaranga, Anrich Nortje and Glenn Phillips have already been unveiled as overseas signings in MLC, with Trent Boult and Adam Zampa expected to join them in the coming weeks.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98"

        "date": "Fri Jul 14 05:19:08 2023",
        "body": "By 7.30pm in Grand Prairie, when Ali Khan set off on his run-up, temperatures in this corner of Texas hovered around 102 degrees. A warm breeze blew across the ground but there was barely a cloud in the sky or a patch of green on the wicket. Ideal batting conditions, all told.\n\nNot that Khan – opening for the LA Knight Riders – would have thrown the ball to anyone else. This was a moment to cherish for the USA star. He was tasked with bowling the first ball of Major League Cricket: this country's newest professional sports league and this sport's latest attempt to break America.\n\n'A giant leap across the Atlantic,' broadcasters called it. 'Cricket's American dream'.\n\nNo pressure, then. And so Devon Conway – of New Zealand and the Texas Super Kings – waited as Khan sent the ball into the pitch and towards the unknown.\n\nThe fast bowler believes that, in time, this T20 tournament will trail only the Indian Premier League.\n\nThe next two and half weeks should tell us if he is on to something. Or seduced by blind faith.\n\nThis was the first of 19 games split between this converted baseball ground near Dallas and a 3,000-seater stadium in North Carolina.\n\nDeep pockets and grand plans mean top international talent is spread across the six teams – the Knight Riders, the Super Kings, the Seattle Orcas, the San Francisco Unicorns, Washington Freedom and MI New York. Jason Roy gave up his England contract to come over. Liam Plunkett is here, too.\n\nAlso among the foreign legion are South Africa's Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada, Australia's Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa and Aaron Finch and West Indians Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell.\n\nThey will line up alongside local talent such as Pakistan-born Khan. Around 6,000 fans flocked here on Thursday night, including Sri Lanka legend Mahela Jayawardene. Organizers reckon they could have flogged a few thousand more.\n\nBut it was a sell-out and a terrific atmosphere. 'T-S-K, T-S-K' rang out even before half centuries from Conway and David Miller fired the Super Kings to 181/6. In response, South African-American Rusty Theron helped reduce the Knight Riders to 7-3.\n\nRussell led a fightback, hitting 10 boundaries and sending one out of the stadium. It was all in vain as the Super Kings won by 69 runs to send yellow flags waving into the Texas sky, and crown an opening night flush with promise.\n\nBack in March, when Major League Cricket gathered for its swanky draft four hours south of here, the symbolism was obvious. They chose the NASA space center in Houston for a reason. But will the next fortnight really mark lift-off for cricket on this vast frontier. Or just another false dawn? Another of what Elon Musk might term a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'.\n\nBecause we have been here before. Recent decades have seen several botched attempts to break America. The first incarnation of Major League Cricket – founded in 2000 – barely got off the ground.\n\nNo wonder organizers of this venture admit to having doubts.\n\nBut they have at least given themselves solid foundations. As well as an impressive cast of imports, Major League Cricket have enlisted some serious backers - both financial and cricketing.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is among several Silicon Valley types pumping in money, while IPL owners have stakes in four of the six teams. The other two are supported by Australian state bodies.\n\nThose close ties could lure stars such as Australian Steve Smith over in the future.\n\nBut organizers can't afford this to become just another T20 Tournament in an already crammed field. They know that the cricket must sell itself. And they know they have to lean on their surroundings.\n\nHence the pre-game pageantry and aerial acrobatics: they want to combine American glitz with cricketing guile.\n\nOn Thursday night, though, Grand Prairie was laced with South Asian flavor.\n\nFans were given a free flag and whistle on entry. Some wore Stetsons. Many more wore shirts carrying the names of IPL teams and Indian stars such as MS Dhoni. Stalls around the ground, meanwhile, were supplied by Foodistaan, a local Indian restaurant.\n\nIndian expats offer this tournament an immediate support base and the plan was to target 'low-hanging fruit' – existing cricket fans – first. For this to last, however, for MLC to attract more overseas stars, for cricket to even dream of rubbing shoulders with baseball – America's Pastime - new fans will have to come. Preferably before next year, when the US will co-host the T20 World Cup.\n\nThis opening night came had its teething problems – a few loose shots and dropped catches and a half-time drone show that fell victim to technical glitches.\n\nBut it ended with fireworks, after Miller, Russell and Co had provided plenty of pyrotechnics.\n\nNow we wait. To see if cricket lights up America at last, or fizzles into the dark once more."

        "date": "Thu Aug 10 18:02:34 2023",
        "body": "On 13th July 2023, cricket enthusiasts in the United States geared up for an exciting transformation in the world of sports as Major League Cricket (MLC) took its first step onto the American stage. Major League Cricket hosted its first game at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas after a few false dawns. This time around it got major support from tech and celebrity investors along with big franchises coming in to play for different cities. The tournament is in a round robin format with 6 participating teams. Four out of 6 teams are owned by business entities which already own teams in other leagues like IPL and others have investor names like Satya Nadella and Shantanu Narayen.\n\nCricket leagues have seen immense growth across the world. IPL which was started in 2008 and now has the second most viewership just behind NFL. The success of these leagues is directly correlated with the fan engagement as more fans leads to more viewership which leads to more sponsors which leads to more investments in the league. MLC being at such an embryonic stage has the potential to disrupt the US market with the right use data and analytics to boost fan engagement.\n\nThe convergence of technology and sports has given rise to a data revolution in recent years. Leagues worldwide are embracing analytics to gain crucial insights into player performance, fan behavior, and overall game dynamics. IPL teams use metrics like Most Valuable Player Index (MVPI) to identify the finest players. This index is a weighted composite score of the different attributes of a player, including hard-hitting ability, finishing ability, consistency, and running between the wickets for batsmen, and economy, wicket-taking ability, consistency, and crucial wicket-taking ability for bowlers. In 2014, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) hired a data analysis company to analyze data and develop strategies for the team. Using this analysis, KKR won the trophy that year, demonstrating the effectiveness of data analytics in IPL.\n\nOpportunities exist for growing leagues such as the MLC to leverage data & analytics to enhance the fan engagements and improve the quality of the game in the following ways:\n\n1) Targeted Marketing and Communication: Understanding fan demographics and behavior will enable growing leagues to develop targeted marketing campaigns. This will ensure they market it to the right audiences which will increase chances of fan conversion and retention.\n\n2) Enhanced In-Stadium Experiences: With help of data analytics growing sports leagues can provide fans truly immersive experiences. From optimized seating to interactive engagement zones.\n\n3) Optimized Pricing Strategies: Leagues can use data to study pricing analytics and the growth and demand of the game to reach optimized prices for their tickets.\n\n4) Performance Analysis & Team Development: Teams can use data to scout for talent for the drafts and even analyze their own players and develop them in the right areas.\n\n5) Winning Strategies: Data can help design strategies that can help teams take a certain approach to the game that results into a win.\n\n6) Fantasy Cricket Leagues: Capitalizing on the growing popularity of fantasy sports, growing leagues can offer fans opportunity to participate in fantasy cricket leagues.\n\nBig sports league across the world has taken these analytics initiative to grow. NFL partnered with AWS to implement cloud-based data strategy that uses analytics, ML and AI to gain a deeper understanding of every aspect of the game and build a better football experience for fans, players and teams. NFL has used data to make 50 rule changes to reduce risk of injuries to players which is a major concern in the sport. NFL uses Amazon QuickSight that quickly builds customizable and interactive dashboards which results in better fan engagement. In MLB we have seen Boston Red Sox winning 4 championships after hiring Tim Tippett who designed prototype for teams’ analytical program. That’s not winning one since 1918. NBA has seen the game change so much since analytics backed up that a 3 pointer is a better shot to take that a 2 pointer.\n\nThe entry of MLC into the American sports landscape holds immense promise for the country’s sports industry. Cricket once considered a niche sport in the USA, now has an opportunity to carve its place alongside more established sports like basketball, baseball and football. As MLC makes its debut on the USA soil, embracing the potential of data and analytics emerges as a key consideration for coming years, aiding them in solidifying their presence on the world's grandest sports stage. Drawing inspirations from the successes of leagues like IPL and NFL, MLC has an opportunity to build a strong bond between cricket and American fans through personalized experiences, targeted marketing and data driven strategies.\n\n#MLC #sports #sportsanalytics #analytics #sportsbusiness #AI #texassuperkings\n\nReferences:\n\n1) How Data Analytics Have Changed Baseball Forever (montclair.edu)\n\n2) Fueling the future of sports: How the NFL is using data to change the game–on the field, in the stands, and in your home | TechCrunch\n\n3) Major League Cricket is selling out every game and it’s already a massive success - SBNation.com\n\n4) Major League Cricket: Why USA T20 league could rival biggest franchise tournaments - BBC Sport\n\n5) NBA Data Analytics: Changing the Game | by Nabil M Abbas | Towards Data Science\n\n6) The Winning Formula: Data Science and Sports Analytics in the IPL (linkedin.com)"

I don’t know what the Australian calendar is next year but I believe there is enough space for him to potentially play.”\n\nMehta also said Smith will play an active role in the tournament in the future as he said,“Long-term … our view is that we might see a lot of him in the US.”\n\nSmith himself in September last year said, “There’s obviously leagues popping up everywhere around the world now, and I think you’ll probably see more players in the back end of their career going down that route, so it’s potentially something I’ll look at in the future.”\n\n“The US has been a market that cricket’s been trying to get into for some time. So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes,” he added.\n\nHowever, Smith cannot participate in this year’s competition as Australia will tour England for the five-match Test series for the Ashes. In 2024 after the T20 World Cup which is also to be hosted in the USA along with West Indies Smith will have a window to play in the league.\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC is all set to start on the 13th of July this year in Texas and the league is estimated to be worth 174 million Australian dollars.\n\nEach of the six franchises is based in San Francisco, Dallas, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Seattle and New York City the teams will have a $1.5 million salary cap and can secure 18 players, with a maximum of seven overseas players."

        "date": "Wed Jul 19 03:22:02 2023",
        "body": "As the sun sets on traditional American sports, a new dawn beckons - Cricket. The ripples of excitement for Major League Cricket (MLC) are spreading far and wide, promising to revolutionise the American sports landscape. This quintessentially British game, with a rich tapestry of tradition, is poised to make a grand entry into the heart of America, aiming to captivate audiences with its unique blend of strategy, skill, and suspense. The key question remains: Will Major League Cricket hit a sixer in the American sports industry, or will it be caught out? Read and explore the potential of this new entrant and discuss a little bit more about this American Venture.\n\nHistory of Cricket in America\n\nThough not widely recognized as an American sport today, cricket has a rich history in the United States. In the early 1700s, it was brought to the American shores by English colonists. By the mid-1800s, cricket was a well-established sport in America, with Philadelphia being the hub of American cricket. The USA and Canada played in the first-ever international cricket match in 1844.\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nMajor League Cricket is an ambitious project launched by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in partnership with USA Cricket. The goal is to establish a professional T20 cricket league in the United States, showcasing the best of cricket to the American audience. The inaugural season took place on July 13 2023 and will be concluded on July 30 2023.\n\nACE has made significant strides in developing infrastructure for cricket in America. They've taken over the management of a baseball stadium in Texas, which will be refurbished into a dedicated cricketing venue. Furthermore, ACE has plans to build additional stadiums and training facilities across the country. The league is expected to provide a platform for American cricketers to showcase their skills and help raise the standard of cricket in the country.\n\nMajor League Cricket Teams\n\nThere are six teams set to lock horns with each other. Those are Texas Super Kings, Seattle Orcas, MI New York, Washington Freedom, San Francisco Unicorns, and Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nClick here to get the full fixture –MLC 2023\n\nThe Potential of Major League Cricket in America\n\nThe potential for cricket in America is immense. The United States is a melting pot of cultures with a large immigrant population from cricket-loving countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Caribbean. This provides a ready fan base for cricket.\n\nMoreover, the T20 format of it is likely to appeal to the American audience. It's a shorter, more dynamic version of cricket, packed with action. It's similar to baseball in terms of duration and pace, making it easier for Americans to understand and enjoy.\n\nThe commercial potential of MLC is also significant. The American sports market is one of the most lucrative in the world. If it succeeds in capturing even a fraction of this market, it could spur phenomenal growth for cricket.\n\nThe Future of Major League Cricket\n\nThe future of it largely depends on its execution. If done right, MLC could revolutionise the American sports landscape. It could provide a fresh alternative to traditional American sports, offering a unique blend of strategy, skill, and suspense.\n\nThe key to MLC's success will be to build a strong connection with the American audience. This means investing in grassroots development, promoting the sport in schools and colleges, and creating opportunities for young Americans to take up cricket.\n\nFurthermore, MLC will need to leverage its diverse fan base, catering to both traditional American sports fans and immigrants from cricket-loving nations. Strategic marketing, exciting gameplay, and engaging fan experiences will be critical in attracting and retaining fans.\n\nCan Major League Cricket Become America's Next Big Thing?\n\nThe question of whether MLC can become America's next big thing is intriguing. There's potential for sure. The United States is a sports-loving nation with a diverse population and a lucrative sports market. The T20 format of MLC, with its fast pace and high action, could potentially resonate with the American audience.\n\nHowever, turning potential into reality is not going to be easy. It faces stiff competition from established sports. It will need to overcome numerous challenges, from building awareness and interest in cricket, to fostering local talent and competing for viewership and sponsorship deals.\n\nYet, the journey of soccer in America provides hope. Once a fringe sport, soccer has grown tremendously over the past few decades, thanks in large part to the success of Major League Soccer. If MLC can replicate this success, cricket could indeed become America's next big thing.\n\nConclusion: MLC is Ready to Make History\n\nMajor League Cricket has the potential to revolutionise the American sports landscape, offering a fresh alternative to traditional sports. The stage is set, the players are already on the pitch, and the cricketing world watches with bated breath. Will MLC hit a sixer in the American sports industry, or will it be caught out? Only time will tell."

        "body": "The most ambitious attempt yet to establish professional cricket in the United States gets under way on Wednesday when wickets will be pitched for the start of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket.\n\nWith backing from four franchises in the Indian Premier League, including the league’s most successful teams the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings, MLC has plenty of money and expertise behind it, unlike prior attempts to crack the American market.\n\nAs well as financial muscle and television deals, MLC has also been sanctioned by USA Cricket and the International Cricket Council -- rubber stamps that have been absent from short-lived private ventures in the past.\n\nLike the IPL, the league will play the shortest and most explosive version of cricket, Twenty20, and has recruited some experienced international players.\n\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\n\nWhile cricket has long been played at a recreational level in the USA -- the first-ever international game being between the USA and Canada at New York in 1844 -- there remains a shortage of facilities for the sport in a country where baseball is beloved.\n\nA former baseball park in North Texas, Grand Prairie Stadium, has been transformed into a cricket-specific venue and will be the site of the opener when the Texas Super Kings face the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\n\nWhile organizers expect good levels of support from fans with family backgrounds in cricket-loving countries, they aim to gradually win over the broader American public.\n\n“The goal is to grow the game of cricket and expose the sport in the USA,” tournament director Justin Geale, told AFP.\n\n“We’ve got some of the best players in the world that can actually represent the product, do it justice. So it’s going to be a good quality game of cricket that gives us the best chance to show existing fans and new fans the game.\n\n“We’ve got as far as anyone ever has. So after all the false starts, I think it’s finally here.”\n\nPart of the groundwork that MLC did was been the creation of Minor League Cricket, a 26-team competition which began in 2021 to spark domestic player development.\n\nThe teams will feature a maximum of six foreign players and a minimum of five domestic players and Geale says developing a talent pool for the USA national team is a big part of the mission.\n\n“Building talent here domestically is one of our big pillars for sustainability,” he said.\n\nIt will be a challenge for coaches and captains to manage teams with experienced international players alongside emerging domestic players but South African Robin Peterson, head coach of the Mumbai Indians-backed MI New York team, says it will work.\n\n“In my experience, I found that the local boys tend to learn quite a bit playing alongside these superstars,” he told AFP.\n\n“I’ve seen it firsthand in the SA20 and even if you look at the growth and trajectory of the Indian cricket since the inception of the IPL, it has just been amazing the amount of talent that they’re producing.\n\n“I see the league here playing a similar role for USA cricket.”\n\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia’s Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\n\nPeterson is optimistic that T20, much more than longer forms of the game, has the ingredients to win eyeballs in the American market.\n\n“It’s becoming more entertainment,” he said. “It speaks to the American sporting psyche where the players are a lot more physical, fitter, stronger, hit the ball further.\n\n“It’s an exciting project. I think it’s about time people start taking cricket seriously in America.”"

        "body": "At a redesigned former minor league baseball stadium in Dallas on Thursday night, another entrant into the crowded T20 cricket market will hope to finally break into America.\n\nIt took a decade before owners of Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises started to become profitable. Given that four of the six team backers in Major League Cricket (MLC) — the first-ever professional T20 league in the US — also own IPL sides, the nascent competition has already been given rich grounding.\n\n“Like any start-up you stay patient and keep plugging away,” Venky Harinarayan, co-owner of San Francisco Unicorns, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead More: T20 franchise contracts set to change cricket's global outlook\n\nA reported $120m (£92m) has initially been pumped in to launch MLC, which has landed some heavy hitters to fund the project, not only from the IPL franchise coffers but also from technology and media sectors. Notably Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (MSFT), who is part of the Seattle Orcas ownership group, and Adobe Inc (ADBE) CEO Shantanu Narayen.\n\nThe four IPL owners are from Delhi Capitals (Seattle Orcas), Kolkata Knight Riders (Los Angeles), Chennai Super Kings (Texas) and Mumbai Indians (New York). The other MLC teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom, both with Indian links.\n\nTalks began around five years ago when the International Cricket Council (ICC) rebooted USA Cricket and cleared up the operating body after years of governance issues. American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) were also taken on as investors, with the four founders granted a license to run a T20 league.\n\nWatch: Major League Cricket coming to Grand Prairie\n\nHarinarayan, a partner at San Francisco Bay-based Rocketship, the early-stage venture capital fund, said: “There was interest from ICC for a T20 league to promote the sport. That factor felt like it fit really well. Ashes notwithstanding, it’s the format that’s starting to take over.\n\n“It was clear pretty early on that it wouldn't be a case of writing a cheque and magic would happen. There was a fair amount of work at ground level to take it off the ground over the last three years.\n\n“It’s a labour of love to some degree. I don’t think any of the owners are doing it purely from a financial outcome. All of us being business folks, the long term viability of cricket in the US and the financial outcomes are positive. In the near term it’s about being in investment mode and trying to grow the seeds.”\n\nFor now, the San Francisco Unicorns won’t be playing in California. The inaugural MLC season will be played in Dallas — starting on 13 July with a sell-out between Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders — with the six teams playing across 18 days at the 7,000-seater Grand Prairie Stadium and at a venue in North Carolina.\n\n“There is a lot going for cricket in the US,” added Harinarayan, a Chennai native. “There is a big expat population with South Asian and Indian Americans. There is incredible passion from the expats and the other piece which is interesting is the pretty high per capita income as well.\n\n“That in my mind is the business case and being able to expand to a broader market. Like every start-up you look for a beachhead. You don’t try to own everything from day one.”\n\nThe US market presents both challenges and opportunities for the team owners — and whether MLC can redirect the cricket passion to the current cities where the expats live.\n\nRead More: IPL: Gujarat Titans, 'the Manchester City of T20 cricket'\n\n“We know they are super passionate,” added Harinarayan. “We know they support cricket teams. Let’s say you are a Pakistani living in San Francisco and you support the Pakistan team. The question is whether you can support your local team.\n\n“In an ideal world we would love to play in every city and build fan engagement. The goal is to play where the franchises are represented. There is the opportunity in the medium term and the T20 format is really well suited to an American audience.\n\nThe four IPL franchises aiming for more global riches have given the MLC a “huge shot of credibility” in its first season. However Hemant Dua, Delhi Daredevils’ former CEO, believes that the competition still has challenges in both broadcasting and infrastructure.\n\nHe said: “From a broadcast point of view, it’s not great timing for India if the games are going to happen in the evening [US time]. If you have the games in the morning, it would be beaming to India in the evening.\n\n“They still don't have the infrastructure and it will take time to build stadiums. Once all that is done, things will probably change. So this is going to be more testing than anything else.”\n\nThe hope is that MLC will be boosted when the US host matches in next year’s T20 World Cup alongside the West Indies, while the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles may include cricket on the Games’ programme.\n\nThe MLC is also not short of world-class players: Faf du Plessis, Kieron Pollard, Wayne Parnell and Anrich Nortje are just some of the stars who will be on show this month.\n\nRead More: How the IPL has impacted 'dying' Test cricket\n\nHarinarayan said: “We have been energised by the interest of the top players who want to play in the US. Every one of our teams would start up pretty well against any team in any T20 league.\n\nFormer Australia captain Aaron Finch will lead the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural edition, alongside the likes of Aaron Finch, Liam Pllunkett and Corey Anderson. The Unicorns have also partnered with Australian body Cricket Victoria, who will provide a general manager, coach and cricket operations.\n\n“It’s rare you get the chance to create a start-up in the world of cricket and that’s exciting,” added Harinarayan.\n\nWatch: How cricket is gaining traction in the US"

        "body": "2.4 to MD Patel , length delivery that follows the batter outside leg. Patel has a swish at it anyway and misses. de Kock collects and whips off the bails in a flash. He appeals for the stumping, and the third umpire has been called into action again. Patel did drag his back foot out of his crease but did he get back in time? It seems very, very close. Most of his back foot is on the line but there could be a smidgen just behind, at least from one angle. The other square angle, though, hints there is nothing behind the line and Patel might be in trouble here. Indeed. Touch-and-go, and this time, it is Patel who has to walk back!. 15 / 1\n\n12.5 to N Pooran , edged and taken! Imad has broken through! Slowed up beautifully on a length outside off. This one seems to grip in the surface and spins back sharply. Pooran, surprised by the turn, can only waft at it and the ball kisses the top edge before nestling into de Kock's gloves. Excellent take by the Orcas keeper, considering that took a considerable deflection!. 132 / 4\n\n13.1 to KA Pollard , and he accounts for Pollard first ball, would you believe it?! A long-hop on off stump that Pollard should have hit into the trees. Instead, he is just a little hurried on the stroke and cannot get the elevation or the power he desires. Arrows it straight to deep mid wicket, where Gannon does the rest. The umpires want to check Harmeet's front foot but he has gotten just enough behind the line to make this a legal delivery!. 132 / 5\n\n17.1 to TH David , yes, it does! David bites the dust! Full delivery just outside off stump. David tries to tonk it into tomorrow but this is just full enough to not allow him to get under it. The ball takes the inside edge, cannons off the pads and into the stumps. Harmeet gives himself a bit of a send-off to boot, and this is a massive wicket at this stage!. 165 / 6\n\n12.5 to SS Ranjane , has Ranjane been strangled down the leg side?! Back of a length delivery that seems to slide down the leg side. Ranjane has a swing at it and according to the umpire, he misses. Pooran, though, is convinced that Ranjane has gotten a tickle to this and with Pooran now being skipper, he has no qualms in going upstairs. The ball is pretty close to the glove and Snicko returns with a gigantic spike when the ball is next to the glove. Pooran has gotten it right, and the Orcas are now four down!. 123 / 4\n\n17.1 to D Pretorius , and he nicks off Pretorius! Innocuous back of a length delivery outside off and all Pretorius had to do was pat it for a single and turn the strike over to Klaasen. Instead, he tries to smash the cover off the ball and ends up feathering it through to Pooran. The Orcas lose another, and this will put further pressure on Klaasen!. 175 / 6\n\n17.2 to Imad Wasim , gone first ball, oh my! Slower yorker on off stump that dips devilishly and very late. Imad has no clue about this and is way too early into the stroke. The ball squirms past the bat and smashes him on the back pad, right in front of middle stump. The umpire raises his finger and Imad does not even bother with the review. Boult is now on a hat-trick!. 175 / 7\n\n17.4 to Harmeet Singh , cleans him up with an absolute corker! Another beautifully disguised and executed knuckle-ball. It pitches on a length just outside of and seems to nip bac in. Harmeet, like Imad, is all at sea and sees the ball breeze past the bat before flattening off stump!. 176 / 8"

        "body": "Steve Smith is reportedly a chance of playing cricket in the United States next year after conducting secret talks with bosses of a new American T20 league.\n\nThe inaugural Major League Cricket competition gets underway in July this year, played across three weeks in Texas and North Carolina. The six-team tournament has received financial backing from wealthy Indian businessmen and celebrities, with more than AU$174 million invested by the likes of Microsoft boss Satya Nardella and Bollywood legend Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nEach of the six franchises — based in Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Seattle and New York City — has a $1.5 million salary cap to secure 18 players, with a maximum of seven overseas stars.\n\nWatch Australia’s Tour of India.

Start your free trial now >\n\nLast week, Cricket NSW announced a strategic partnership with MLC that would allow American players to feature in NSW Premier Cricket and Australian players to participate in the American T20 tournament.\n\nAdditionally, CNSW has also agreed to a high performance partnership with the Washington DC franchise — New South Wales is expected to contribute players and staff for the team.\n\n“With the global cricket landscape currently undergoing significant transition, we view the United States as a market with immense growth potential,” CNSW chief executive Lee Germon said in a statement.\n\n“Cricket NSW’s track record in high performance cricket and elite match operations is second to none and we believe we can bring a raft of experience to MLC and the Washington D.C. franchise in the coming years.”\n\nSmith, who has turned New York into his second home, will not be available for this year’s MLC competition because it clashes with the Ashes, but News Corpreports the 33-year-old has been in talks with the competition’s bosses about an appearance in 2024.\n\nThe Men’s T20 World Cup is scheduled to get underway in the United States and the West Indies in June next year, and Smith could have a vacant window after the tournament.\n\n“We’ve been in touch with Steve about his plans and what he’s thinking,” MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta told News Corp.\n\n“What he’d love to do at some point is play cricket in the US as his schedule permits.\n\n“His view was that if he could make it work and if we could make it work – I know this season, he has commitments. I don’t know what the Australian calendar is next year but I believe there is enough space for him to potentially play.”\n\n“Long-term … our view is that we might see a lot of him in the US.”\n\nEarlier this summer, Smith said it would be “pretty cool” to finish his playing career in the United States, where he and his wife Dani announced their engagement in 2017.\n\n“There’s obviously leagues popping up everywhere around the world now, and I think you’ll probably see more players in the back end of their career going down that route, so it’s potentially something I’ll look at in the future,” Smith told the Sydney Morning Herald in September.\n\n“The US has been a market that cricket’s been trying to get into for some time. So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nThe United States has been earmarked as one of cricket’s growing markets, with the nation’s\n\nfinancial power and sizeable South Asian diaspora fast-tracking the sport’s development.\n\nThe first season of the MLC is slated to begin on July 13 in Texas."

        "title": "Major League Cricket's conundrum: who exactly is an American player?",
        "date": "Sun Jul 30 18:20:00 2023",
        "body": "MI New York showed it's possible to be successful while using USA players, but will MLC mandate their inclusion in future?\n\nAs the first year of Major League Cricket builds to a crescendo on Sunday night in Grand Prairie, Texas, the tournament final will feature an MI New York side whose stars have dominated the stats columns in the event.\n\nNicholas Pooran enters as the leading scorer with 251 runs as well as the most sixes in the tournament with 21, while Tim David is also in the top five in runs scored with 199 at an average of 49.75 and a strike rate of 171.55 and the second most sixes in the tournament with 16. Trent Boult is the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 19, eight more than the nearest bowler. There's also a spinner in the MI New York squad who is very impressively leading an important category in T20 cricket. But it isn't Rashid Khan.\n\nThis name might not have been on the tip of the tongue of any casual fan at the start of the tournament when asked to name one of the event's best bowlers. But left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige's league-leading 5.58 economy rate stands out for another very important reason in this fledgling American T20 franchise league.\n\nRelated\n\nMLC final week: Nicholas Pooran, and a bit of this and that\n\nKenjige: 'We have a responsibility to do the right things all the time'\n\nWho qualifies as a local cricketer in MLC?\n\nDallas metroplex resident Kenjige, 32, is one of just nine US-born players on MLC rosters, and one of only two to actually make anyone's starting XI along with MI New York team-mate Steven Taylor. He has been a USA national team player since 2017, much-loved and respected within the US community for his unrivalled work ethic, yet one who was very much unheralded on the global stage before this tournament began. But the support that he and other USA players have received from MI New York management is a blueprint for promoting local players in MLC going forward.\n\n\"I think you have to win and develop at the same time,\" MI New York head coach Robin Peterson said during a post-match press conference at the halfway stage of the tournament when discussing his team's selection policy regarding the visibility of USA players in their squad. \"It's not either or. That's the job we're here to do. Players from the Associate nations and the USA national team, they need to become used to and ingrained in the pressure of having to perform. That's part of their development in this league. Yes, we do have a keen development angle, but at the top of our mind is always trying to win and you can learn a lot from winning.\"\n\nWhen other franchise leaders were asked the same question during the tournament, the answer was generally that winning comes first. But MI New York has shown that it is possible to walk and chew at the same time.\n\nHeading into the tournament final, a total of ten players with USA caps have made 56 appearances in the starting XI in 18 matches. But MI New York have led the way with 21 of those selections spread across four players. Aside from Kenjige, opener Shayan Jahangir is third on the team's runs chart behind Pooran and David with 154 at an average of 25.66. MI New York has also picked Taylor and USA captain Monank Patel for more than half the matches played. They also took three other USA players in the draft - Kyle Phillip, Jessy Singh and Saideep Ganesh - and when Phillip was ruled out of the tournament after his bowling action was reported at the World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe, his place was taken by another US-eligible player in Slade van Staden.\n\nBut most of the other franchises have fallen short when it comes to giving USA players a platform to shine. San Francisco Unicorns, who failed to make the playoffs, did not start a single capped USA player. Yet it is not just the what but the how this has come about that is of particular note.\n\nOn one hand, players like Saurabh Netravalkar for Washington Freedom and Cameron Gannon for Seattle Orcas have shown that, given a chance, USA players are more than capable of holding their own. Former USA captain Netravalkar registered the tournament's best bowling figures of 6 for 9 against Unicorns and ended with a team-best ten wickets. Dual national Gannon, who last represented USA in 2019 but on either side of that appearance has committed his time to Sheffield Shield cricket in Australia, is the joint-leading wicket-taker for the other tournament finalist Orcas with 11 wickets at an average of 14.09.\n\nOn the flip side, most franchises have exploited MLC's nebulous definition of \"domestic player\" to mainly pick non-USA eligible players - many of whom had a negligible impact - to fill their domestic quota. Contrary to the Global T20 Canada and the UAE's ILT20, a pair of leagues who mandate a minimum number of three and two domestic players respectively in each starting XI - and clearly define them as someone who is eligible for or has been capped for Canada or the UAE - MLC officials determined that a player could meet that standard simply by merely pledging to \"hold a 'qualified visa', have established their 'primary and permanent residence' in the US, and will continue to satisfy the ICC's guideline regarding ten out of 12 months for three consecutive years\".\n\nIt opened the door for the farcical situation of Chaitanya Bishnoi, who landed in the USA merely days before the MLC draft for domestic players in March but was taken in the fourth round for $40,000. Though not as egregious an example, former Pakistan international Mukhtar Ahmed was playing domestic cricket in Faisalabad as recently as September 2022 before being taken as a domestic player in March's MLC draft for the second round price tag of $65,000.\n\nBishnoi went on to make 52 runs in four innings (entering at No. 8 in three of his four innings) and bowled three overs for Unicorns. Mukhtar's returns were perhaps even more negligible: occupying prime real estate at No. 3 in the batting order every match for Freedom, he scored 78 runs at an average of 13.00 and a strike rate of 105.40 with a best of 20.\n\nThis raises pertinent questions. A: Why are players who have played internationals for other countries being regarded as locals if they have not qualified yet by ICC rules to play for USA? B: Shouldn't a player like Mukhtar, who is currently ineligible to play for USA and has played for Pakistan previously, be regarded as overseas and have to compete for overseas slots with the likes of Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf? C: Did any such player genuinely raise the standard of the league, thereby perhaps justifying the leniency in the rules that allows such picks in place of a US-eligible player?\n\nThere is another wrench in the equation of local players though. There are cases like England's Liam Plunkett, New Zealand's Corey Anderson and Sri Lanka's Shehan Jayasuriya - players who married American citizens and migrated to the USA for family reasons totally unrelated to MLC.\n\nPlunkett has made considerable efforts to establish links in the local Pennsylvania sports cricket community, mainly through academy coaching, and the same is true of Anderson in the Dallas area. But Plunkett is not eligible to play for USA and few, if any, promotional media segments organised in the build-up to the tournament have attempted to identify him as anything other than one of England's heroes from the 2019 World Cup final win. He was even introduced in his opening spell of the tournament to TV audiences around the world by MLC broadcast commentator Pommie Mbangwa as the \"50-over World Cup winner from England\".\n\nIt would not seem unreasonable to establish a middle-ground category for players like Plunkett who are in a type of limbo: England international career done, but now firmly entrenched in the US cricket community despite not being eligible to play for USA. Why not ensure a minimum number of US-eligible players in the XI while also making room for a few \"wildcard domestic\" players? At least it would go some way towards ending the charade of pretending to portray Plunkett as something he is not, nor has Plunkett ever tried to be, while also curbing the practice of declaring players \"domestic\" at the 11th hour.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Global T20 Canada's policy of three Canadian players in the starting XI was not always so. In year one, the GT20's original rules stated that four Canada players needed to be drafted into each squad, but there was no mandate to play any of them in the starting XI, and many teams chose not to. It was only Saad bin Zafar's magical Player-of-the-Match performance in the tournament-final win by Vancouver Knights that seemingly opened eyes to the fact that Canada players could and would shine, if only given a chance.\n\nTime will tell if MLC adjusts their roster policy for the second year of the league to mandate a minimum number of US-eligible players in the starting XI in the same way that GT20 and ILT20 do. Until that time comes, MI New York have led the way in showing that whether by force or by choice, USA players are capable of holding their own both against and alongside some of the biggest names on the global T20 franchise circuit.\n\nPeter Della Penna is ESPNcricinfo's USA correspondent @PeterDellaPenna"

        "body": "The world cricket's ecosystem is slowly seeing a paradigm shift towards franchise cricket and the entry of Indian Premier League franchises in the United States through the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket (MLC) could be a significant step in that direction. (More Cricket News)\n\nWith Kolkata Knight Riders (Los Angeles), Chennai Super Kings (Texas), Mumbai Indians (New York) and Delhi Capitals (Seattle Orcas) taking ownership or making significant investments in four of the six franchises (the other two being Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns), the cricketing landscape is going to change forever.\n\nEven the two franchises which don't have IPL investments are also owned by persons of Indian origin. San Francisco Unicorns' top investors are Venture Capitalists Venky Hariharan and Anand Rajaraman, who have got Australian state side Victoria on board.\n\nWashington Freedom is owned by Indian American Sanjay Govil along with New South Wales state cricket body from Australia. Not to forget Seattle has Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella as one of the investors.\n\nBut the IPL franchises are now expanding their bouquet of teams across leagues in the West Indies, UAE, South Africa and now US is another untapped market that wasn't being explored for a long time despite the Asian diaspora craving for some regular cricket show at least once a year.\n\nOn Monday, early morning India time (Sunday night in Houston), the likes of former Australia captain Aaron Finch (San Francisco), Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas), a former South African skipper and even now a batting mainstay, premier pacer Anrich Nortje (Washington), Sri Lanka's top T20 freelancer Wanindu Hasaranga (Washington), dashing all-rounders Mitchell Marsh (Seattle) and Marcus Stoinis (SF Unicorns) are the first lot of quality internationals picked up by 'Draft System', which is a Major League thing.\n\nIn major US sports like basketball and baseball, there are no auctions held and only the draft picks, and hence that has been followed by the Major League Cricket as well.\n\n\"A private cricket league in the US is very different from private leagues in, say the UAE or South Africa. But in terms of revenue model, I expect the MLC to be much more successful in coming years,\" said Hemant Dua, former CEO of erstwhile Delhi Daredevils, who has worked in franchise business model of sport for years.\n\nDua, then explained why USA has potential to be successful.\n\n\"Building infrastructure is the least of the problems in the US. Also, the Asian diaspora that (Indians, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans) comprises of people with more white-collared jobs and more disposable income than majority of the Asian diaspora in the UAE.\n\n\"Plus the UAE league is more dependant on international players, but Indians in US will support their locals too. You need to factor in all these issues. One thing what MLC organisers need to look at is Indian audience timings to garner greater broadcast revenue.\"\n\nWE MIGHT SEE MORE RETIREMENTS IN FUTURE IN INDIA\n\nThe club versus country debate has been raging for some time. The BCCI doesn't allow its active cricketers to play any other leagues apart from IPL but the start of Major League Cricket in US could see a lot of domestic retirements in India because of the propensity to migrate to the US.\n\nTake the case of Unmukt Chand and Milind Kumar, who have found takers in the inaugural season after chucking their domestic cricket careers in India, which wasn't going anywhere.\n\n\"If you are not ensured earning of at least 15 crore from IPL in five years, or you aren't a top-line India international with endorsements and Rs 50-crore plus earnings, why would you stay back?\" an IPL franchise source told PTI while discussing the possibilities.\n\n\"A retirement from all forms of cricket in India opens avenues to play multiple T20 leagues, earn at least 6-8 crore per year for 4-6 months of work and also maintain a fine work-life balance. But, yes, this holds true for only skilled T20 players with no ambitions of playing red-ball cricket and I can vouch, there are many,\" he added.\n\nWhile the ICC has already set the next five years' FTP in place after consultation with the various major international cricket boards, the lure of six months of work and six months' leave and plying trade in only private leagues, is a reality that is knocking hard on the establishment's door.\n\nRecently, the custodians of the game, MCC, after its annual meeting stated: \"The men's cricket schedule in 2023 is saturated with franchise competitions, which overlay and compete with the ICC Future Tours Programme (FTP) of bilateral international cricket, recently released until 2027. The only gap in the combined schedules this year is in October and November when the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup takes place in India.\"\n\nThe Federation of International Cricketers Association (FICA) had released its annual report a few months back, which had stated that around 40 per cent of the current cricketers in the market are freelancers and there are 49 per cent, are ready to reject central contracts for plying trade in private leagues.\n\nSome interesting days lie ahead for all the stakeholders in world cricket."

        "title": "Major League Cricket: Why USA T20 league could rival biggest franchise tournaments",
        "date": "Thu Jul 13 08:00:09 2023",
        "body": "After many false dawns, professional cricket is finally poised to cross the much-coveted frontier into the United States.\n\nTo an ever-expanding list of global T20 franchise leagues comes the addition of America's Major League Cricket (MLC), which some believe could be the biggest disruptor the sport has seen for some time.\n\nWith the inaugural tournament's first game taking place on Thursday, 13 July, BBC Sport lifts the lid on a competition with weighty aspirations.\n\nThe recent history of cricket in the United States has been riddled with broken promises and failed enterprises that have sunk almost without trace.\n\nChoosing Nasa's iconic Houston space centre for its glitzy inaugural player draft held earlier this year, MLC will hope it does not suffer similar problems.\n\nThe initial 19-game season will feature six teams - MI New York, Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, Seattle Orcas, San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom - competing in regulation T20 format matches over a 2.5-week period.\n\nAlthough because the US is an associate member of the ICC, the matches themselves, like the International League T20 held in United Arab Emirates earlier this year, will not count towards a player's official T20 domestic career statistics.\n\nConfusingly, the locations in each team name bear little relation to where matches will be played, with a dearth of suitable venues meaning the entire tournament will take place either at a converted former baseball stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, or a smaller cricket facility in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nIt is something Justin Geale, MLC tournament director, is keen to address: \"To grow local fans we need to play in local areas. Playing at two venues is not ideal.\n\n\"The model needs to get to home and away fixtures pretty soon, so we plan to increase to around a 30-game season next year. We've already got plans next year to pop up in San Francisco.\n\n\"I would hope within three to five years we can have good-sized stadiums of 10 to 20,000 seats in our key markets. That's our aim.\"\n\nThe initial infrastructure issues have had little impact on the quality of players attracted to the league, with a host of marquee names on board.\n\nEngland's sole representatives are World Cup winners Jason Roy, who gave up his England white-ball contract to play, and Liam Plunkett. It is understood MLC also sounded out Moeen Ali before his decision to come out of retirement for the Ashes.\n\nOther seasoned internationals include Afghanistan's Rashid Khan, South Africa's Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada, West Indians Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell, and Australian pair Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch.\n\nNo surprises here: money talks. The tournament has been co-founded by The Times of India Group, India's largest media conglomerate, and secured a hefty $120 million (£94m) in initial funding through some influential backers, including the likes of Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella.\n\nOwners of Indian Premier League (IPL) clubs - Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals - have stakes in four of the six MLC teams, with the other two supported by Australian state organisations Cricket New South Wales and Cricket Victoria.\n\n\"The beauty of having the IPL teams on board gives us credibility and access to players, coaching staff and great opportunities for the domestic players here,\" said Geale.\n\n\"Our first fundraising round brought in a lot of high-net-worth individuals, including some very successful Silicon Valley people, who were very good at running businesses. Our model, though, is that the cricket has to be very good.\"\n\nEach of the six teams had a purse of $1.15m (£900,000) to spend on a squad of between 15 and 18 players, putting the finances on par with the likes of The Hundred, despite having only one-third as many matches.\n\nRoy is likely to earn in the region of £150,000 for his stint in the MLC, dwarfing the £60,000-£70,000 he earned annually from his incremental England contract.\n\nWith Indian owners, Indian co-founders and a whole host of backroom staff employed by IPL franchises, it is easy to assume the MLC might aim to be a smaller copycat version of the world's most lucrative cricket league.\n\n\"There's no shying away from the fact that, commercially, India is the centre of the cricket world,\" said Geale.\n\n\"But we're absolutely trying to create our own brand. It's definitely not the mini IPL. Our aim is to carve out our own identity. MLC needs to be an American product as much as we can make it.\"\n\nMLC will tap into traditional US sporting rituals by playing the national anthem before games, adopting cricket's equivalent of baseball's ceremonial first pitch and providing glitzy entertainment during the innings break.\n\nGeale continued: \"If you go to Minor League Baseball, they hustle so much to get people in. In Dallas, where we are looking to engage the local community, we'll have to do a lot more of that.\n\n\"It could be a 'cricket meets baseball night', a 'Bollywood night' or an 'Australian night'. Ultimately, the goal would be to take some of the best of America and the best of cricket, and put them together.\"\n\nThe evening scheduling of matches is a conscious decision to target a local market rather than prioritise television viewers overseas. Nonetheless, matches will be shown in the UK on satellite channels.\n\nThe opening match - between Texas Super Kings and LA Knight Riders - is sold out. Locally, Geale admits they will have to aim for the \"low-hanging fruit\" of people who already know the sport before they can attract newcomers.\n\n\"While we don't just want an Indian demographic, that's commercially where we're going to have to start,\" he said. \"But we are also tapping into local schools and clubs to get new people because that's where the upside is.\n\n\"We're realistic. It's not going to be full every night. Our stadium holds 7,000 and we're working really hard to get the local support.\"\n\nIt has strong financial backing, an impressive roster and has been three years in the making, but in an oversaturated franchise league market there are few guarantees the MLC will thrive. The long-term hope is that the US could be the sport's untapped superpower.\n\n\"I hate the word 'potential' because it's been used too much in the US, but there is a huge market,\" said Geale. \"Where else do we go if we want to grow the game? If it's not China or Russia, it's got to be the US.\"\n\nAmerica's star pace bowler Ali Khan is confident, saying: \"I think it's going to be huge. I think after the IPL this is going to be the second biggest league.\n\n\"Why? Because the market is here, the sponsors are here, the money is here. It's a big country. There is so much opportunity. It's life-changing for us.\"\n\nFor an American team that recently made the Cricket World Cup Qualifier for the first time in almost two decades, there is hope the tournament helps grow a fledgling domestic scene and improving national side.\n\nHowever, excitement is not universal, with concerns on this side of the Atlantic over a tournament that takes place during the English summer.\n\nGiles White, Hampshire director of cricket, said: \"Assuming it's a success, that day is coming where they will want to attract the best players. If those players come from this country then it could detract from the competitions played over here.\"\n\nBut success is an assumption not even Geale is willing to make: \"It's something that keeps me up at night. We have given ourselves the best chance to succeed. Whether it does or not, I can't control that. On paper it sounds great, but let's see. What an adventure though, eh?\""

        "body": "oi-Avinash Sharma\n\nNew Delhi, March 16: Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises have invested in the upcoming Major Cricket League (MCL) in the USA. The IPL teams have already invested in domestic T20 leagues in West Indies, South Africa and UAE.\n\nFour IPL franchises Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Capitals are going to own a team in the MLC T20 league in the USA.\n\nWhich IPL franchises bought teams in MLC T20 in USA?\n\nThe four franchises have bought stakes in the MLC T20. KKR were the earliest investor in the league and bought the Los Angeles franchise.\n\nKKR were also the first franchise to own a team in an overseas league when they bought stakes in the Caribbean Premier League to co-own Trinbago Knight Riders in CPL.\n\nMumbai Indians, like KKR, will be running the New York franchise on their own. MI have team SA20 and ILT20 titled MI Cape Town and MI Emirates respectively.\n\nThe Chennai Super Kings have partnered with a local firm for the Dallas franchise in Texas. While Delhi Capitals will be in charge of the Seattle-based franchise in partnership with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and others.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas have entered into the debut season of the competition, in partnership with Delhi Capitals.

        "body": "The Major League Cricket got under way in Texas, and the most serious attempt yet to establish a domestic competition in the United States provided all the ingredients of a modern Twenty20 league.\n\nFans at the purpose-built cricket stadium on Thursday, just a 15-minute drive from Dallas Fort Worth airport, were decked out in the yellow shirts of the victorious home side, the Texas Super Kings, and were treated to the familiar sight of big sixes and non-stop action.\n\nThe Super Kings won by 69 runs after making 181 for six and then bowling out the Los Angeles Knight Riders for 112.\n\nAny concerns that cricket in the US might not be the real deal vanished when the action got under way and the crowd began cheering the big hitting of the home team.\n\nThe stadium previously belonged to the now defunct Texas Airhogs minor league baseball club, but since taking over the venue, MLC has spent over $20m making it cricket-specific.\n\nFor viewers watching the TV broadcast, it would have been hard to tell the difference between MLC and the other T20 tournaments that have sprung up around the world.\n\n‘Such a grand event’\n\nWith international players competing alongside domestic talent from the US national team, the standard of play was clearly professional and the field and wicket looked up to scratch.\n\nThat was in marked contrast to many previous, short-lived attempts to “break the American market” with one-off events in unsuitable venues, and was also light years apart from much of the domestic cricket, which for years was played on matting tracks.\n\nTexas’ South African bowler Rusty Theron was taken aback by the success of the opening game.\n\n“I am actually a little bit emotional, to be honest. This is such a grand event. There was an unbelievable atmosphere and I want to thank each and every individual who has come out here,” he said.\n\nSuper Kings batsman David Miller, who was awarded Player of the Match for his hard-hitting 61 from 42 balls, including four sixes, was also impressed.\n\n“It’s fantastic to see such a great turnout and the facilities have been fantastic. I think there have been a few guys, kind of questioned around what it was going to be like but it shot the lights out here,” said the South African, one of a number of players with a background in the world’s top Twenty20 competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nMLC has backing from four IPL franchises including the Mumbai Indians, whose New York team began play on Friday.\n\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\n\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\n\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia’s Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns, and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India."

The Indians organisation already owns a team in South Africa’s SA20 competition and another outfit in the UAE-based International League T20 (ILT20). As well as investing overseas, Reliance also recently bought a Women’s Premier League (WPL) franchise under the Mumbai Indians banner.\n\n“With our entry into the first T20 franchise cricket league in the US, I hope we are able to establish Mumbai Indians as a global brand of fearless and entertaining cricket,” said Indians owner Nita Ambani.\n\nThe Indians’ acquisition comes after the Capitals were confirmed to be partnering with the Seattle Orcas franchise. The IPL team’s co-owner GMR Group has bought a stake in the Orcas as part of the deal, joining an investor group that includes Satya Nadella, the chairman and chief executive of Microsoft and Soma Somasegar, the managing director of Madrona Ventures. Similarly to the Indians, the Capitals have also previously bought teams in SA20, ILT20 and in the WPL.\n\n“We see America as the new frontier for cricket’s growth globally, and the Pacific Northwest provides an incredible opportunity for us to bring the resources of GMR Sports to the region and help the Seattle Orcas build a team competing for championships,” said Kiran Kumar Grandhi, managing director and chief executive of GMR Group.\n\nMeanwhile the Super Kings are investing in the Texas-based MLC franchise. According to ESPNcricinfo, the IPL outfit have partnered with a local investor to buy the team. It is the second overseas purchase for the Super Kings, who also own a SA20 team.\n\nThe trio join fellow IPL franchise the Kolkata Knight Riders as investors in MLC. The Knight Riders have been long-time backers of the competition, with its owners the Knight Riders Group contributing part of the US$30 million investment to build a 10,000-seater cricket stadium near Los Angeles, a venue which will be the setting for the IPL franchise’s partner MLC team.\n\nA pair of Australian state cricket associations have also formed partnerships with the remaining franchises. The Washington DC-based Freedom team has aligned with New South Wales Cricket in a partnership to boost the US team’s infrastructure, with a similar deal in place between the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket Victoria.\n\nThe MLC recently held its player draft this month, with the season to begin in July.\n\nSportsPro says…\n\nThe possibility of investing into MLC seems too good an opportunity to pass up for the owners of the Indians, Capitals and Super Kings, given the chance to market their brands into a huge untapped market for cricket in the US.\n\nWhile already invested in teams based in South Africa and the UAE, the prospect of gaining American fans through their involvement in the new competition could prove to be hugely beneficial. For the MLC, the involvement of IPL teams adds credibility and expertise as it looks to establish cricket in a country that hasn’t yet embraced the sport.\n\nThe overseas investments also give the IPL a significant say in how the global T20 ecosystem is run. With investments across a number of competitions, the Indians, for example, can control where their players deploy their talents, the makeup of the calendar and the use of central resources. As the reach of the IPL continues to grow, this ability to control external competitions will undoubtedly shape the sport’s future."

Nadella has previously spoken of the passion he has had for the sport since childhood.\n\nMLC plans to use the funds primarily to build premier cricket-specific stadiums and training centers “to develop a new generation of American star cricketers,” the league said in a news release. The infrastructure, which includes plans to build a facility at Marymoor Park in Redmond, Wash., will “transform the landscape for professional cricket and enable the United States to host global events over the next decade and beyond.”\n\nThe Seattle region is already home to three adult cricket leagues with more than 3,500 members. A booming interest in youth programs, which GeekWire profiled in 2019, has attracted 500 players. A Minor League Cricket team called the Seattle Thunderbolts, backed by tech investors, also got up and running last year.\n\nAll of these teams and programs would use the Marymoor Cricket Community Park, a multi-purpose facility that could also host professional cricket events, including Major League Cricket, U.S. National Team and potential World Cup and other major international matches.\n\n“I share the vision Major League Cricket has for the launch of a world-class T20 cricket league and the potential for the United States to become one of the leading cricket nations in the world,” Somasegar said in a statement. “I am delighted to be part of a dynamic group of investors who will help the sport reach that level through an unprecedented commitment of resources by MLC to developing the sport.”\n\nOther investors include: Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, founding partners at Milliways Ventures and Rocketship VC; Sanjay Govil, founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions and CEO, Zyter; Anurag Jain, managing partner of Perot Jain, LP, chairman of Access Healthcare; Ross Perot Jr., chairman, The Perot Group; Tanweer Ahmed, CEO, PAK Foods, CEO, OUR Energy and owner of Prairie View Cricket Complex; and the Baheti Family, owners of YASH Technologies."

        "title": "The T20 World Cup In 2024 Will Give A Huge Fillip To Cricket In The US: MLC's Tom Dunmore",
        "date": "",
        "body": "The first edition of Major League Cricket (MLC), a six-franchise T20 tournament in the US, is into its last mile, and there have been a few sell-outs already, says Tom Dunmore, the vice president of marketing, MLC. America might be a baseball country, he says, but there’s no reason why cricket can’t be slowly injected into its landscape, especially because newer audiences are willing to look beyond the traditional favourites. The country also has a history with the game—the first ever international cricket match was played between the US and Canada, in 1844, a good 33 years before the first Test match was played between England and Australia. MLC has made a good start, but the focus in the next few years will be on finetuning the platform and building a new audience, Dunmore tells Forbes India in an interview. Edited excerpts:\n\nQ. The group stage of Major League Cricket (MLC) is over. Your first thoughts on T20 cricket in America?\n\nWe’ve sold out all the seven games in North Carolina and the first few games in Dallas, although these are relatively small venues. The stadium in Dallas is 6,000-7,000 capacity, while the former is about 3,500. But I’m sure we could have sold many more tickets even if we had larger venues.\n\nBut it’s not just the numbers. The energy and the passion in the stadium, and the excitement of seeing international players in flesh, have been incredible. We’ve already got a great support base from cricket fans who’ve grown up in a cricket-loving country but now live here—that gives us a strong platform to build from. They’ve never had a domestic league to watch and follow nor prime time cricket to watch; they’ve had to watch it in the middle of the night, in keeping with the time zones of the rest of the world where cricket matches are typically played. T20 gives you the chance to take a great product to them, where you can bring superstar players from other countries along with quality domestic players. When you combine that, you’ve got something that really works.\n\nWe didn’t know for certain how this would be received, but early indications are definitely strong. We’ve had proof of concept that the existing fanbase loves it, from here it’s a question of how we build new fanbases. It’ll take time, but the US is such a big country and such a sport-mad country that even if we get a sliver of the larger population that doesn’t know cricket, it will add to what’s already the fourth or fifth-biggest cricket media market in the world anyway.\n\nQ. How has cricket grown in the US, especially at the grassroots level?\n\nIt’s grown a lot from a fairly low base over the past few years. A lot of new academies have sprung up, there are about 20 affiliated major league cricket academies around the country now. We have our minor league system, which is a development or pathway league of sorts; it has 26 teams in it from 20 cities around the country, playing around 100-150 matches round the year. The minor league’s great for the future of the sport. The major league, as great as it is, is a short tournament; we need high quality cricket through the year to give development opportunities to players and enable communities to watch the sport. And that’s what the minor league does.\n\nAlso read: A T20 cricket league has taken off in the US. Wait, what?\n\nQ. America itself has a lot of popular sports. There’s Major League Baseball, NBA, NFL. Soccer superstar Lionel Messi has recently joined MLS, so that will have a lot of eyeballs. How can you get Americans to watch cricket?\n\nIt’s all about introducing it and finding the right audiences that are primed to be interested in it. I think the younger baseball fans are a great audience for cricket; they already like a bat and ball sport, albeit cricket’s a little different. You see US sports fans embracing newer sports than ever before, be it F1 or soccer. It’s not like the old days where they were just fans of the big four sports.\n\nIt’s about explaining the sport as well and we have to do some fundamental work there. That’s a great project for us for years 2,3 and 4. This year, it’s about getting the platform right and reaching out to the core audience; then we can really look to expand to other audiences in future.\n\nI think if we get people out to watch a cricket match, they’re going to love it. We all know how exciting a T20 match can be, and now we’re building stadiums and producing it well so you see it in the right way. It’s all a matter of giving people a taste and then build it on from there.\n\nQ. A lot of spectators of cricket in the US are expats from the subcontinent and the Caribbean islands. How can cricket be taken beyond these two constituencies?\n\nBy testing different audiences. We do some work with influencers, like Jomboy, who’s a baseball influencer, based out of New York. We’ve done cricket-baseball crossover content with him. Plus, it’s about creating good experiences in the stadium, and making it attractive for people to go and see the matches. There’s a high bar for sports in the US, and the fact that we are able to bring the best players really helps. We’re also doing marketing activations with local sports teams like NFL’s Dallas Cowboys and baseball team Texas Rangers. The media outreach is important too, to get on the news and sports coverage. But it'll take time, we want to build audiences brick by brick. The T20 World Cup is coming to the US [co-hosted by the West Indies] next year. It’s going to be massive, because Americans know how important a World Cup is. That, I feel, will break through to a mainstream audience.\n\nQ. Multiple T20 leagues have mushroomed across the world. How does MLC stand out from being just another T20 league?\n\nWe’re different in a lot of ways, first being we are building cricket in a non-traditional market. Unlike the newly launched SA20, the domestic T20 league in South Africa, we are a new market. We’re also building infrastructure for the sport in the US. Most other T20 leagues operate with existing infrastructure—The Hundred is playing in all the big Test match grounds in England, same in South Africa. In our case, we are building stadiums, academies, coaches, domestic players. We’re investing millions of dollars into creating what you need to have a T20 league at all. We are really going bottom-up instead of top-down.\n\nAlso read: From handball to panja, why sports leagues are taking off in India\n\nQ. What are some of the lessons to learn from the IPL, when it comes to scaling the game?\n\nThe IPL is on another planet compared to everyone else in cricket. But, it’s ironic really, how they’ve Americanised cricket—the music on the ground, the experience, we didn’t have all that in cricket before the IPL. And we are bringing it back to America. The way the teams are such strong brands, how the players have transformed into stars, we want to see that in the US. We do have some of the same players, and some of the IPL brands too. But we want our own teams that don’t have IPL brands to develop alongside them. So, while there is a lot to learn from the IPL, we need a slightly different approach given we have to develop the sport as well.\n\nQ. The first season is drawing to a close, with the MLC final on Sunday. What are the post-season plans?\n\nTo keep the momentum going and build on it. It can be done through social and digital content and through more activation, building connections for the minor league that will start right after. And then, we’re heading into the next year, which is huge since the US will co-host the T20 World Cup along with the second season of the MLC. That’s a lot to prepare for, and we want to work along with the ICC to help promote the sport in the US.\n\nOne of my most abiding memories of the past 10 days is the first time we saw a big six. The crowd got on their feet and cheered and waved flags, and it felt like you were watching cricket in any cricket-loving country. To have that in an American stadium is pretty cool. Every time I see that, I’m happy we’ve built this and, hopefully, we can deliver more of these moments to fans for years to come."

If that happens, it would be a far cry from an epochal event in American history that took place exactly 250 years ago -- the Boston Tea Party. It's here, and during the American Revolution, that Americans actively pursued an identity of their own, separate from their colonisers. In doing that, they rejected everything that was quintessentially British, and replaced it with alternatives of a new, modern world. Think coffee instead of tea. Baseball, instead of cricket."

        "body": "American Cricket Enterprises agrees upon historic lease with Grand Prairie to redevelop 5,400-seat stadium AirHogs Stadium for cricket, opening early 2022\n\nRepurposed Venue will host Major League and Minor League Cricket and act as a major hub and High Performance Center for USA Cricket\n\nGRAND PRAIRIE, TX – Major League Cricket (MLC) has received approval from the City of Grand Prairie on a long-term lease agreement to begin an extensive redevelopment of AirHogs Stadium as the organization’s first major cricket stadium in the United States. The parent company of MLC, American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) — in cooperation with USA Cricket, the national governing body for cricket in the United States — has retained the internationally renowned design firm HKS to repurpose and design what will be a world-class stadium for cricket in the United States.\n\nOne of the best sports performance facilities in minor league baseball during its previous life as the home of the Texas AirHogs, the soon-to-be renamed stadium will now become a dedicated world-class cricketing facility. The redevelopment of the venue is scheduled to take place throughout 2021 before playing host to the Texas MLC franchise that is planned to launch in 2022, as well as a base for the USA Cricket National team and a premier High Performance Center.\n\n“As the first Major League Cricket stadium in the United States, Grand Prairie represents a seminal moment for the sport in America, and we are incredibly excited to partner with the City of Grand Prairie to bring Major League Cricket to Dallas,” said Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders of ACE and MLC. “Grand Prairie’s centralized location in the U.S. and the thriving Texas cricketing community, allied with the quality of the facility, made it the perfect site for us and we are certain that this is the beginning of a fruitful long-term partnership with the City that will bring much success.”\n\nThe City of Grand Prairie is an ideal location for a premier cricket stadium in Texas, with its strong cricket fan base and demographics in surrounding areas, favorable time zone for broadcast in major international cricket markets, and Dallas-Fort Worth’s pedigree for major sports teams and stadiums. The new cricket stadium will see the existing baseball diamond converted to an international size and quality cricket field capable of hosting major international competitions, a number of training nets and batting lanes added, as well as two additional outside turf fields that will be used for training and by the affiliated MLC academies. Upon completion, it will be the most extensive fully-dedicated cricket facility in the United States.\n\nThe venue will also be a centerpiece of USA Cricket’s efforts to bring major international events to the United States, including regional International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup and T20 World Cup Qualifiers for Men and Women, Cricket World Cup League 2 series, and International Series against local rivals Canada and the West Indies, as well as other contemporary nations. The stadium will also be a featured aspect of USA Cricket’s efforts to bring the ICC T20 World Cup and other major events to the United States by 2031, in a process that is ongoing as part of a joint bid with Cricket West Indies.\n\n“We are very excited about this opportunity to bring cricket to Texas by converting our minor league baseball stadium,” said Grand Prairie Mayor Ron Jensen. “Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world behind soccer, with a large and growing audience in the states. We look forward to an exciting future with our partners.”\n\nThe redeveloped stadium is slated to be ready for cricket in Spring 2022, but will serve as a key High Performance center for the USA Cricket Men’s and Women’s National Teams and other key youth and zonal cricket squads during the interim. The Men’s National Team is currently ranked 19th in the world, having gained One Day International status for the first time in 2019. The USA Women’s National Team will be attempting to qualify for the ICC Women’s World Cup for the first time next year, having advanced to the global qualifier in 2019.\n\n“In association with our partners at ACE, we now have a world-class facility to develop our domestic talent and help us fulfill the goals we announced in our Foundational Plan,” said Paraag Marathe, USA Cricket Chairman. “The successful development of a cricket-dedicated stadium has long been a priority for us, and it is a significant stride forward for the growth of cricket in America. We also look forward to bringing international cricket events, and the crowds that go with them, to our new stadium, and to help introduce the sport to a broader audience.”\n\nUSA Cricket has recently undergone a significant transformation that includes the release of the organization’s first Foundational Plan with a vision to establish cricket as a leading sport in the USA and become a full member of the International Cricket Council by 2030. Cricket is the world’s second-most popular sport in terms of global viewership, attracting billions of viewers worldwide with a significant, growing American fanbase. USA Cricket counts more than 150,000 regular players across the country, with roughly 20 million fans and more than 4 million regular viewers of cricket.\n\nHonored by Ballpark Digest as the Best New Ballpark in 2008 following its inaugural season, AirHogs Stadium served as the home of the Texas AirHogs of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball for 12 years. The stadium, located conveniently between Arlington and Dallas, is adjacent to Lone Star Park horse racing track and The Theater at Grand Prairie, currently seats a capacity of 5,445 and features 13 luxury suites and ample space for improved amenities to enhance the experience of fans and cricketers alike. The stadium will be repurposed to be completely dedicated for cricket, with an increase in the seating capacity planned to accommodate more than 8,000 spectators with additional and upgraded hospitality features.\n\nAlong with the changing demographics of the Dallas region that have made the area a prime location for the grassroots development of cricket, the sport has seen recent progress domestically at the professional level. Following a player draft in August this year, Minor League Cricket (MiLC) successfully staged a series of exhibition matches over five weeks, the largest national cricket competition in U.S. history. The best amateur cricketers in the U.S. combined with 36 first-class and international players to play 51 competitive and entertaining T20 matches across 17 venues involving 18 of the 24 MiLC franchises with 312 drafted players competing in at least one match. ACE is preparing to launch its full inaugural MiLC T20 cricket season in May 2021, with MLC expected to start its competition in 2022.\n\nMajor League Cricket, which is exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, represents the most ambitious and transformational venture ever undertaken in the American cricket landscape. Focused on staging the highest quality T20 cricket for U.S. cricket fans, MLC will feature top international cricketers from around the globe, and provide a stage for domestic cricketers to showcase their talents to a global audience.\n\nAs the ICC’s member body for the United States, USA Cricket selected MLC as its exclusive partner for the development of a professional T20 cricket league. As exemplified by this establishment of AirHogs Stadium as a High Performance Training Center for USA Cricket, MLC provides support for both the USA’s Men’s and Women’s teams, with the goal of elevating them to the highest level of international competition.\n\nThe founders of MLC have been deeply involved with cricket in the U.S. for years, particularly with the establishment of the U.S. as a major broadcast market for the sport. MLC is co-founded by the founders of Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America and the principals of The Times of India Group, India’s largest media conglomerate. MLC is also backed by a prominent and diverse group of investors from across the U.S."

        "title": "Can Major League Cricket Hit It Out Of The Ballpark In America?",
        "date": "Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Major League Cricket has arrived in Texas. The big question is whether the sport can catch on in the land of opportunity. Once upon a time in America, cricket was the national game. It was also the location of the sport’s very first international match. That may sound like a Ripley's Believe it or Not! fact, but ‘New York, New York’ is where it all started.\n\nThe USA and Canada played that historic game in front of 10,000 spectators at NYC’s Bloomingdale Park in 1844. It may be some time before cricket crowds are packed to the rafters in America again. This is not the MLB. Or Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium, a converted baseball venue, hosts the opening match of the MLC between the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders in front of a capacity 7,200 crowd on Thursday. The 19-match tournament runs to the end of July and will also use North Carolina’s Church Street Park with a capacity currently at 3,500.\n\nThe faster-paced T20 games have been turned into popular franchises in Pakistan, Australia, the Caribbean and England. The big shot of them all, the Indian Premier League, recently become the most-watched digital sports event globally. The IPL is a multi-million dollar machine, generating over $15m broadcasting fees per match, and coming second only to the NFL as the richest league in the world.\n\nThe cash cricket cow that is the IPL has seen big funding from American investors, including the likes of Silver Lake Partners, TPG Capital and KKR KKR and Co. The format of three-hour games filled with huge hits, world-class talent from all over the globe, pitchside entertainment and premium technology in impressive stadia makes this a very desirable product to replicate. Major League Cricket has the finances. It now needs the optics, facilities and audience.\n\nKolkata Knight Riders, owned by Bollywood superstar, Shah Rukh Khan, was the first IPL franchise to invest in the MLC. They have taken a stake in the LA team as well as committing to a brand-new cricket site in Southern California. The idea is for all six teams to have their own stadiums in the next three to five years. “Our investment in MLC in America is based on our belief in the exciting future of cricket in the U.S.A and is well aligned to our strategy of establishing Knight Riders as a global brand in T20 cricket,\" said Khan.\n\nThree other IPL franchises have followed suit with the Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, and Delhi Capitals anchoring the Texas, New York and Seattle teams respectively. Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has teamed up to provide similar services to Washington Freedom. The league has also been sanctioned officially by the International Cricket Council. This is a serious moonshot.\n\nWith an estimated 30 million cricket fans in the USA, bolstered by South Asian and Caribbean immigrants, there is an existing community to capture. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft MSFT and a part-owner of the Seattle Sounders franchise in Major League Soccer, is one of the leading investors in the initial outlay of $120m into the MLC.\n\nBroadcasters include Willow TV and Viacom18 in India. “Our six teams feature T20 players who fans in India love to watch, and they (Viacom) are the right partner to showcase sports broadcasts in the world’s largest cricket market,” said Vijay Srinivasan , co-Founder of the MLC. The Indian subcontinent holds all the cards when it comes to cricket fanatics.\n\nThere is enough global quality on show too. Sri Lanka's Wanindu Hasaranga is one of the world’s best T20 all-rounders. Mitchell Marsh hit a swashbuckling century for Australia with huge sixes in the Headingley Ashes Test match. Pakistan’s Haris Rauf, West Indian Sunil Narine and England’s big-hitting Jason Roy are also among the stars aiming to drive home the entertainment ticket to the masses.\n\nRoy cancelled the incremental contract with his country for what could be a sum of between £150-200k (up to $260m) for just over two weeks’ work across the pond. If players see the dollar signs more than strict loyalty to their nation, then the MLC might be doing something right. It’s worth noting that the founders insist they are not trying to tread on anyone’s toes. The carrot is being dangled though.\n\nIn 2024, the USA are due to co-host the flagship ICC T20 World Cup tournament alongside the West Indies which opens the door to an even bigger audience. Recent reports hinted that the vital infrastructure in the country was not ready. However, the ICC confirmed that there are no plans to shift the venue to England as reported. The task now is for the United States to put together a team that is competitive in the next 12 months and keep developing the quality environment that such events demand.\n\nThe development of Minor League Cricket in 2021 has been important in encouraging homegrown stars. The next two and a half weeks will provide a perfect platform for exposure. If Chris Eubanks can come out of nowhere, then who knows which latent talent can rise to the surface.\n\nThe field of dreams has arrived but without Kevin Costner and no baseball bat. “Don’t find customers for your products, find products for your customers,” said American author Seth Godin. That model may be about to be strongly tested as cricket looks for a rebirth Stateside."

Length delivery on middle and leg stump that seems to hold in the surface just a touch and also straightens. du Plessis, looking to work to leg, closes his bat face early and gets a leading edge that flies towards Brevis at backward point. He times his jump to perfection and hands MINY the breakthrough they were after!. 12 / 1\n\n2.4 to MJ Santner , edged and taken! Boult has two in the powerplay! Back of a length delivery outside off that leaves the batter very late. Santner, without any foot movement, goes fishing at it and feathers it through to Pooran, who does the rest. TSK in some early trouble!. 18 / 2\n\n16.1 to DP Conway , Conway perishes too! Back of a length on off stump. Conway, feeling the pressure of the scoring rate, has a hack at it. Seems to be a tad early on the stroke, though, and he clinks it straight to Brevis at deep mid wicket. TSK keep losing wickets and momentum!. 115 / 5\n\n18.6 to CP Savage , leg stump out of the ground! Another knuckle-ball that pitches on off stump and keeps coming back in with the angle. Savage, after his exploits previous ball, tries to be funky and looks for the scoop. Gets no bat on it, though, and the ball flattens leg stump!. 144 / 7\n\n5.2 to C Chetty , Chetty bites the dust! Back of a length outside off and this seems to zip through and bounce that little bit extra. Chetty comes down the track again and looks to go over the off side ring. But because he is a smidgen late on the stroke, he can only nick it through to Pooran, who accepts the offering gleefully!. 34 / 3\n\n19.3 to DA Miller , taken brilliantly at long on! Darted in just outside off. Miller looks to go downtown but this is a tad wider than he would have wanted. Tries to fetch it but all he manages is to drag it towards long on. Wiese runs in from the fence, dives forward and completes a superb catch!. 155 / 8\n\n19.4 to G Coetzee , two in two for David! Back of a length delivery on middle and leg. Coetzee tries to tonk it into tomorrow but is in no shape to play that stroke. The ball skews up off the outside edge and Taylor gobbles up a fairly regulation chance at backward point!. 155 / 9"

Read it now.\n\nYour Email address\n\nThe News\n\nBig-league cricket has officially come to the U.S.\n\nThe inaugural season of Major League Cricket launches in Grand Prairie, Texas on Thursday, with teams representing six U.S. cities competing in tournament-style competition.\n\nAnd while India’s most popular sport expands in the U.S., Major League Baseball is looking to make its own inroads in India.\n\nAD\n\nWe’ve curated the most insightful analysis about the global growth of both sports.\n\nInsights\n\nMLB, the professional organization overseeing America’s pastime, is hiring to create a new Indian video series to “grow baseball and the MLB brand in India,” Front Office Sports reported. Job postings classify India as an “exciting growth market” for baseball.\n\nThe league is also promoting the ascent of Arjun Nimmala, a 17-year-old whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from India. He grew up playing some cricket before pivoting to baseball, and was just picked in the first round of the MLB draft. No first-generation Indian American has ever been drafted that high in any of the four major sports in the U.S.\n\nAs for Major League Cricket, the sport’s global governing body is “desperate to lift its sport’s profile in America,” The Guardian reported, noting that the league has firm financial support from prominent Indian American tech executives like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and a solid roster of players. But at times, “it can feel difficult to imagine how this experiment might succeed,” The Guardian notes. “Talking to Americans about cricket is usually about as easy as explaining climate change to a ferret.”\n\nA past iteration of professional cricket tried to get off the ground in the U.S. years ago, but unlike this one, it didn’t have the backing of national or international governing bodies, The Times of India noted. The coach of New York’s new cricket team said the sport will speak to ”the American sporting psyche where the players are a lot more physical, fitter, stronger, hit the ball further.”"

        "body": "DALLAS: All-rounder Mohammad Mohsin bowled a magnificent spell of 4/8 as the Texas Super Kings registered a 69-run victory over Los Angeles Knight Riders in the first match of the Major League Cricket tournament at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas on Thursday. The Super Kings put up 181/6 in their 20 overs before bundling the Knight Riders out for 112 in just 14 overs.\n\nThe Knight Riders found it difficult to get their innings going right from the start as speedster Rusty Theron dismissed Martin Guptill and Rilee Rossouw in the very first over. Calvin Savage and Gerald Coetzee backed up Theron's effort by sending Nitish Kumar and Unmukt Chand back to the pavilion in quick succession. The Knight Riders were reeling at 20/4 in the fourth over.\n\nAndre Russell gave a sliver of hope to the Knight Riders when he smashed a six and two fours off Coetzee in the fourth over, however, he kept losing partners at the other end. Captain Sunil Narine and Russell put the Knight Riders at a decent position at 103/5 at the end of the eleventh over, however, Mohsin got the Super Kings back into the game with two wickets in the twelfth over.\n\nDwayne Bravo put the final nail in the coffin when he dismissed Russell for 55 runs off 34 balls in the thirteenth over with the Knight Riders 73 runs away from the target. Mohsin wrapped up the match in the very next over with the wickets of Adam Zampa and Lockie Ferguson.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Los Angeles Knight Riders won the toss and put Texas Super Kings into bat. Devon Conway got the Texas Super Kings off to a flying start with three boundaries in the first over, however, Lockie Ferguson dismissed Captain Faf du Plessis on the first delivery of the second over. The Knight Riders' bowlers continued to shine as Ali Khan sent Lahiru Milantha packing for 17 runs off 14 balls in the sixth over.\n\nBut thereafter, the two experienced campaigners, Devon Conway and David Miller changed the momentum of the match through a 77-run partnership in just 49 balls. Conway took charge against fast bowler Corné Dry and struck him for two boundaries in the seventh over before Miller also struck two fours off Dry in the ninth over. Miller found a maximum in each of the tenth, eleventh and thirteenth overs and took the Super Kings to 113/2 in 13 overs.\n\nThe Texas franchise kept losing wickets at regular intervals after Conway fell to Adam Zampa in the fourteenth over for a fantastic innings of 55 runs from 37 balls. However, Mitchell Santner and Dwayne Bravo smashed four sixes between them in the last few overs to help the Super Kings post a formidable total of 181/6 in their 20 overs."

        "date": "Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "It was an obvious place to launch a sporting moonshot – a cricket league that can survive and thrive in America.\n\nLast week, Space Center Houston hosted a reveal of next-generation spacesuits for a lunar mission. A few days later its main hall was crowded with cricketers wearing gaudy baseball caps in the colours of their new teams as the latest attempt to bring professional cricket to the US held its domestic player draft.\n\nWith the first overall pick, the Seattle Orcas of Major League Cricket (MLC) selected an all-rounder: 30-year-old Harmeet Singh, captain of the minor-league Seattle Thunderbolts and a member of the India squad that won the 2012 under-19 World Cup.\n\nFour years after taking three wickets for England in their World Cup final win over New Zealand, Liam Plunkett will bowl for the San Francisco Unicorns. A domestic player because he lives in the Philadelphia area with his American wife, the 37-year-old was chosen in the second round.\n\nBeaming in a suit jacket, white trainers and an orange Unicorns cap, Plunkett posed for the cameras next to the Mission Mars exhibit, a bulbous silvery spacecraft dangling from the ceiling above his head as pop music and a variegated array of glowing lights lent the event a novel atmosphere: sports meets disco meets STEM.\n\nNot quite the Long Room at Lord’s. But the inaugural MLC season will boast international talent worthy of the sport’s most hallowed venues. Among Plunkett’s fellow Unicorns are the former New Zealand all-rounder, Corey Anderson, the former Australia limited overs captain, Aaron Finch, and his 2021 Men’s T20 World Cup-winning teammate, Marcus Stoinis.\n\nAnother Australian, the in-form Mitch Marsh, will play for Seattle, as will the 30-year-old former South Africa captain, Quinton de Kock. Wanindu Hasaranga, a 25-year-old Sri Lankan international, and the South African fast bowler, Anrich Nortje, have signed for the Washington Freedom. More well-known overseas names are set to be announced in the coming days to line up alongside the 54 US-based players drafted on Sunday.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee, a boosterish Houston congresswoman, opened the ceremony. “Are we ready for cricket?” she inquired. “Are we ready?”\n\nIt’s an open question. American cricket has long been tramelled by turbulent governance and earlier attempts at professional leagues struggled to get off the launch pad. But there are strong reasons for optimism, not least the wealth and experience of the MLC investors.\n\nAn initial $120m is funding the project, which has some influential backers from the technology and media sectors and India, including Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, who is part of the Seattle ownership group. Owners of Indian Premier League (IPL) clubs have stakes in four of the six MLC teams.\n\nThe season will take the T20 format and will be played from 13-30 July – helpful timing to attract stars during the southern hemisphere offseason, though problematic for players in England. Joining the Orcas, Freedom and Unicorns are the Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York and the Texas Super Kings. The locations are strategic: cities with large South Asian communities that offer ready-made fanbases, with organisers recognising that it will take years to attract significant numbers of spectators who have never played or watched cricket.\n\n“We’re trying to build infrastructure, a minor league, a major league, get the national team competitive all at the same time. There’s an awful lot going on and it’s going to take time, but I think our growth trajectory can be quick once … people see, hey this is a great product, this is going to work. I think we’ll then get a second influx of momentum,” said Justin Geale, the MLC tournament director.\n\nMLC has spent years building a developmental framework to nourish domestic players and improved grounds and training facilities are springing up. The pre-draft combine took place at a six-field complex near Houston that opened in 2019.\n\nPlunkett is convinced there is latent talent in the US. “I [visited] maybe 13 years ago and I always thought to myself I had one of the better arms in cricket in England, and I just went to the local park in Philadelphia with a few of my friends at college or who worked in Home Depot, and I think all four of them had a better arm than me,” he grinned.\n\nThe US will host the 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup, jointly with the West Indies, though Plunkett denied he is chasing a spot on the American roster next year. “I’m happy finishing international cricket with England at the World Cup,” he said.\n\nMLC has the financial heft to offer salaries comparable with competitions such as Australia’s Big Bash, England’s and Wales’s The Hundred and the ILT20 in the United Arab Emirates – the salary cap per team is understood to be slightly above $1.1m. “We can get the best players in the world,” said Geale, a former IPL director of operations. “We can put out a world-class product from day one.”\n\nRusty Theron, a former South Africa international who played for Sussex in 2012, moved to the US in 2015. The 37-year-old was drafted by the new Texas team after playing minor league cricket in the San Francisco Bay area. “We’ve got a pathway set up where if you’re a good player we’ve got eyeballs on you, somewhere you can actually make a living as a cricketer, and something to aspire to,” he said. “As far as professionals go there’s no shortage of people that are interested. After all, it’s the USA and that in itself is a brand, something that sells itself quite easily.”\n\nSan Francisco have joined forces with Cricket Victoria while Washington have partnered with Cricket New South Wales, tapping into the Australian association’s expertise in coaching and operations while giving it a foothold in America. “We’re moving with the cricket landscape, really,” said Michael Klinger, head of male elite cricket at Cricket NSW. “Cricket’s changing around the world, the T20 franchise leagues are popping up and this is one that could be very big in this market and we want to be part of it.”\n\nHowever, all the matches are expected to be staged in North Carolina and the Dallas area, where MLC has spent $19m refashioning the erstwhile abode of the defunct Texas AirHogs minor league baseball team into a 7,200-capacity cricket ground. That points to perhaps the league’s biggest challenge: the dearth of suitable venues.\n\n“We need to get to a home and away model, so they need somewhere to play in their home cities,” Geale said. “In two to three years we’d like to see some serious traction and have a lot of those facilities in place.” That is a tall order given the difficulties of building new stadiums in crowded and expensive cities. Intriguingly, the Freedom and George Mason University are shaping plans for a hybrid cricket/baseball field on the outskirts of Washington."

        "body": "“Imagine,” my friend said, in an attempt to contextualize the ocean of flags, whistles, drums, and overall frenzy surrounding us last night in Grand Prairie, “that you’re way into basketball—and your country just got basketball.”\n\nOn a basic level, he was describing the biggest selling point of Major League Cricket, whose attempt to bring the world’s second-most popular sport to the United States—and North Texas, in particular—is the subject of my feature in our July issue. North Texas has one of the largest South Asian populations in the United States, and that community is cricket-rabid, with no significant outlet on this side of the Atlantic aside from the Caribbean. What happens when you provide one?\n\nThe answer, as we saw last night, is a sellout crowd of more than 7,000 people losing their minds for the better part of four hours as the Texas Super Kings (our new local team) took on Mumbai Indians New York. Our D Magazine contingent—Tim Rogers, Matt Goodman, Brian Reinhart, and yours truly—pegged the crowd to be well over 90 percent South Asian, which is in the ballpark of what every source I spoke with told me represents the national fan base. Per an MLC press release from over the weekend, six matches in the first 10 days reached capacity. A bunch of rich guys are building a cricket league with actual infrastructure, and now everyone is showing up.\n\nBut it would also be reductive, and unfair, to describe MLC’s appeal in relation to one group of people. Not everyone in the crowd was South Asian, after all. Take, for instance, the four of us. Tim, Matt, and Brian knew next to nothing about cricket going into last night. (Brian was there for the concessions, which he’ll write about soon enough.) Prior to reporting this story, I was in the same boat—and when it comes to understanding the action itself, still kinda sorta am. And we had a hell of a Monday night.\n\nSome of this is due to the sport itself, which is faster, more vibrant, and, frankly, more dangerous than most people realize. But the experience in the stands is what stood out to me. It would be naïve to characterize any pro sporting event as organic—those that are tend to do poorly in the profit margins—but it was largely a blissful escape from the prepackaging that contaminates American sports. There were no promotions or sponsorships jammed into each break in the action. The video board stuck to stats and the occasional, too-infrequent replay. The PA announcer chimed in for names, lineups, key points in the match … and that’s about it. It won’t last forever—sports are big business—but in the here and now, MLC seems to understand the allure of a great sport and a great atmosphere.\n\nThose two things transcend demographics. They’re why sports remain our most durable culturally unifying force. Yes, the South Asians who understand cricket and its rhythms set the tone of the crowd last night. But it didn’t take long for Matt to start blasting his canary-yellow Super Kings whistle. Or Tim to make excuses for his new sports hero, Texas captain Faf du Plessis, after an error at bat. Or all four of us to nod in approval at hard-earned runs and clap our hands at fours (when the ball rolls to the wall) and spring to our feet as fireworks exploded with each six (cricket’s version of a home run).\n\nThis was a blending of East and West, old fans and new. Concession stands offered samosas and burgers. The DJ blasted Hindi music and Kesha. Seasoned cricket watchers in the row ahead of us periodically turned to gently explain nuances of the game that we were too green to see.\n\nAnd so we learned. We laughed. We celebrated. We chowed down. And thanks to a new (to us) sport put on by a new (to everyone) league, we had a wonderful night.\n\nBy the way, the Super Kings won 154-137."

The star batter has joined as the third Australian in the dugout of Washington Freedom which already has some of the talented players and coaching personnel in their squad.\n\nThe southpaw will be playing alongside Steve Smith, who was signed by Washington Freedom earlier this year. Furthermore, Ricky Ponting is the head coach of the franchise, which makes it a trinity of Aussies in the same squad. In addition to it, Washington have some of the most talented players in the world in their lineup.\n\nEarlier this year, they announced two of their bowlers, Akeal Hosein and Marco Jansen, as their retained players from the 2023 season, while they recently announced the signing of New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra. As a unit, Freedom already seem to have a compact core of players.\n\nAlso read: MLC 2024: Rashid, Klaasen, Pooran, Boult among 23 overseas retentions\n\nTravis Head's busy schedule\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Test series against the West Indies, Head opted out of the T20I series against New Zealand, which provided him a much-needed break from the game. The Australian cricketer has been a part of the Australian team in the ODI World Cup 2023 and did not get enough rest after winning the major tournament.\n\nHe was also a part of the T20I series against India and the Test series against Pakistan and the West Indies. The southpaw took a bit of rest before taking part in the ongoing IPL 2024. He is currently playing for SRH in IPL 2023 and will continue to have a busy schedule. Head will be one of the key players for Australia in the T20 Wolrd Cup 2024.\n\nAfter the major tournament, Australia are scheduled to play England in September. To make use of the free time in July and August, Head has decided to take part in the MLC 2024. He is likely to be busy from September 2024 to January 2025 given the high-profile series against teams like England and India."

Using his feet, Russell reached the pitch of the ball, and powered it over the boundary line: replays showed that the ball had landed on a young kid’s head, with his guardian hugging him and rubbing his head.\n\nAfter the game, the young fan, still being administered an ice pack, was called up to meet Russell. The Jamaican all-rounder greeted the fan with a smile, hugging him first and then chatting with him. He proceeded to sign some memorabilia for the fan, and also posed for photos.\n\nDespite Russell’s big-hitting, LAKR ended up on the losing side, with a combined batting effort by Freedom ensuring a six-wicket win and knocking the Knight Riders out of the competition.\n\nWatch Russell greet the fan here:"

        "body": "0.3 to FH Allen , Haring in and bangs it on a length, gets a little bit of seam movement and induces a false shot! He heaves it over the bowler's head but finds Faf du Plessis at long-on who hangs onto it brilliantly. A crucial scalp for TSK! Fabulous start for Super Kings. Bold of Sams to persist with full-length and he lured him into a big shot. 4 / 1\n\n19.4 to C Bishnoi , Oh that is a blinder! Rank full wide of off, swats it and Santner at deep point ran in and took a fantastic catch. Plucked his hand out, caught the ball and made sure it doesn't pop out of his hands. They are checking if it's a no ball, a few inches under waist height so that's all-right.. 165 / 8\n\n3.4 to MP Stoinis , Tantalizingly in the air, has a stab at that and is playing from his body. He cleverly takes the pace off and he absolutely flummoxed. Once again it is Faf du Plessis in action at cover; he kept his eyes on the ball and reverse cupped it expertly under the sun. That's a good breakthrough because he is a dangerous customer. 31 / 2\n\n15.2 to CJ Anderson , Gone, zingers are alight! Round the wicket. Good length and it zings back from the angle, tries a big mow and ends up chopping it back onto the stumps. The bowlers have mostly kept the batters on a leash here on this slow pitch. Credit to the bowlers for reading the pitch well and mixing it up nicely. 116 / 5\n\n18.2 to AJ Finch , Round the wicket, angling across, it's a full toss which sounds the death rattle. Leg-cutter which was dipping towards off stump, he went for the pull and got deceived the slowness of the delivery. That's a crucial scalp. He could have done significant damage in these last two overs but he is taken out of the equation. 151 / 6\n\n18.4 to Tajinder Singh , This looks a brilliant short but it is not far enough Excellent comeback from Coetzee who was struggling in his last spell. Befuddles him with a slower one on a full length, invites him to have a crack at it and he obliges. Hits him pretty well but didn't get the elevation. Once again it is Faf du Plessis who takes his third catch of the evening. 153 / 7\n\n10.2 to MS Wade , Spanked but not entirely mighty! Just couldn't get underneath it and Miller, who is as safe as a house, catches it superbly at deep midwicket, making sure he doesn't loses his balance because he was quite close to the rope. This was tossed a touch fuller and wide of off, he went for the slog sweep but couldn't get enough elevation and lost his shape. 85 / 3\n\n12.5 to Shadab Khan , Stupendous catch at long-off as another one bites the dust! Tossed up fuller outside leg as Shadab was stepping away from the leg stump and he smartly followed him up, he still commits to the shot but cannot time it well and didn't control his bat. 104 / 4\n\n0.2 to F du Plessis , A touch shorter and gets that big banna inswing pegging him back and thumping his front pad as they all appeal like excited students in a class but the umpire thinks otherwise. They have sent it for another opinion. Okay, so on the replay, it is clearly away from the bat, and it's three reds on the screen as they all celebrate and scream in joy. That's a fantastic review, got the line right and gets his man. Huge breakthrough!. 6 / 1\n\n1.2 to C Chetty , Edged and taken! Right on money, fast and furious gets a breakthrough. Bangs it on a shorter length on 143 kph, that's a lovely nagging line, with a hint of movement, draws him forward and it takes the outside edge through his dangling bat. Wade makes no mistake. TSK in a spot of bother. 11 / 2\n\n17.3 to Milind Kumar , Is there another twist in the tale? Fires in a heat-seeking yorker on off and uproots the off stump as he tries to scythe that away to point but misses. Vicious fist-pump and goes airborne but what an innings! He has turned the game on its head. 162 / 6"

        "body": "Chasing a challenging score of 178, the opening pair of Finn Allen and Matthew Wade propelled the San Francisco Unicorns to a rollicking start. The left-handed Wade started the assault by cutting loose in the second over before the Kiwi batter Allen teed off in the following over and thumped the opposition skipper Wayne Parnell for 22 runs. That over included 4 fours and 1 maximum. The right-handed Allen threw his wicket away after a blistering knock of 28(10) owing to a lethargic effort in running between the wickets.\n\nWade continued his onslaught by smashing Imad Wasim for three consecutive boundaries in the 5th over before the left-arm spinner took retribution and cleaned up the Aussie batter for 28(16). Despite losing two wickets, the early pyrotechnics by Wade and Allen helped the Unicorns orchestrate 67 runs off the powerplay. The Australian duo of Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch failed to capitalize on the laid foundation and slowed down the innings. Both the batters fall victim to left-arm spin and the two wickets in quick succession gathered momentum for the Orcas.\n\nThe San Francisco innings went haywire as they lost wickets in clusters in the middle overs. Shadab Khan played a valiant knock of 37(23) and tried to drag matter till the end but the Unicorns kept losing wickets at regular intervals and lower-order collapse did not help their cause. Cameron Gannon was the pick of the bowlers for the Orcas and attained exceptional figures of 4/23. Imad Wasim and Andrew Tye also extracted a couple of wickets.\n\nEarlier in the day, after winning the coin flip and elected to bat first, Seattle Orcas were off to a ruinous start as Haris Rauf extracted the massive wicket of Quinton de Kock 7(6) in the second over itself by uprooting the southpaw with a scorcher of a delivery. Both Nauman Anwar and Shehan Jayasuriya negated the new ball well following the early departure of de Kock and helped Orcas to aggregate 53 runs off the powerplay. Anwar and Jayasuriya added 44 runs for the 2nd wicket before Liam Plunkett outsmarted the former with some extra bounce."

        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) has received approval from the City of Grand Prairie on a long-term lease agreement to begin an extensive redevelopment of AirHogs Stadium as the organization’s first major cricket stadium in the United States.\n\nThe parent company of MLC, American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) -- in cooperation with USA Cricket, the national governing body for cricket in the United States -- has retained the internationally renowned design firm HKS to repurpose and design what will be a world-class stadium for cricket in the United States.\n\nOne of the best sports performance facilities in minor league baseball during its previous life as the home of the Texas AirHogs, the soon-to-be renamed stadium will now become a dedicated world-class cricketing facility. The redevelopment of the venue is scheduled to take place throughout 2021 before playing host to the Texas MLC franchise that is planned to launch in 2022, as well as a base for the USA Cricket National team and a premier High Performance Center.\n\n“As the first Major League Cricket stadium in the United States, Grand Prairie represents a seminal moment for the sport in America, and we are incredibly excited to partner with the City of Grand Prairie to bring Major League Cricket to Dallas,” said Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders of ACE and MLC. “Grand Prairie’s centralized location in the U.S. and the thriving Texas cricketing community, allied with the quality of the facility, made it the perfect site for us and we are certain that this is the beginning of a fruitful long-term partnership with the City that will bring much success.”\n\nThe City of Grand Prairie is an ideal location for a premier cricket stadium in Texas, with its strong cricket fan base and demographics in surrounding areas, favorable time zone for broadcast in major international cricket markets, and Dallas-Fort Worth’s pedigree for major sports teams and stadiums. The new cricket stadium will see the existing baseball diamond converted to an international size and quality cricket field capable of hosting major international competitions, a number of training nets and batting lanes added, as well as two additional outside turf fields that will be used for training and by the affiliated MLC academies. Upon completion, it will be the most extensive fully-dedicated cricket facility in the United States.\n\nThe venue will also be a centerpiece of USA Cricket’s efforts to bring major international events to the United States, including regional International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup and T20 World Cup Qualifiers for Men and Women, Cricket World Cup League 2 series, and International Series against local rivals Canada and the West Indies, as well as other contemporary nations. The stadium will also be a featured aspect of USA Cricket’s efforts to bring the ICC T20 World Cup and other major events to the United States by 2031, in a process that is ongoing as part of a joint bid with Cricket West Indies.\n\n“We are very excited about this opportunity to bring cricket to Texas by converting our minor league baseball stadium,” said Grand Prairie Mayor Ron Jensen. “Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world behind soccer, with a large and growing audience in the states. We look forward to an exciting future with our partners.”\n\nThe redeveloped stadium is slated to be ready for cricket in Spring 2022, but will serve as a key High Performance center for the USA Cricket Men’s and Women’s National Teams and other key youth and zonal cricket squads during the interim. The Men’s National Team is currently ranked 19th in the world, having gained One Day International status for the first time in 2019. The USA Women’s National Team will be attempting to qualify for the ICC Women’s World Cup for the first time next year, having advanced to the global qualifier in 2019.\n\n“In association with our partners at ACE, we now have a world-class facility to develop our domestic talent and help us fulfill the goals we announced in our Foundational Plan,” said Paraag Marathe, USA Cricket Chairman. “The successful development of a cricket-dedicated stadium has long been a priority for us, and it is a significant stride forward for the growth of cricket in America. We also look forward to bringing international cricket events, and the crowds that go with them, to our new stadium, and to help introduce the sport to a broader audience.”\n\nUSA Cricket has recently undergone a significant transformation that includes the release of the organization’s first Foundational Plan with a vision to establish cricket as a leading sport in the USA and become a full member of the International Cricket Council by 2030. Cricket is the world’s second-most popular sport in terms of global viewership, attracting billions of viewers worldwide with a significant, growing American fanbase. USA Cricket counts more than 150,000 regular players across the country, with roughly 20 million fans and more than 4 million regular viewers of cricket.\n\nHonored by Ballpark Digest as the Best New Ballpark in 2008 following its inaugural season, AirHogs Stadium served as the home of the Texas AirHogs of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball for 12 years. The stadium, located conveniently between Arlington and Dallas, is adjacent to Lone Star Park horse racing track and The Theater at Grand Prairie, currently seats a capacity of 5,445 and features 13 luxury suites and ample space for improved amenities to enhance the experience of fans and cricketers alike. The stadium will be repurposed to be completely dedicated for cricket, with an increase in the seating capacity planned to accommodate more than 8,000 spectators with additional and upgraded hospitality features.\n\nAlong with the changing demographics of the Dallas region that have made the area a prime location for the grassroots development of cricket, the sport has seen recent progress domestically at the professional level. Following a player draft in August this year, Minor League Cricket (MiLC) successfully staged a series of exhibition matches over five weeks, the largest national cricket competition in U.S. history. The best amateur cricketers in the U.S. combined with 36 first-class and international players to play 51 competitive and entertaining T20 matches across 17 venues involving 18 of the 24 MiLC franchises with 312 drafted players competing in at least one match. ACE is preparing to launch its full inaugural MiLC T20 cricket season in May 2021, with MLC expected to start its competition in 2022.\n\nMajor League Cricket, which is exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, represents the most ambitious and transformational venture ever undertaken in the American cricket landscape. Focused on staging the highest quality T20 cricket for U.S. cricket fans, MLC will feature top international cricketers from around the globe, and provide a stage for domestic cricketers to showcase their talents to a global audience.\n\nAs the ICC’s member body for the United States, USA Cricket selected MLC as its exclusive partner for the development of a professional T20 cricket league. As exemplified by this establishment of AirHogs Stadium as a High Performance Training Center for USA Cricket, MLC provides support for both the USA’s Men’s and Women’s teams, with the goal of elevating them to the highest level of international competition.\n\nThe founders of MLC have been deeply involved with cricket in the U.S. for years, particularly with the establishment of the U.S. as a major broadcast market for the sport. MLC is co-founded by the founders of Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America and the principals of The Times of India Group, India’s largest media conglomerate. MLC is also backed by a prominent and diverse group of investors from across the U.S."

        "date": "Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Sam Hogben | 3:17pm BST 31 July 2023\n\nMajor League Cricket launched in the United States in 2023 in a longstanding attempt to bring the game to American audiences. Ownership groups from the Indian Premier League have brought their respective franchises to the USA, including the Super Kings, Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, and Delhi Capitals, while two of the other franchises have support from Australian states New South Wales and Cricket Victoria.\n\nAs a result, many stars of the white-ball format such as England’s World Cup winners Jason Roy and Liam Plunkett along with international stars Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, and Kagiso Rabada are plying their trade in the new league.\n\nThe immediate attraction of star power has resulted in a competitive series, and perhaps more importantly sell-out crowds for the six teams and venues in Major League Cricket situated across the United States.\n\nThe question now for Major League Cricket and all involved is whether the competition is sustainable in an already jam-packed schedule for both domestic and international cricket.\n\nAppeal\n\nTaking cricket into the mainstream of US audiences has always been a dream of the International Cricket Council, but there has never been the right demand. Challenging the entrenched hierarchy of baseball as America’s summer sport is always going to be a daunting prospect and it won’t change any time soon.\n\nAudiences have responded to Major League Cricket, selling out the six stadia over a three-week period. The news will please the ownership groups of all six franchises, but there will be the desire to see the league expand in the coming years if it can sustain its success and appeal to American fans. It has been popular too among the leading betting sites in the United States, who have all carried MLC odds for individual games and futures markets.\n\nSo, there is plenty of evidence that there is a foundation for Major League Cricket to build on.\n\nThe inaugural Major League Cricket season had only 19 games in its schedule, including four playoff games. Compared to over major T20 leagues in the world, the competition is a small one, which could well play into its hands given the schedule.\n\nAmerican fans may appreciate the novelty of a short sharp competition that allows them to enjoy a niche sport for a couple of weeks before tuning back into baseball. The problem Major League Cricket will have is to determine whether these fans are enjoying the novelty for one season or whether it can be sustained over a period of time.\n\nOther T20 leagues around the world have benefitted from being situated in countries where cricket already has a strong following, notably South Africa where SA20 was launched in 2023. The structure of the league is similar to Major League Cricket, where the franchises were also owned by the leading IPL outfits. SA20 enjoyed a fruitful first season, but they too will have the issue of sustainability over a long period of time, including one of the key issues that could make or break Major League Cricket.\n\nAvailability\n\nThe primary issue that Major League Cricket faces is its competition. It fits into the international cricket schedule at the height of the English summer, meaning that none of the major England stars will be available unless a gap can be made.\n\nRoy decided to make the move to Major League Cricket by sacrificing his England incremental contract and turning his back on the opportunity to play for his county Surrey for their Vitality Blast campaign. Roy is an extreme case and has made his intentions clear that he is a white-ball specialist, but the revitalisation of the England Test team under Ben Stokes may result in players opting to make themselves available for all red-ball matches in the future.\n\nThe likes of Stokes, Harry Brook, Jonny Bairstow, and Mark Wood who specialise in both red-ball and white-ball formats will not turn their backs on their lucrative England contracts. So, there could be a problem attracting the top-tier English talent and whichever teams are touring England during their summer months, which coincide with the Major League Cricket season. Unless the campaign can be shifted to a more amenable period those players will not be available.\n\nEven the IPL has had its issues securing the best English talent, despite offering huge salaries.\n\nThere are other issues too. The Global T20 Canada is played at the same time, which steered a portion of players away from MLC north of the border, notably England opener Alex Hales among others from New Zealand such as Tim Southee and Colin de Grandhomme and West Indies’ superstar Chris Gayle.\n\nMajor League Cricket will need to open up lines of communication to prevent a crossover, allowing both competitions to take advantage of the top players that are available in the summer months.\n\nContracts\n\nRoy’s example of tearing up his England contract to play in Major League Cricket is an interesting precedent, which may begin to rear its head across the sport. Mumbai Indians have already locked up players to represent their teams across all T20 competitions such as Dewald Brevis.\n\nRajasthan Royals are looking to follow suit by tempting Jos Buttler with a four-year contract that would secure the England white-ball captain’s services for the IPL and their other franchises Paarl Royals in SA20 and the Barbados Royals in the Caribbean Premier League. Jofra Archer is another player who has reportedly been offered a lucrative deal by Mumbai Indians.\n\nIf players were to accept those contracts it would threaten to tear up the fabric of the game as countries would be forced to ask permission of franchises to allow their players to represent their nations. It is undoubtedly an exciting time in cricket, and although there have only been a few players to take the plunge and accept franchise-only deals at the moment, there may come a time when it spreads throughout the game.\n\nNew Zealand’s Trent Boult opted to take a step back from international cricket, while numerous other players are considering rationing their availability for all formats amid the packed schedule.\n\nThese contracts could work in the favour of Major League Cricket because of the six teams’ affiliation with their IPL partners. If Archer were to sign with the Indians, he would be available to play for MI New York instead of featuring for England in their summer. It would be at Archer’s discretion what team to choose.\n\nWe’re just entering the infancy of these contracts, but outside of the big three nations of India, Australia, and England, international teams are struggling to match the financial packages that can be provided to players from franchise cricket in all corners of the globe.\n\nThe MLC and other leagues could soon be flooded with superstars from around the world that will focus on T20 competitions rather than all formats.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nMajor League Cricket has arrived at a pivotal moment in the history of the game, and its development could well dictate the future of how players are handled between the franchise revolution and the status quo of the international game.\n\nHowever, there are issues that need to be addressed, notably whether MLC is just a novelty for an American audience and interest could quickly wane after a couple of seasons. It may also need to work on its place in the cricketing calendar to avoid other major competitions, especially in England, where luring stars could further boost its profile.\n\nThe first season has been a success commercially and it has the chance to be a building block for a permanent place in the US sporting zeitgeist."

You sort of um and ah about that time of the year about where you're going to be and whether you take the time off, whether you play the Hundred or what you might do and I think just having those couple of Aussies there and I think the opportunity to be a part of something really big in MLC and grow something is really exciting as well.\"\n\nMaxwell joins Head, Smith, Adam Zampa (Los Angeles Knight Riders), Spencer Johnson (Knight Riders), Tim David (MI New York), Matt Short (San Franciso Unicorns) and Jake Fraser-McGurk (San Franciso Unicorns) as confirmed Australian signings for the second season of MLC, with more expected to join for the tournament which starts immediately after the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies ends on June 29.\n\nMeanwhile, Maxwell has moved to clarify his decision to ask to be omitted from RCB's line-up from the last IPL match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Maxwell explained that it had nothing to do with needing to take an extended break from the tournament. He simply felt like he was not in the best XI and wanted to take any tough conversations away from captain Faf du Plessis and coach Andy Flower by asking to be dropped.\n\n\"I was pretty low on confidence,\" Maxwell said. \"I had a good couple of net sessions and just went out to the ground and felt really tentative. I wasn't able to really commit to my game plans and just felt like if I had kept playing and playing that role, I don't think the results would change too much.\n\n2:51\n\nGlenn Maxwell to join Washington Freedom in MLC\n\n\"So I just went to Faf and said, look, I think we need to try someone else in my position and had the same conversation with Andy Flower, the coach, and to me it was a bit of a no-brainer. I think it sort of saves the tough conversation they might have to have about dropping me.\n\n\"I felt really at peace with it. Obviously, I'm frustrated that I wasn't able to get the results I would have liked but comfortable in the fact that I know I feel like I've made the right decision for the team and it's certainly not like I'm taking an extended break away from the game.\n\n\"I just think it's a better opportunity for someone else to have a crack at my position. I know I'm an important part of this side but at the moment I'm not playing well enough to I suppose warrant a spot.\"\n\nMaxwell revealed he is unlikely to come back in for the next game, against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, given he is battling a minor hip injury. He said he understands he has to bide his time to get another opportunity.\n\n\"I've actually got a little bit of a hip strain so I've got a few more days off and during recovery,\" Maxwell said. \"So I've got a little period here where I'm still training, still trying to get myself right. If there is a spot that becomes available, I'll obviously put my hand up and take it\n\n\"It's not one of those things where I've set a date that I'll be out for three games then I'll come back whenever I'm ready. That's that's not how it works. I haven't been at a level that's good enough to warrant a spot on the side this year.\"\n\nAlex Malcolm is an associate editor at ESPNcricinfo"

        "body": "Topline\n\nA New York cricket team owned by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's family defeated a squad partly controlled by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Sunday in the inaugural championship match for Major League Cricket, the latest attempt to bring the hugely popular international sport into the U.S. mainstream.\n\nKey Facts\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nWe estimate Ambani’s net worth to be $91 billion, making him the 15th richest person in the world and the richest man in India, ahead of Gautam Adani ($54.9 billion). Nadella’s shares of Microsoft were worth about $261 million as of Monday.\n\nKey Background\n\nIn late 2022, league officials announced the inaugural season of Major League Cricket after years of delays caused by construction setbacks on the league’s main stadium in Texas, where half the matches were played. The season lasted three weeks and featured six teams playing Twenty20 cricket, a shortened version of the sport. The teams, representing cities and states across the country—New York, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Texas, San Francisco and Los Angeles—played all their matches between two stadiums in Texas and North Carolina. USA Cricket, which has officially sanctioned the league, has said that Major League Cricket is part of its official strategy to turn cricket, which is already incredibly popular in India, Pakistan and Australia, into a mainstream U.S. sport and to become a full member of the International Cricket Council by 2030. It’s not the first effort to create a cricket market in the U.S. though. 2004 saw the first attempt at professional cricket in the U.S. with startup league Pro Cricket. That league folded after just one season. In 2015, a series of exhibition matches were hosted across the U.S. by legendary Australian and Indian cricketers Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar. Meanwhile, this new league comes ahead of the 2024 Twenty20 World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the U.S. and the West Indies. Outside of the United States, cricket is a massively popular—and lucrative—sport: Five-year broadcasting rights to the Indian Premier League sold for $6.2 billion last year, a higher per-game value than any other sports league aside from the NFL.\n\nTangent\n\nNita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani and the face of the family’s cricket enterprises, brought a whole couch to the stadium to watch Sunday’s match in comfort, ESPN journalist Peter Della Penna reported.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"Just look at the atmosphere here,” Nita Ambani told reporters. “It looks like a festival of cricket. I think MLC is a momentous step in the development of cricket in this region.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nMajor League Cricket Starts With A Bang In America Despite Obstacles (Forbes)\n\nBroadcast Rights For India’s Top Cricket League Sell For $6.2 Billion, Value Per Game Second Only To NFL (Forbes)"

Matches are set to return to Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, TX and at additional venues to be named later.\n\nMLC’s debut season in 2023 transformed the landscape of American cricket, bringing world class domestic T20 action to the United States for the first time with a majority of the matches played in front of sold-out crowds in Texas and North Carolina. Dozens of the world’s best cricketers competed alongside the nation’s top domestic talent across 19 matches, with MI New York claiming the inaugural crown, defeating the Seattle Orcas in the championship final."

        "date": "Wed Jul 26 10:13:30 2023",
        "body": "West Indian all-rounder and MI New York captain Kieron Pollard smashed a 110 metre long six, the biggest of the Major League Cricket (MLC), on Tuesday, July 25.\n\nThe massive hit came on the second ball of the 12th over against the Seattle Orcas. Right-arm pacer Cameron Gannon from over-the-wicket dropped a slower-one short outside the off-stump. It didn't bounce much, allowing Pollard to clear his front leg and clear the ground over mid-wicket.\n\nHere's a video of the six:\n\n10 balls later, the all-rounder mistimed a short delivery from spinner Harmeet Singh for an easy catch to Gannon at deep mid-wicket. He went back after a brisk 18-ball 34, which included three sixes and a boundary.\n\nThe innings added to Nicholas Pooran's 68 (34) and took MI's score to 194/8. It was a par score but the Orcas chased it down in 19.2 overs courtesy of a stunning 44-ball 110 from Heinrich Klaasen, including a 26-run over vs Rashid Khan.\n\nKieron Pollard's injury a potentially massive blow for MI New York\n\nUnfortunately for MI, Kieron Pollard suffered an injury in the second innings. While trying to save a straight shot from Klaasen against David Wiese's bowling at long-off, he fell right on his shoulder and called for the physio immediately. He walked back to the dugout in pain with his arm tucked into the t-shirt.\n\nIt could be a decisive blow for the side ahead of their knock-out Eliminator clash against Washington Freedom on Thursday in Dallas. The skipper hasn't scored a lot of runs in the competition but has the fourth-best strike rate of 166.15.\n\nPollard plays an important middle-order role which, if he's ruled out, would be difficult to replicate. MI will likely go with Dewald Brevis and Pooran, and Tim David will be asked to finish the innings as well as hold the middle order together."

But here to see two or three hours of unabashed fun, I'm a convert.\"\n\nCricket's only previous appearance at the Olympics was during the 1900 Games in Paris, where a team from Great Britain defeated France in a lone match.\n\n\"This is a great day for the Olympic movement, a great day for India, a great day for the United States and a great day for cricket fans everywhere,\" said Garcetti.\n\n\"I think it will ignite a new generation of cricket players and cricket fans... We think that this format is perfect for the Olympics, perfect for cricket, and no better place to launch than here, in the middle of cricket madness.\"\n\nThe Indian Premier League, featuring the game's global stars, has cemented India's position as the unquestioned economic driving force of the sport, thanks to legions of fans and lucrative broadcasting deals in a nation where the game is almost a religion.\n\nMonday's vote also took place while India stages the men's 50-over Cricket World Cup.\n\nMajor League Cricket, a professional Twenty20 League, launched in the United States in July, with the US a co-host of next year's men's T20 World Cup together with territories in the West Indies.\n\n\"By the time of the Olympics, not only Major League Cricket will be significant in the US, we'll have the facilities and the fanbase,\" said Garcetti.\n\nOn a more serious note, Garcetti voiced his support for the concept of the Olympic truce, amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"The tradition of the Olympics was the Olympic truce,\" he said.\n\n\"In ancient times, everybody put down their weapons to have sports unite us... So we hope that this inspires people that peace is better than war, that participating together is better than conflict.\""

        "body": "The inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket competition has got underway in the United States of America, with the first leg of the matches being played out at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\n\nA lot of impressive performances have already been on display, with some of them quite frankly taking our breath away. The standard of the game has been phenomenal.\n\nMI New York and Texas Super Kings have dominated the competition so far, with the likes of Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom coming into their own as well. Los Angeles Knight Riders, a subsidiary of Kolkata Knight Riders of the Indian Premier League, have had perhaps the worst showing so far, losing both the matches that they have played and that too by big margins.\n\nA lot of local American players have caught our eye, too. Since this tournament is, in a way, meant to provide them with a pathway and help them develop, we have compiled a listicle of three such names who have impressed us the most.\n\nHere are three local players to watch out for in Major League Cricket 2023.\n\n#3. Ali Khan (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nExpress fast bowler Ali Khan, who turns out for the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the competition, is one of the brightest stars of American cricket. Known to possess decent pace, Khan can swing the ball too, often getting it to angle across the right-handers who come across him.\n\nKhan can also bowl yorkers consistently, and this is what makes him different from others of his ilk. He has picked up four wickets so far in the competition, having bagged a couple of wickets each in the two games that the Knight Riders have played so far, against the Texas Super Kings and MI New York.\n\nDespite his team doing poorly in this competition, Khan has done well individually. He has been seen hurrying the batters for pace, and with the prized scalp of Nicholas Pooran in his pocket, his confidence is only bound to soar further.\n\n#2. Shayan Jahangir (MI New York)\n\nMI New York have had a poor start to this competition so far, winning one and losing two. Although he was not a part of their first game against San Francisco, Shayan Jahangir found his way into the team for the next two matches.\n\nHe failed to perform against Los Angeles Knight Riders but scored a fabulous 41 against Texas Super Kings. Born in Karachi, Pakistan, Jahangir is the regular wicketkeeper for the USA national team but plays as a batter in MLC, given the presence of Nicholas Pooran behind the stumps.\n\nA calm presence at the crease, Jahangir did well in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifiers held recently in Zimbabwe, with a brilliant century against Nepal being the icing on the cake. His ability to use his feet against the spinners has often come in handy in MLC.\n\nIf Jahangir continues in this vein of form, MI New York's batting worries might be solved very soon.\n\n#1. Mohammad Mohsin (Texas Super Kings)\n\nOne of the biggest stories of the inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket competition is that of Mohammad Mohsin.\n\nLeft out of the initial draft, Mohsin was disappointed but managed to keep a smile on his face. He was picked up by the Texas Super Kings in the wildcard round just seven days before the tournament began, and now has seven wickets to his name! He is also the leading wicket-taker of the tournament at the time of writing.\n\nMohsin starred in his debut game itself, picking up 4/8 against Los Angeles Knight Riders, and followed it up with 1/28 against Washington Freedom and 2/36 against MI New York. His captain Faf du Plessis is extremely pleased with him, owing to the wide variety of tricks the leg-spinner has in his bag.\n\nBorn in Peshawar, Pakistan, Mohsin has played seven first-class matches and an equal number of List A games. Watching a leggie is always easy on the eye, and that is especially the case with Mohsin. With impeccable control over his length and drift, he can go on to achieve a lot of big things."

The interesting part will be to see the local boys.\"\n\nThe first season of MLS 2023 will see a total of 110 players, representing six teams.

        "body": "Major League Cricket: Silicon Valley and Bollywood’s grand plan to make America fall in love with T20\n\nPeople don’t tend to associate the game of cricket with the United States.\n\nThe world’s second most popular sport has an estimated global following of 2.5bn, yet has struggled to attract an audience in the US, where American football, baseball, and basketball dominate the live sport broadcasting schedule.\n\nBut a group of investors that includes chief executives of tech giants and a Bollywood film star are seeking to change that with the launch of Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nThe Twenty20 cricket competition, scheduled to launch in 2022, will feature six franchises. Dallas and Los Angeles have already been confirmed as team locations.\n\nMLC’s organisers hope that the competition can repeat the success of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which has rapidly become one of the world’s most-viewed sports leagues.\n\nThe competition’s launch is also a key part of USA Cricket’s foundational plan, which aims to grow cricket’s American following and improve the quality of the national team.\n\nA 24-team sister competition, called Minor League Cricket, begins next spring and will serve as a pipeline to MLC.\n\nUSA Cricket is targeting full membership of the International Cricket Council by 2030.\n\nThe governing body is also set to spend at least $10m to renovate the AirHogs Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nThe 6,000-seat facility will become a cricket-exclusive venue, hosting Dallas’s MLC franchise and functioning as a high-performance centre for young American players.\n\n“We have been encouraged by the great progress that we have been able to make across a number of different areas despite the obvious challenges of these times,” said Paraag Marathe, the chairman of USA Cricket, earlier this year. We anticipate that our growth will accelerate now that the organisational direction has been very clearly set.”\n\nWho are the key figures behind it?\n\nSome influential US business leaders are cricket lovers who want to increase the sport’s American following.\n\nMost notable among them is Satya Nadella, Microsoft chief executive and lifelong cricket fan.\n\nUnder Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft is expanding its main campus with the Richmond, Washington site building a world-class cricket pitch.\n\n“Technology and cricket go together perfectly,” says cricketer turned journalist Simon Hughes. “Many CEOs of US tech giants are of South Asian origin and love cricket.”\n\nHughes co-wrote his latest book, A New Innings, with Manoj Badale, owner of the IPL’s Rajasthan Royals.\n\nIt argues that Indian-American tech executives like Nadella, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Pepsi’s Indra Nooyi will support the sport’s planned expansion to the US.\n\nIndian actor Shah Rukh Khan, labelled by some media as the “King of Bollywood”, is also investing in MLC.\n\nKhan is a co-owner of the IPL’s Kolkata Knight Riders, and will own the MLC’s Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n“Undoubtedly, other IPL and privately-owned franchises may invest in MLC,” says Hughes.\n\nCan Major League Cricket succeed?\n\nDespite significant investment from businessmen such as Nadella and Khan, MLC will have to overcome several major obstacles.\n\n“The Big Four leagues [NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL] effectively crowd out sports from the likes of media and sponsorship markets,” says Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport business at Emlyon Business School.\n\n“Sports such as cricket, in the short- to medium-term, typically find it extremely difficult to overcome such barriers.”\n\nHowever, MLC’s founders are confident that their new initiative can succeed where other attempts to establish cricket in the US, such as Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar’s 2015 Cricket All-Stars series, have failed.\n\nMajor League Soccer, which has achieved sustainable growth through engagement with Hispanic communities, offers some lessons, says Chadwick.\n\n“US consumers are predisposed towards spending on sport, and there are several diasporas in the US that may already be engaged with cricket,” Chadwick says.\n\nBy some estimates, there may be 6m Americans of Indian and South Asian origin, many already cricket fans.\n\nMLC has already signed a broadcasting contract with Willow TV, a pay television sports channel. It airs overseas cricket events and targets much of its advertising to Americans of Indian or South Asian origin.\n\nThe success of North America’s first T20 League, the Global T20 Canada, will also encourage MLC’s founders.\n\nThe Canadian tournament marked itself out by attracting high-profile international players including Chris Gayle, Shahid Afridi and Steve Smith.\n\nHughes says that the lessons from the IPL, Global T20 Canada, and other franchise T20 competitions are straightforward.\n\n“Get the best players, and make sure they’re shared out so all teams are roughly equal in terms of ability.”\n\nIf MLC successfully follows that formula, cricket could finally gain a foothold in the world’s largest sport economy."

This is the second title for the MI family in the year 2023, as MI Women’s team also won the inaugural WPL trophy.\n\nMajor League Cricket is a great initiative to promote the sport in the biggest sports market i.e., the United States of America. After the Minor League Cricket, which was the foundation of the Major League Cricket, MLC was successfully launched on the 14th of July 2023, with six teams participating in the inaugural season.\n\nOut of the six teams, three had parent franchises in the Indian Premier League. Texas Super Kings is owned by the Super Kings family, MI New York from the Mumbai Indians family and LA Knight Riders is owned by the Knight Riders group. The other three teams were; Washington Freedom, Seattle Orcas, and San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nFaf Du Plessis led Texas, Kieron Pollard captained the MI New York, Aaron Finch led the San Francisco Unicorns, Sunil Narine led the LA Knight Riders, Wayne Parnell was leading the Seatle Orcas, and Moises Henriques led the Washington Freedom Team.\n\nWinners of the inaugural Major League Cricket\n\nMI New York, led by Kieron Pollard, were nowhere near the playoffs after losing two of their first three games. It was the last game of the league stage that changed the fortunes of the team.\n\nWell, one can say that Nicholas Pooran changed the fortunes of the team. He was just impeccable throughout the tournament. His golden run continued in MLC as well. Sadly, his team won’t be featuring in the upcoming World Cup despite his exceptional performances.\n\nIt was a tough road for MINY to get to the final when they struggled to make it to the playoffs. But MI did what MI does, and we saw a whole different team in the knockout stage. Dewald Brevis and Tim David were no less as Brevis helped MI New York perform well in the Playoffs. And then Nicky Phammered the Seattle Orcas in the Final with his knock of 137 runs off just 55 deliveries.\n\nPooran became the highest scorer of the tournament, with 388 runs in just eight innings averaging nearly 65. And Trent Boult, who was also a part of this team, became the highest wicket-taker of the season with 22 wickets in just eight innings.\n\nApart from these guys, MINY also had Rashid Khan, David Wiese, Kagiso Rabada and a few local players. Despite this much strength and experience in the team, MINY suffered earlier in the tournament but eventually had a fairytale ending with the Caribbean brothers adding one more trophy to the MI cabinet.\n\nThe success of the MLC 2023\n\nThe inaugural season of the Major League Cricket was a successful stint as players from all over the world took part. Players like Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Dwayne Bravo, Devon Conway and many more were a part of this new and delightful league.\n\nEven Glenn Maxwell believes that MLC will attract the cricketers more as they will get to travel to the USA once a year.\n\nFor the local players, like Cameron Gannon, who was named the domestic player of the tournament, it was a great opportunity to have international players in their dressing room with highly experienced support staff.\n\nMajor League Cricket will not just take the US cricket forward but also help them grow and get recognition at the international level, and it will be no surprise if we see the USA cricket team in the next World Cup."

        "date": "Sun Mar 24 06:52:29 2024",
        "body": "It’s been a year since the inaugural MLC Draft was presented to great fanfare at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. The theme of space travel, the final frontier, teased the imagination of cricket enthusiasts who have long wondered what a mainstream American breakthrough would do for cricket. Fans and curious observers could follow the 2023 MLC Domestic Draft as it unfurled live on YouTube, and some even traveled hundreds of miles to bear witness in-person.\n\nThis year’s draft took place remotely and was not broadcast or streamed live. Instead, Major League Cricket provided a recap video on their MLC Network YouTube channel as a “premiere.” Hosts Nikhil Uttamchandani and Aaman Patel knowledgeably summarized Tuesday night’s events, interviewed players, and announced a few star overseas names.\n\nBut in spite of the downgrade in hype, budget, and allegory, the 2024 MLC Domestic Draft is a unique, strategic, and creative thing to dissect.\n\nA new draft format\n\nBy the end of Thursday night’s 2024 Major League Cricket Domestic Player Draft and Season Preview, the names and draft positions of 20 domestic cricketers were announced, 13 of which would be joining MLC squads for the very first time.\n\nMLC’s sophomore domestic draft class will join 33 previously retained domestics across Major League Cricket’s six teams making 53 domestics so far, with a supplemental draft scheduled for June 16 to fill out the squads.\n\nWhile last year’s domestic draft was a simple snake draft, teams would be heading into this year’s draft with varying purse and team sizes. This imbalance necessitated an entirely new approach full of new wrinkles and challenges.\n\nWith ten pay levels replacing “rounds,” decreasing incrementally from $75,000 to $10,000, plus a $5,000 U23 round, teams would have the option to draft, in turn, at each pay level, provided they had the purse available to do so. Teams could also draft twice at each pay level, if they still had the available purse, and only after other teams had a fair opportunity.\n\nHeading into the draft, Texas Super Kings had the largest purse available at $150,000 with a maximum of three slots to fill. This meant that TSK could take one player at the $75,000 round, another at the next highest pay level of $65,000, and still have $10,000 left over to take a final player. Or, if they felt that the market was in their favor and their target would still be available at the next pay level, they could take two players at $65,000 and a third at $20,000. The potential combinations would be limited by their remaining purse after each pick, the available draft pool at each level, and their anticipation of other teams’ priorities and purse.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Seattle had only $60,000 available. The Orcas could draft as many as four players, but wouldn’t be able to pick a player until the $35,000 pay level at the earliest.\n\nSeattle’s small purse could be seen as validation of a job well done by the franchise in 2023. Four of Seattle’s retained domestics were drafted in the first four rounds, and their fifth retained player was drafted in the sixth. “We were very pleased with our Season One draft picks,” Seattle Co-Owner Sanjay Parthasarathy told Emerging Cricket. “Our domestic players’ consistent performances throughout the first season gave us the opportunity to retain them and to focus on specific roles for Season Two.”\n\nThe draft order was determined by the reverse finish in last year’s table, meaning LA Knight Riders ($115k purse) would pick first, followed by SF Unicorns ($110k), Washington Freedom ($70k), Texas Super Kings ($150k), Seattle Orcas ($60k) and MI New York ($95k).\n\nBy the time the dust had settled, $570,000 would be spent in total.\n\nEarly surprises\n\nThe first “round,” the $75,000 pay level, would kick off with only four teams holding enough purse to make a bid. LA Knight Riders had the first opportunity, and surprised many by selecting Adithya Ganesh. The 32 year old veteran from Tamil Nadu featured as a wicketkeeper for East Bay Blazers in 2023 in the West division of Minor League Cricket. In 2023, Ganesh’s Impact Per Innings of 4.8 ranked 25th among batters with more than five innings in MiLC. This rating essentially put Ganesh at 4.8 runs better than replacement (league average) per game in 2023.\n\nLAKR’s pick of Ganesh left San Francisco with the opportunity to draft their prime target, Hassan Khan.\n\n“Looking ahead at the draft, we had Khan as our number one ranked player and not having that first selection, there’s always a fear of the things you can’t control,” San Francisco’s Graham Manou explained. “Despite having had a look at what other teams needed philosophically, we thought ‘You know Khan might not be available being the best player in the draft’ and it’s something that, at most drafts, generally you do tend to see the best players go.”\n\n“We were obviously a little bit surprised, but extremely happy to be able to secure Khan at that price point. We saw a lot of value in what he could potentially bring for the group, particularly with the international players that we are currently compiling.”\n\nIt only took a short stint in Minor League Cricket in 2023 for Khan to establish himself as a legitimate star. Khan’s 182 strike rate and 220 runs in 5 innings was enough to lead all batters in Impact Per Game at 20.1, more than two runs better than league runner up Corey Anderson’s 17.8. With the ball, Khan was equally impressive, ranking eighth in Impact Per Over, saving his team 2.39 runs per over better than the league average thanks to 11 wickets at a 4.89 economy. That he put up these figures in the Central division, the toughest in Minor League Cricket, was enough to plant him firmly as the favorite to be selected first overall. And as a left arm orthodox all rounder, Khan fulfilled a glaring need for the Unicorns, who took only 6 wickets with spin in 2023.\n\nBut the selection of their top rated cricketer didn’t come without a high cost. Spending $75,000 on a single slot left the Unicorns with only $35,000 for their final three players. And with their U23 slot currently occupied by Sanjay Krishnamurthy, each remaining player would cost at least $10,000. This reduced the Unicorns to spectators until at least the $15,000 round.\n\nTexas delivered the next big surprise, taking young wicket keeper Joshua Tromp as the final player in the $75,000 round. Only a few days shy of 19 years old, Joshua finally clicked at the Minor League Cricket level in 2023, after watching his twin brother Matthew get drafted in the U23 round of the 2023 MLC Draft by Seattle. With 362 runs at a 133 strike rate in a finishing role for Houston in the Central Division, Joshua’s 6.5 Impact Per Match ranked him 15th overall, just ahead of LAKR’s Nitish Kumar (6.1). Though he was fairly certain to get picked before the U23 round, few would have predicted that an 18 year old would go 3rd overall at the $75,000 pay level.\n\nLA Knight Riders, SF Unicorns, and Washington Freedom did not have the cap space to pick in the $65,000 round, leaving Texas Super Kings to make their move and draft Raj Nannan.\n\nThough his numbers during the 2023 Minor League Cricket season were a bit exaggerated, thanks to the bowling friendly wickets in the East Division, Nannan was a consistent, reliable star producer in Minor League Cricket for The Philadelphians. His 2023 MiLC Impact Per Over ranked just behind Washington Freedom and USA Cricket star Saurabh Netravalkar at -1.82, meaning he saved his team nearly two runs per over better than the league average bowler. And he batted well on those difficult wickets.\n\nNannan was the second of what would be six left arm orthodox bowlers taken in the MLC Domestic Draft in 2024, indicating that perhaps MLC franchises are taking note of what many have long considered a position of national strength.\n\nThe only other team with enough cap space to pick in the $65,000 round was MI New York.\n\nThe purses were quickly getting smaller, and every team except TSK had at least two slots left to fill. LAKR had $40k in space for up to four slots, SF had $35k for up to four slots, Washington had $70k for up to four slots, TSK had $10k for one slot, and Seattle had $60k for up to four slots. This put MINY firmly in the driver’s seat with $95k in cap space with up to five slots to fill.\n\nTeams did not have to end the draft with a full domestic roster, and could fill out their squads with the Supplemental Draft in June. However, each team had to leave the draft with their $5,000 U23 slot filled.\n\nNew York could yield their turn to pick in the $65k round in hopes of landing their man in the $60k round, or even the $50k round, without much worry that any team would spend the vast majority of their purse to pick ahead of them. Only Washington could really threaten their pick, but with four players still needed, it was unlikely that Washington would spend that much on just one player in the $50k round, and certainly not in the $60k round.\n\nNevertheless, New York shockingly opted not to test Washington at all, and selected Ruben Clinton immediately in the $65,000 round.\n\nRuben Clinton took on a compiler role for Socal Lashings in Minor League Cricket, as his team fought to stay relevant in a crowded playoff race punching slightly above their weight in the competitive West. As a result of this batting approach, Ruben’s Impact Per Match rating was exactly 0.0, making him one of two MiLC batters (along with Surf Rider and former USA Cricket all rounder Marty Kain) to finish 2023 exactly at league average production per innings.\n\nIn spite of his average production in MiLC in 2023, Clinton impressed during the 2024 Men’s T20 National Championship in Houston just before the draft, clearly catching the eye of MINY scouts when he finished his first ever USA Cricket tournament game as the Man of the Match with two wickets and 30 runs scored. Ruben ended the Nationals as the sixth leading run scorer, along with three wickets at an economy of 4.75.\n\nThe high draft position must have buoyed Clinton after he fell through the cracks with USA Cricket selectors. In spite of his top ten performance with both bat and ball, Ruben wasn’t asked to join the USA Men’s Training Squad following the National Championships.\n\nConsidering the retention of 2023 first pick Steven Taylor, Ruben gives MINY two left hand batting openers who bowl right arm finger spin. This means New York has $130,000 of their domestic purse tied up in one role.\n\nSeattle and Washington make their move\n\nTeams moved through the $60k, $50k, and $40k rounds without a player taken, as only Washington had the purse space to reasonably make a selection.\n\nAt the $35,000 round, Washington had a difficult choice to make. If they passed up their turn, Seattle could easily select one of their targets, considering that Seattle had $60k in space. But if they waited another round, they could potentially double up and still have money left over for solid contributors.\n\nSeattle, already happy with their retained domestics, could either pass on the $35k round, or ensure that they get their guy right now.\n\nSeattle’s guy turned out to be 2021 Minor League Cricket MVP and 2023 MLC and MiLC champion Hammad Azam. And the $35k round seemed like a great place to claim their first pick of the draft.\n\n“Our plan was to get three or four role players, because it’s a longer season this year,” Parthasarathy explained. “As always, we rely on a combination of data and a player’s fit with our team’s character and system. Hammad was at the top on both counts, so we were happy to get him.”\n\nWhile Hammad certainly gives Seattle variety, depth and experience, his selection left the Orcas with $25k in cap space for up to three more players. This put Seattle out of contention for the $25k and $20k rounds.\n\nAs it worked out, it also left Washington with their preferred targets still in the pool and the largest purse going at $70k.\n\nWashington would indeed spend two picks in the $25,000 round. First up, Hampshire all-rounder Ian Holland, a versatile veteran of 21 international games for USA Cricket. Holland has proved to be a key role player as the third fast bowler for USA Cricket, taking 29 wickets in 21 matches across ODI and T20i, while adding over 400 runs in 17 innings. Holland has also accumulated 68 First Class and 51 List A matches.\n\nNext, left arm orthodox spinner Amila Aponso, San Francisco’s Wild Card (supplemental) selection in 2023. A veteran of 12 international matches for Sri Lanka, Amila has starred for Atlanta Fire since 2021, currently sixth in wickets all time in Minor League Cricket with 55 in 41 innings at a 5.84 economy.\n\n“We were surprised that Ian Holland went through that low,” Washington Freedom General Manager, Michael Klinger told EC. “We could have picked him up earlier. We took a calculated risk because we only had a small amount of salary cap left. We wanted at least three, if not four, different skill sets amongst that. So we took a calculated risk that he would slip through a touch lower.”\n\n“We also obviously were making sure we kept an eye on other teams’ salary remaining once it got to those levels and the percentages were in our favor to continue, to let it go a couple more rounds. And with the rules in the draft, you’re allowed to pick up two players in the same round as long as everyone else passes and it comes back to your turn.”\n\n“Strategically, once it got to 25, we knew with 70k salary left that to spend 50k on the two main players we were after was the best way to go. So we went for 25 and 25 for Holland and Amila Aponso, who we felt was the best left arm orthodox in the draft with the most experience, and played the highest level of cricket.”\n\n“We felt getting those two in our first two draft picks was pretty much what we were after.”\n\nLAKR and SF Unicorns play it safe; MINY and Seattle bet on youth\n\nThe $20,000 round saw two fast bowlers selected. LAKR brought back Corne Dry, their fifth pick from 2023, but this time at half the cost. Corne has established himself as one of the top fast bowlers in the USA over the past three seasons for Atlanta Fire, where he’s third all time in wickets in MiLC with 72 in 42 matches. A tough rookie season in MLC kept him from being retained at a higher fee.\n\nCorne’s Atlanta rival Heath Richards, of MiLC’s Lightning, was scooped up next by MINY. Richards, injured much of 2023, finished 2022 with an Impact Per Over rating of -1.34, good enough for 28th in Minor League Cricket, after taking 14 wickets in 12 innings.\n\nThe $15,000 round was on deck, and it was time for San Francisco to rejoin the action. Coming into the round, they had a strong domestic fast bowler corps in Liam Plunkett, Carmi LeRoux and Brody Couch; talented left arm spinning all-rounders Hassan Khan and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (U23); and sensational middle order batter Corey Anderson. But among those not retained from 2023 was third round pick and batter Tajinder Singh.\n\nWhile Tajinder didn’t live up to his third round price point in 2023 (only 22 runs in 5 innings), he presented a safe option for San Francisco at the $15,000 price point.\n\n“We felt it was really important to maintain our core group of players in the Quicks, you know, they’re a valuable commodity” Manou explained. “We feel we’re pretty fortunate with those that we’ve got in Carmi, Liam, and Brody. And obviously Corey’s an outstanding and proven player and Sanjay is a fantastic young talent and individual.”\n\n“So we needed to create some space. And Tajinder was probably one of those players that we saw a lot of value in what he could potentially bring for the group, particularly with the international players that we are currently compiling. So when it got to our selection, we certainly considered the role that we felt he could play, and there are multiple roles I think that Tajinder can offer. Having him available at that point was great. A known commodity, someone that we’ve really enjoyed working with to date was a no-brainer for us and we’re really looking forward to having Tajinder back.”\n\nWith a talented batting all-rounder in Hammad Azam already in the bag for Seattle and $25k remaining in their budget, the Orcas were feeling good about their domestic squad. But rather than risk waiting through a sure to be busy $10k round, Seattle decided to take their pick at the $15k round, and then fill out the rest of the team with a U23 and a June supplemental pick.\n\nThe best available player on their board at this point was 21 year old left arm orthodox all-rounder Ali Sheikh, who had been selected in the 6th round in 2023 by LAKR but not retained. Ali continued to build his resume in Minor League Cricket in 2023, helping his Dallas Mustangs to the league title, with an Impact Per Over rating of -0.5 with the ball, and an Impact Per Match rating of 3.0 with the bat.\n\nAli famously took guard in the 10th over of 2023 MiLC Final with his team in a 41 for 4 hole and built a 56 run partnership with Nosh Kenjige to revive the innings and help the Mustangs to a 44 run victory over NJ Somerset Cavaliers to claim the league title.\n\n“We want to help develop the pool of domestic players and are committed to developing young players with long-term potential,” Parthasarathy explained. “Having said that, Ali Sheikh is a young player with substantial experience. His strike rate and batting averages are good, and compare favorably with many seasoned players. He is a wonderful fielder and has a great attitude.”\n\nHuge value in the final round\n\nHeading into the $10,000 round, LAKR, SF Unicorns, and Washington Freedom had $20k each to spend. Texas, Seattle and MINY had $10k each. This was the last chance to take a senior domestic cricketer before the U23 round in this draft. Any slots not filled by the end of this draft would have to be filled during the Supplemental Draft on June 16.\n\nAfter drafting a wicket keeper and a fast bowler, LA Knight Riders kicked off the busiest round of the draft with a left arm orthodox bowling all-rounder. Trinidad born Derone Davis, former CPL veteran with Windies U19 experience, earned a place in the draft thanks to three seasons of rock steady performances in MiLC’s East Division. Davis finished 2023 in the conversation for East Division MVP after producing a 4.4 Impact Per Match rating with the bat and a -0.51 Impact Per Over rating with the ball for perennial contenders New Jersey Stallions. On top of his competency with bat and ball, Davis seemed to make a jaw-dropping play in the field every single weekend.\n\nSan Francisco was up next. With $20k remaining and two players needed this round, the Unicorns would need to wait for Washington after making their first selection of the round. With plenty of batters and wicket keepers still available, San Francisco would settle on Karima Gore. Overlooked last season after missing the combine, Gore’s resume includes 24 games of International experience for USA Cricket, regular playing time as a part of the Leeward Islands, and a terrific record in Minor League Cricket.\n\nGore has batted more than bowled for Leeward since his last appearance with USA in 2021, but his fielding prowess is almost unmatched in the Associate cricket world. His recent form thrust him into the conversation for Major League Cricket, in spite of a wealth of left arm orthodox options across the country. Just a few days prior to the draft, Gore scored 240 runs in an innings in Antigua’s domestic two day competition. With San Francisco in possession of two left arm orthodox all rounders, Gore gives the team options at a position they’ve clearly got pegged for a domestic. And you won’t find a better option for a 12th man fielder if he fails to crack the playing eleven.\n\nWashington would indeed select in the $10,000 round, making San Francisco wait on their final pick. Lahiru Milantha, TSK’s third round selection in 2023, scored 32 runs in at a 94.11 strike rate and was dropped after two innings while TSK’s overseas keeper Devon Conway finished fourth in runs. This made Milantha an expensive redundancy, but his reputation with the gloves and proficiency as an opener in Minor League Cricket made him an appealing selection to backup star opener and keeper Andries Gous. After three seasons in MiLC, Milantha ranks 12th in runs with 1,031 runs at a 131.67 strike rate in 34 innings. Gous, should he miss games, leaves some big shoes to fill, ranking first in MiLC career runs with 1,579 at a strike rate of 137.9 in 44 innings. The selection of Milantha gives Washington the two highest drafted keepers from the 2023 draft at a bargain total price.\n\n“We were keen to get a spare keeper batter, just in case anything happened to Andries Gous, as it did last year with a calf injury at the back end of the tournament,” Klinger explained. “We’re really happy to get Lahiru Milanth, such a high quality player who’s played for his country, at quite a low (price) level. To be able to get him to play for us, he could also play as a spare batter if required as well.”\n\nWhile Washington’s domestic output in 2023 was among the best in the league, they played the entire season without a left handed batter until the seventh position. Milantha gives Washington more “freedom” to make matchups with their batting order.\n\nThe round then came back to San Francisco, who selected Jahmar Hamilton with the final pick of the draft before the U23 selections. A standout with the gloves and a basher in the late middle order, Hamilton gives the Unicorns an option for another domestic role in their team. A teammate of Karima Gore in the Leeward Islands setup, with one test and one ODI for West Indies to his name, “Pup’s” sensational keeping and explosive finishing have helped solidify Atlanta Fire as a top team in Minor League Cricket.\n\n“We feel really fortunate to have been able to secure Gore and Hamilton,” Manou told EC. “Gore certainly, in conjunction with Khan and our stable of quicks, allows us a few opportunities for how we will strategize with our international players now as we look to fill out our list there. But yeah, two extremely well credentialed cricketers and both currently in really good form.”\n\nWith no U23 needed, San Francisco had wrapped up their 2024 domestic draft, and were happy with their haul.\n\n“It’s nice to have a raft of options to fit in the XI and even Sanjay (Krishnamurthi), who’s still of rookie age, having spent some time with him out here in Australia playing against some of our local and interstate talent. We’re really buoyed by what he can offer in the future and, and possibly even this year he’s gonna fit in nicely if he does get his opportunity.”\n\n“Going back to Hamilton and Gore, again, we’re really, really excited by those two joining our group. And again, it provides some great flexibility to what we’re offering. You just never know what opportunities are around the corner, particularly with the amount of cricket that some of the players are playing with injuries and so forth there, their role and responsibility may be quite impactful as the tournament plays out.”\n\nRookie roulette\n\nThe U23 round began with only LAKR, Washington, Seattle and MINY needing to draft.\n\nLos Angeles, with last season’s U23 Bhaskar Yadram aged out, drafted first and selected Matthew Tromp, twin brother of TSK’s Joshua Tromp. After spending 2023 as Seattle’s U23, Tromp struggled a bit in Minor League Cricket, but his undeniable talent meant that he was sure to be picked up again this year.\n\nWashington, who’s U23 slot was vacated by retained 24 year old offspinner Akilesh Bodugum, picked next and took young USA Cricket leg spinner Yasir Mohammad. With six international matches behind him, Yasir is challenging for a permanent place in the USA squad. At only 21 years of age, Yasir gives Washington a player to develop for years before he ages out.\n\n“We felt he was probably the best leg spinner left in the draft,” Klinger explained. “There’s obviously a couple who are already in other teams. So we did a fair bit of research on him. He’s a confident young player, which is very important in a leg spinner.”\n\n“He’s very good in the field and gives, you know, Ricky and our captain, once that’s named, an option if they want to go with an extra spinner, or a little bit of an X factor in the team. So working with someone like Ricky Ponting and some of our overseas players that we’re going to announce in the coming months, I think he’s going to learn a heap and only going to get better and better.”\n\nTraining camps with overseas partners have been a big part of development for many of the MLC teams, particularly Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington.\n\n“Washington Freedom, in conjunction with Cricket New South Wales, ran a training camp over the BBL period last year. If we’re able to do that again, someone like Yasir to come out and train with the BBL clubs and play matches against high quality opposition is only going to help him going forward as well and help him hopefully make the USA team down the track.”\n\nSeattle surprised some when they didn’t retain 2023 U23 Matthew Tromp. With three players claimed under the age of 24 in the senior rounds, and Matthew taken first overall in the U23 round, it appeared that Seattle had taken an unnecessary risk. But the U23 pool presents a decent amount of talent left to choose from.\n\nLeft arm pacers don’t grow on trees, and Ayan Desai is a rare fruit. Leading the 2023 Socal Lashings bowling attack with 14 wickets in 10 games at an economy of 5.76, the 21 year old ranked 13th in MiLC Impact Per Over at -1.99 in 2023, which was fifth among bowlers who appeared in more than 7 games. Desai had also just been selected to represent the West Zone in the 2024 Men’s T20 National Championships.\n\nWith Desai in the fold, Seattle had ended their domestic draft. Confident with their domestic situation, and happy with their approach and preparation, Seattle will enter the June Supplemental Draft with $5,000 left to spend.\n\n“We are very fortunate to have GMR Sports, co-owners of Delhi Capitals, helping us with our team,” Parthasarathy told EC. “Their advice and relationships have helped us throughout the process.”\n\n“The domestic draft is important to us for multiple reasons,” Parthasarathy continued. “Domestic players are the future of cricket in the USA. Developing the domestic player roster is what will build USA’s national team in the long run. And of course, it’s been shown the world over that domestic players determine the success of teams in franchise tournaments.”\n\nIn 2023, MI New York selected Saideep Ganesh as their U23, but the young opener never joined the team after suffering a back injury. Wicketkeeper Slade Van Staden was flown in from South Africa to fill the role, and even played in a game. But New York did not retain Van Staden, and now picked last in the 2024 U23 round.\n\nRushil Ugarkar, the preferred U21 for the 2023 MiLC Champion Dallas Mustangs, earned his selection thanks to an immense performance in the 2023 MiLC postseason. In three Super Eights games, Ugarkar took 10 wickets at a 7.75 economy, helping Dallas into the final. Though he did not bowl in the Championship Final, his throw from the boundary to runout Adil Bhatti ended the game, officially sealing the championship for the Mustangs.\n\nUgarkar’s selection represented the end of the 2024 MLC Domestic Draft, but the June Supplemental Draft gives a second life to a few quality domestic cricketers who were left out. Any cricket played between now and then is cricket that matters for a fortunate few.\n\nYou’re reading Emerging Cricket — brought to you by a passionate group of volunteers with a vision for cricket to be a truly global sport, and a mission to inspire passion to grow the game.\n\nBe sure to check out our homepage for all the latest news, please subscribe for regular updates, and follow EC on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube.\n\nDon’t know where to start?

        "body": "Major League Cricket has revealed some major players in the business and tech communities intend to spearhead funding for the recently launched league. Led by Microsoft, a Series A and A1 totaling €42 million (approximately US $44 million), plus an additional €72.6 million (US $76 million) are being committed.\n\nOther lead investors include Madrona Venture Group which has specialized in seed and early stage investing since 1995.\n\nThe combined €114.6 million (US $120 million) will be earmarked largely for infrastructure efforts – namely top-of-the-line cricket-specific training centers and stadiums. A facility in Redmond, Washington known as Marymoor Park has been mentioned, along with a former soccer venue and minor league baseball stadium called AirHogs Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nOther targeted sites include improvements to an existing space in Morrisville, North Carolina and a vacant parcel of land totaling 20 acres in Irvine, California southeast of Los Angeles for a 10,000-seat location.\n\nMajor League Cricket hopes to transform the sport’s image from one thought of almost entirely in international circles to one that is far more accessible worldwide.\n\nMadrona and Microsoft both with roots in the Seattle-area have expressed a keen interest in expanding beyond the estimated 3,500-person existing cricket community and three adult cricket leagues.\n\nYouth programs have experienced a roughly 500-person increase in participation in recent years. The upstart Seattle thunderbolts, with backing from some tech investors, commenced play in 2021 too.\n\nIf successful, the Marymoor Cricket Community Park would serve as the host for other professional cricket events like the U.S. National Team, a potential World Cup, and Major League Cricket itself. Inclusion of cricket in the 2028 Olympics to be held in Los Angeles is not out of the question too.\n\nMajor League Cricket will specifically focus on the T20 community, which for cricket novices indicates a limit of 20 overs of gameplay. Traditional cricket play has no gameplay limits and often can require multiple days to complete a single match. Since its founding in the early aughts, T20 play is felt by many to be far more appealing to a younger audience with shorter attention spans, which in turn might be more conducive to attracting a heightened level of interest in cricket overall.\n\nThe fundraising news occurs roughly three years after word emerged of USA Cricket’s vision to rain US $1 billion to expand the sport domestically.\n\nMatch play for Major League Cricket will begin in 2023."

        "title": "MLC 2023, Texas Super Kings vs MI New York Highlights: All-round TSK beat MINY by 17 runs",
        "date": "Tue Jul 18 05:19:35 2023",
        "body": "Three runs and two wickets off that final over from Daniel Sams. As good as it gets in T20 cricket. MINY wrap up on 137/8. They never really got going and when they did, they got out in quite extraordinary ways. An excellent bowling performance from TSK, they gave just 39 runs away in the last four overs.\n\nThat's two in two for Mohsin. Another googly from him and Pollard seems to know little about it. Ball goes past the inside edge and hits him on the pad, umpire gives it out but Pollard reviews. Bat and pad are quire close and for a second, it looks like Pollard might have got something on it. But the third umpire rules that he has inconclusive evidence and asks the umpire to stay with his decision.\n\nWhat a big wicket this is and what a terrible way for MINY to lose it. Pooran calls for a second run that was just not on. The fielder at deep extra cover comes in and puts in a bullet throw to Conway, who whips off the bails. Replays show that Pooran was well short. Pooran himself was slow to turn and has ran himself out.\n\nWell Steven Taylor's sluggish 15 off 21 came to an end in the ninth over and that might be a boon for MINY because it has brought the dangerous Nicholas Pooran out there. Mohammad Mohsin bowls the second ball of the 10th in his arc and Pooran smashes it over the bowler's head.\n\nMINY's opening stand lasts just eight balls. A fantastic delivery from Theron, full and jagging away late. Monank Patel plays it and edges it to Conway.\n\nMonank Patel c Conway b Theron 0 (2), MINY 4/1 in 1.2 overs\n\nSantner's little dash in the end has helped TSK put up a score of over 150. It hasn't been the most fluid of T20 innings you would ever see. But then if it was difficult for the team batting first, there is a very good chance that it won't be easy for the team batting second.\n\nOff pace delivery from Pollard, Chetty tries to go over long off after coming down the track. No power at all and he holes out to Rashid Khan at long on.\n\nCody Chetty c Rashid Khan b Pollard 12 (18), TSK 58/2 in 8.3 overs\n\nA four off the fourth ball and a four off the sixth. and Conway is away. Bowling the second over is Trent Boult and he will be up against Faf du Plessis. Two proper giants of international cricket across formats.\n\nNatalie Germanos and Sunil Gavaskar were on pitch report duties today: It's pretty warm - 40 degrees Celsius. Same strip that was used yesterday. Even square boundaries, longer hit straight. More wickets have fallen to pace in this tournament but spinners have been consistent. This looks like a very good pitch to bat on, little bit of grass and new ball bowlers will get some help early on.\n\nTSK had to chase down a target of 164 in their last match. That started looking like an impossible task when they were reduced to 78/6 in 14 overs. However, then came an act of rolling back the years from veteran Dwayne Bravo. Bravo smashed 76 off 39 balls in an innings that included five fours and six sixes and almost single-handedly brought Texas to within six runs of the target.

        "body": "During umpteenth travels across the Atlantic, Liam Plunkett constantly found himself in a quandary about possibly relocating to the U.S, where his wife Emeleah is from.\n\nAs a professional cricketer, with the pace bowler having represented England from 2005-19, his employment prospects in the sport appeared rather slim in a country where the British bat and ball game is merely a curiosity at best.\n\n\"I started flying back and forth to America after I met my wife 15 years ago,\" Plunkett told me in an interview.\n\n\"As we got more serious, I could see myself living in the U.S. but I didn't know what I'd be doing there. What does that look like?\"\n\nPlunkett's last international game proved his career highpoint having helped England to a momentous World Cup triumph on home soil in mid-2019.\n\nBut it ended on a bitter note as England sought to focus on younger bowlers, with Plunkett blindsided by management's shift in direction as he suddenly found himself pondering his future.\n\n\"Do I stay in County cricket (in the UK) or go into coaching or mentorship?\" he thought at the time.\n\nFortunately, Major League Cricket - a pro T20 franchise league hoped to spur the unfulfilled potential of cricket in the world's biggest sports market - came calling and after numerous setbacks will finally launch on July 13.\n\nThe league's hierarchy has sought particular expertise from veteran players with an American link.\n\n\"I got a phone call from MLC and they said 'listen, we understand your wife's here. Do you want to come on board with Major League Cricket?',\" said Plunkett, who jumped at the opportunity and in 2021 made the move to his new home of Pennsylvania.\n\nPlunkett has been tasked with helping set up MLC and making it \"more professional\", while running cricket academies in Philadelphia.\n\n\"You have kids here in America, under 11s and 13s, who are as good as anywhere in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"The drop off comes at 15 because there hadn't really been that next next pathway here. There's no real sustainable revenue to make a career out of it.\n\n\"We are hoping academies will provide a pipeline for those who are still developing their skills to have more high performance training.\n\n\"Hopefully MLC can show that it's possible to make a living through cricket.\"\n\nPlunkett will be one of the headline players for San Francisco Unicorns, led by former Australia captain Aaron Finch, but the tournament's ultimate success could hinge on emerging national cricketers.\n\nSpinning all-rounder Sanjay Krishnamurthi will be Plunkett's teammate at the Unicorns with the 20-year-old having already played international cricket for the U.S.\n\nArizona-raised Krishnamurthi developed an affinity with cricket from his India-born father, but truly fell in love with the sport when India memorably won the 2011 World Cup on home soil.\n\nJust a few months later, Krishnamurthi and his parents moved to India where his skills developed quickly amid specialist training and intense competition.\n\n\"There are so many players at a high level in India, whereas in the U.S. we have a few really good players but it drops off,\" he told me in an interview.\n\nKrishnamurthi returned to the U.S. seeking greater playing opportunities and represents the type of emerging talent hoped to capture the imagination of local fans.\n\n\"If I can help a few kids pick up the game and fall in love with it like I did...that would be exciting,\" he said.\n\nRealizing that American cricket needs homegrown heroes, like Krishnamurthi, Plunkett has resisted the temptation to play in next year's T20 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S.\n\n\"That was never really my ambition to play,\" he said. \"I feel like players who are younger or who grafted hard deserve to play. U.S. cricket will get better with these youngsters being exposed to professional cricket.\"\n\nPlunkett, however, will soon be lining up for Unicorns in MLC's opening season as they build a brand from scratch in a world famous sports city.\n\nVisibility will be tough initially with the Unicorns still in the midst of developing a cricket stadium in Santa Clara. The inaugural MLC season will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\n\"It will be tricky in the first couple of years for the whole league until every franchise has their stadium,\" he said. \"But there's a lot of cricket that is played in San Francisco, so there is a cricket base.\n\n\"We will need to hit the right market to help it grow. It would be good to get some big athletes involved like Kevin Durant investing in the Philadelphia Union in Major League Soccer.\"\n\nEven before launching, MLC has caused a stir with the tournament to be played in peak summer, a quieter period in the congested American sports scene but clashing with England's cricket season.\n\nThe well-heeled tournament - already boasting funding of over $100 million - has lured opener Jason Roy, who cancelled his England deal to sign a larger contract with MLC.\n\nPlunkett has suddenly found himself torn in the middle, having experienced the exhilaration and pride of representing England across formats, but now resembling a recruiter.\n\n\"People (England cricketers) do reach out to me. I still speak to a lot of the guys. It's piqued the interest that's for sure,\" he said.\n\n\"They want to know how it (MLC) is going. Hopefully there are opportunities for guys to get across and that it can coexist with the England season.\"\n\nIn similar sentiment expressed by MLC's hierarchy, which they hope is a notable point of difference to other leagues, Plunkett believed the glamorous American sports market can lure those reluctant to go on the T20 franchise merry-go-round.\n\n\"It's very exciting for players,\" he said. \"Sports is so big in America, that if we can crack the market then there are other opportunities for players to network and open up streams of revenue in terms of commercially and sponsorship.\"\n\nPressure is on for MLC, which will finally be unleashed after Covid-19 delays and well-worn tumult within American cricket, but there is confidence from within that it can become a harbinger for the sport in coveted terrain.\n\n\"I want people tuning in from the U.K. and Australia to recognize an amazing product, but it feels American as well,\" Plunkett said.\n\n\"If I can be one of the people who spearheaded this and made it grow then that will be a pretty amazing legacy.\""

        "body": "George Bernard Shaw asserted “the English are not very spiritual people so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.”\n\nIt has been a long game, traditionally.\n\nWhile cricket has flourished in England and some of its former colonies, it has never taken off to the same degree in the United States, where some have perceived it as impenetrable.\n\nA sport played in its purist form by players in long white uniforms, test cricket goes on for five days and still often ends with no winner, with days so long players twice have to leave the field for meals.\n\nMajor League Cricket, which begins on Thursday, could change that perception. For a start, the games only go for just over three hours.\n\nMLC will comprise six teams, from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, New York and Washington, which will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\n\nTeams will have a maximum of 19 and minimum of 16 players, combining international stars and home-grown players selected through a draft which was made when the league was launched, officially and metaphorically, at Space Center Houston. Each team was allowed to sign nine local players, one of which had to be under-23.\n\nThe salaries of international players will be drawn from an initial $120 million investment from corporate backers, mainly from India.\n\nThe teams will play Twenty20 style which might be portrayed as cricket with the dull bits removed. The format may be more appealing to the American sport palate because there is always a winner: if the teams are still tied after both innings — each comprising 20 six-ball overs — a tie-breaking “super over” is played to find the winner.\n\nMost matches will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, converted to a cricket stadium with 7,200 seats and a grass pitch. Other matches will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThe league follows the model of professional Twenty20 — or more broadly known as T20 — leagues which already exist in places such as India, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Canada. They’re all supported by a travelling troupe of international players — many of them T20 specialists — who give leagues marquee quality.\n\nThe most lucrative and glamorous of all these franchise competitions is the Indian Premier League, where the world’s best players are hired by teams owned by Bollywood stars, business giants and other celebrities. The gravitational pull of the IPL has reshaped cricket’s traditional schedules and made many new cricketing millionaires.\n\nMajor League Cricket inevitably will have some of the Indian Premier League glitz. Four of the six teams are owned and will be run by IPL franchises.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders will be run by the Knight Riders Group which operate the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. MI New York will be run by the Mumbai Indians, Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas by the GMR Group which runs the Delhi Capitals.\n\nTwo of Australia’s provincial organizations — Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales — will run the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom respectively.\n\nMany of the biggest stars from India, Australia and England are involved in test series — more of those five-day matches — but MLC has attracted a strong contingent of seasoned T20 performers.\n\nBollywood star Shah Rukh Khan co-owns the Knight Riders Group and has recruited West Indies stars Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, England’s Jason Roy, South Africa’s Rilee Rossouw, Australian Adam Zampa and New Zealanders Lockie Ferguson and Martin Guptill.\n\n“We have assembled a strong and talented team for the debut season of MLC who can compete at the highest level and bring joy to cricket fans around the world,” Knight Riders Group chief executive Venky Mysore said.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have hired South Africa’s Faf du Plessis as captain alongside international stars Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, David Miller, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee.\n\nChennai Super Kings chief executive K.S. Viswanathan said du Plessis “led the Joburg Super Kings at (the South African T20 league) from the front earlier this year and we’re confident of doing well under him in Texas.”\n\nThe West Indies and Mumbai Indians star Kieron Pollard will captain New York, which will have Robin Peterson as head coach and Lasith Malinga as bowling coach. Their signings include fast bowlers Trent Boult from New Zealand and Kagiso Rabada from South Africa.\n\nSeattle has Australian star Mitch Marsh and South Africa’s Quinton de Kock.\n\nMLC has broader ambitions, to build minor leagues in a bid to develop training and development facilities and support the U.S. national team.\n\nNow it remains to be seen whether American fans will find Major League Cricket to their taste and make the league itself everlasting.\n\n___"

        "title": "Cricket's resurgence in the USA: The impact of Major League Cricket",
        "date": "Fri Jul 21 19:59:22 2023",
        "body": "Cricket was the USA's national game once upon a time, and the nation also served as the birthplace of the sport's very first international match. It may sound like an unbelievable story, but the historic encounter between the United States and Canada took place in none other than the city of New York.\n\nIn 1844, an enthusiastic crowd of 10,000 spectators gathered at NYC's Bloomingdale Park to witness this momentous event. Cricket's roots had firmly planted themselves on the American soil, captivating the imaginations of enthusiasts. However, as the years passed, it faded into the background, overshadowed by the rise of other popular sports such as baseball and basketball.\n\nBut now, a new chapter in American cricket is being written as Major League Cricket arrives in the Lone Star State of Texas. The question on everyone's lips is whether this sport, with its rich history, can once again capture the hearts and minds of the American people.\n\nWhile crowds may not immediately pack the stadiums to the rafters, the Major League Cricket is fresh and holds the promise of rekindling the nation's forgotten love for the game. With its strategic location, diverse population, and a renewed interest in embracing different sports, Texas serves as the ideal backdrop for this cricketing revival.\n\nSustainability of Major League Cricket in the USA\n\nAs the bat meets the ball on the American soil once again, Major League Cricket aims to capture the essence of the sport's glory days, injecting it with a fresh and modern twist. By showcasing the skills and talents of international players alongside a crop of promising American cricketing talent, the league seeks to establish a new era of cricketing excellence and fan engagement in the United States.\n\nThe rapid and action-packed T20 cricket format has gained immense popularity through franchise leagues in various countries like Pakistan, Australia, the Caribbean, and England. However, the crown jewel is undoubtedly the Indian Premier League (IPL), which recently emerged as the most-watched digital sports event worldwide.\n\nWith its extravagant success, the IPL has become a multi-million dollar powerhouse. It generates broadcasting fees exceeding $15 million per match and has positioned itself as the second richest league globally, second only to the NFL.\n\nThe IPL owes much of its financial strength to significant investments from American stakeholders such as Silver Lake Partners, TPG Capital, and KKR & Co. This infusion of capital has propelled the league's growth, transforming it into a desirable product to emulate.\n\nThe three-hour matches, packed with colossal sixes, top-tier talent from around the world, captivating on-field entertainment, and cutting-edge technology showcased in impressive stadiums, have contributed to its mass appeal.\n\nNow, Major League Cricket finds itself in a similar position, armed with substantial financial backing. The next steps involve creating a compelling visual experience, establishing state-of-the-art facilities, and building a dedicated fanbase.\n\nThe tournament is a collaborative effort between The Times of India Group, the country's largest media conglomerate, and has garnered substantial initial funding of $120 million (£94m). This impressive financial backing includes prominent figures such as Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft.\n\nIndia and the MLC\n\nCricket's global landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation with a gradual shift towards franchise-based cricket. This could mark a groundbreaking turning point with the introduction of the Indian Premier League's (IPL) franchises into the United States through the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) edition.\n\nThe impact of this development cannot be overstated, as four of the six MLC franchises have already been taken over or received significant investments from IPL giants. Kolkata Knight Riders have set their sights on Los Angeles, Chennai Super Kings are expanding to Texas, Mumbai Indians are making their mark in New York, and Delhi Capitals have found a home in Seattle as the Seattle Orcas.\n\nSuch a move is set to reshape the cricketing ecosystem permanently, attracting new audiences, and enhancing the sport's global appeal. The participation of IPL franchises in MLC brings a wealth of experience, star players, and a passionate fanbase, which is sure to create a thrilling and engaging cricketing spectacle.\n\nEven the remaining two franchises, namely Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns, though not directly affiliated with the IPL, still have strong connections with Indian roots. San Francisco Unicorns boast top investors in Venture Capitalists Venky Hariharan and Anand Rajaraman, who have secured the involvement of Australian state side Victoria, adding an international dimension to their lineup.\n\nSimilarly, Washington Freedom is owned by Indian American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil, who has partnered with the New South Wales state cricket body from Australia. This infusion of diverse backgrounds and expertise will undoubtedly enrich the cricketing experience for players and fans alike.\n\nAnd let's not forget the star power involved. The Seattle franchise's inclusion of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella as one of the investors adds a touch of tech and glamor to the mix, further fueling excitement and interest in the league.\n\nAs cricket enthusiasts eagerly await the kickoff of Major League Cricket with these influential franchises on board, it's clear that the sport's future is set to be more enthralling and diverse than ever before.\n\nThe fusion of Indian cricketing prowess, international partnerships, and high-profile investors is a recipe for success, promising a new era for the sport on a global scale. The world of cricket is in for a thrilling ride as it embraces this bold and exciting evolution.\n\nThe sport's future\n\nCricket has been played in the United States for many years, but it has traditionally been a niche sport with a relatively small following, compared to those like baseball, American football, basketball, and soccer. Major League Cricket (MLC) is a professional cricket league that aims to promote and popularize the sport in the United States.\n\nMajor League Cricket's success and popularity will depend on several factors. These include its efforts to market and promote the sport effectively, the quality of play and competition, the accessibility of cricket facilities, and the level of interest among the American population.\n\nCricket faces significant challenges in breaking into the mainstream sports market in the United States due to the dominance of other established sports. However, there has been some growth in its popularity in recent years. This is driven by an increase in immigrant populations from cricket-playing countries and the efforts to develop cricket infrastructure and grassroots programs.\n\nIf Major League Cricket can capitalize on these trends, generate a strong fanbase, secure media coverage, and attract talented players, it could have a chance of gaining popularity in America. However, it will likely take time and sustained efforts to establish itself as a major sport in the country.\n\nUltimately, Major League Cricket's future popularity in America will depend on its ability and stakeholders to overcome the challenges and generate widespread interest and support for the sport.\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) has the potential to revolutionize cricket in the United States. With its ambitious plans to establish a professional league and promote the game at the grassroots level, MLC aims to introduce cricket to a wider audience and create a thriving cricket culture in the country.\n\nThe league's focus on engaging local communities, developing young talent, and fostering international collaborations demonstrates its commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.\n\nAs MLC gains momentum and attracts top players from around the world, it has the opportunity to establish itself as a prominent cricket league on the global stage. With its innovative approach and unwavering passion for the game, Major League Cricket is poised to make a significant impact and reshape the cricket landscape in the United States."

        "date": "Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "For decades, cricket’s powers have dreamed of making it big in America. Starting on Thursday the grandest, richest attempt yet to get Americans hooked on cricket will begin in a converted baseball stadium (capacity: 7,200) on the outskirts of Dallas. Major League Cricket, as the new competition is known, has money: close to $50m already spent, with another $130m on the way. It has wealthy patrons: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella leads a roll call of leading Indian-American tech executives who’ve signed up to throw cash at the new venture. It has the blessing of an International Cricket Council desperate to lift its sport’s profile in America ahead of the 2024 T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies. It has powerful allies: four Indian Premier League franchises and two state cricket bodies from Australia have signed on as either full owners or operational partners for the fledgling league’s six founding teams. It has a slot in the international cricket calendar that’s relatively uncrowded, with only the men’s and women’s Ashes as real competition for the committed global cricket fan’s attention. It has a list of team names that combine, in delightfully unbound American style, the patriotic (Washington Freedom) and ecological (Seattle Orcas) with the borrowed-from-the-IPL nonsensical (MI New York).\n\nMost importantly it has players, and some extremely capable ones at that: sprinkled among the little-known local talents (Corne Dry, anyone?) the new competition features the genuine stardust of Wanindu Hasaranga, Kagiso Rabada, Tim David and Anrich Nortje, among many other established T20 internationals who’ve made the trek out to the suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex to help launch cricket’s latest big shot at success in America. But will Major League Cricket have any viewers? Will the American public thrill to the spectacle of a beefy heave through midwicket from Aaron Finch? Will it learn to lament, as millions of cricket fans throughout the world already do, the lost opportunities of a wasted PowerPlay? Will it grow to appreciate the finer points of an Adam Zampa strangler down leg side, or a topless cameo from Faf du Plessis on the player balcony? The final touches – the marking of the boundary barrier, the laying of the turf wicket, the engineering of the outfield – have just been applied to convert the former home ground of now-defunct off-brand baseball side the Texas AirHogs into an international-grade cricket venue. The dream is in place, the field has been built. But will they come?\n\nThe history of the flatter-batted of the bat and ball sports in the United States provides some basis for caution. Vying with baseball for local supremacy in the late 19th century, cricket enjoyed a brief American “golden age” thanks to the exertions of the Philadelphia Cricket Club, once seen as the equal of the best international teams. But Britain’s late-imperial insecurity saw the US frozen out of international competition, and American cricket went into a rapid and seemingly irreversible decline in the years following the first world war. Since the turn of this century there have been several failed attempts to launch a professional domestic cricket league: Pro Cricket, a prototype of T20 cricket, played a single season in 2004 before folding, while the original ‘Major League Cricket’, launched in 2005 with the patronage of West Indian greats Clive Lloyd and Desmond Haynes, quickly fizzled into insignificance. Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar hosted a series of exhibition matches across the US in 2015 that got expats and immigrants of South Asian, Caribbean and Australian backgrounds excited but no one else. How many times can a sport this old to America be rebranded as something exotic and new? Compounding the inauspiciousness of this history are the troubles facing USA Cricket. The administration and finances of cricket’s governing body in America are a mess, continuing a long history of mismanagement of the sport in this country; the previous governing body was expelled by the ICC in 2017. USA Cricket will have no permanent CEO in place when Major League Cricket launches on Thursday night.\n\nMLC’s organizers recognize that the road ahead presents some obstacles: “We are somewhat concerned by and appreciative of USA Cricket’s struggles,” says Sameer Mehta, one of the league’s co-CEOs. But he and his fellow founder, Vijay Srinivasan, are thinking big. Mehta and Srinivasan launched Willow TV, the primary streaming app for cricket in the US, in the early 2000s, before selling it to The Times Group, India’s biggest media conglomerate, in 2016. With the money and connections from that sale they have created Major League Cricket, and they believe the time is finally right for America to fully embrace the flat-batted sport. Partly this is because of the recent “cosmopolitan turn” among American sports fans, who are now just as likely to tune in to the late laps from Monza (the Drive to Survive effect, let’s call it) or Brentford v West Ham as they are to enjoy local pro sports. Mostly, though, it’s a function of the growing economic clout and cultural self-confidence of America’s Indian population – almost five million strong, fantastically wealthy (at $140,000, Indian Americans have the highest per capita household wealth of any ethnic group in the US), and growing rapidly thanks to Silicon Valley’s inexhaustible thirst for South Asian tech talent. “It’s insane how successful this community has become so quickly in the last couple of decades,” says Mehta. “But they haven’t brought their culture with them. It’s only very recently that they are flexing their muscles.” Major League Cricket looms as the Indian American community’s next big flex.\n\nCan a sport with serious financial backing and an existing fan base among America’s ex-Commonwealth migrant population strike gold in the land of the free? Can the transmitted enthusiasm of the Australian flat white makers of Brooklyn help unleash cricket fever across all 50 states? At times it can feel difficult to imagine how this experiment might succeed. Talking to Americans about cricket is usually about as easy as explaining climate change to a ferret. But for MLC, a template of sorts exists. From its “anchor” fan base among the country’s Hispanic migrant population, Major League Soccer has expanded at such a rate over the past two decades that the round ball game now outranks hockey on most metrics as America’s fourth most popular sport. Cricket is arguably a tougher sell to the American public than soccer: it’s played by fewer countries at elite level, and the sport’s global profusion of formats and competitions means cricket lacks some of the clarity of football’s cultural hierarchy, under which Europe’s top domestic leagues are unanimously considered the pinnacle of competition. But if any “foreign” sport is going to break through and make it in America, why not this one?\n\nMLC’s backers think they have the goods to win over the American heartland. Mehta insists the league is not a play to win Indian viewership but a direct gamble on the sport’s potential appeal to Americans; each of the founding franchises has committed to building a stadium in its home city so the league can evolve as a proper home-and-away competition in the years to come. The league is making all the right noises about professional “pathways” for domestic cricketers, developing local talent, and so on. Teams are required to fit a minimum of nine local players under the squad salary cap of $1.15m; up to nine overseas players can be selected but a maximum of six are allowed in each starting XI. Games for the inaugural tournament have been scheduled mostly at night to cater to US viewers, rather than during hours more suitable to the TV audience in India. “Americans don’t like to be lectured about a sport that’s being played elsewhere,” says Mehta. “But if the sport’s being played in their country right next to them, they are absolute sports fanatics, and they will sample anything and everything. Our view is that T20 is an amazing sport for US consumption and for US audiences. It fits in with what Americans like to consume: it’s three hours long, there’s lots of action, it has some similarities with baseball but then has a lot of compelling differences also.”\n\nThe format of the inaugural tournament is straightforward: the six teams will play each other once, and the top four sides will contest three qualification and elimination games before the final is held on 30 July. Three of the group games will be played at a 3,000-capacity ground in North Carolina; the rest will take place at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. Major League Cricket is promising a 30-camera, world class broadcast production at both venues for the games, which will be shown live on Willow TV, with a mainstream broadcast partner set to be announced before the opening fixture. In future years, Mehta hopes, the league will expand to 10 teams with a longer season.\n\nThe teams for the inaugural season seem genuinely competitive and evenly matched, with the possible exception of the Seattle Orcas, who are likely to depend very heavily on the fluctuating powers of Quinton de Kock. The San Francisco Unicorns sport incredible hitting strength (Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade), while Washington Freedom have perhaps the league’s most balanced squad, boasting pace (Nortje, Marco Jansen), middle-order power (Josh Philippe, Moises Henriques), and world cricket’s best T20 all-rounder (Hasaranga). The Los Angeles Knight Riders mix T20 A-listers (Adam Zampa, Jason Roy), veterans (Martin Guptill), exuberantly named locals (Shadley van Schalkwyk), and mercurial post-international mercenaries capable of devastating displays of power hitting (Andre Russell, Rilee Roussow) in a proportion that already feels, despite the league’s immaturity, canonical.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings, meanwhile, are very dependent on du Plessis and an aging Dwayne Bravo, but they also boast dual-passport Australian-American “local” Cameron Stevenson, who’s the only player in the tournament to have his profile photo featured on both the official MLC website and the “about” page of a Melbourne-based civil engineering firm. Stevenson played professional cricket for Tasmania for two years until 2018 and now works as an engineer for the firm that reshaped Grand Prairie Stadium into a cricket ground; he qualifies as a local for MLC purposes thanks to his American mother. It’s curiosities like this that give MLC its special charm, but the magic is not confined solely to the league’s less heralded names. Celebrated ex-players want their part of history: Stephen Fleming, Lasith Malinga, and Shane Watson are all involved in MLC as coaches. MI New York boast an outstanding bowling attack that includes Rabada, Trent Boult and Jason Behrendorff, but its crowning glory is Rashid Khan, captain of Afghanistan and the world’s top ranked T20 bowler. More than two decades on from the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, Major League Cricket presents the tantalizing prospect of a genuine Afghan superstar – a man who grew up in the kiln of the US occupation and whose family was forced into exile for several years during the worst of the violence – exhibiting his wrist-spinning artistry on an American field of play. Despite the sport’s long history in the US, cricket’s latest assault on America feels somehow novel, like the stage for a fresh encounter between two parts of the world that have rarely understood each other in anything other than antagonistic terms."

        "body": "This news came from The Stadium Business at this link.\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC), the new Twenty20 competition which aims to boost the sport’s presence in the United States, has set July 13, 2023, as its launch date, while outlining further details concerning its venue development plans.\n\nMLC’s opening match will take place at the newly-constructed Grand Prairie Stadium, in Grand Prairie, Texas. The 2023 season will feature 19 matches to be played over 18 days, building up to the first-ever MLC championship final on July 30.\n\nSix teams from major metropolitan areas – representing Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Seattle and New York City – will each have multiple global stars on their rosters alongside the best talent based in the US.\n\n“Next summer, the eyes of world cricket will be on the launch of Major League Cricket, with the stars of the game competing over three weeks of fast-paced T20 action,” said Justin Geale, MLC tournament director.\n\n“The launch of MLC will transform American cricket and provide one of the best platforms in the sport for the world’s most elite players to showcase their skills while also fast-tracking the development of domestic talent to feature in the league.”\n\nA special ceremony at Grand Prairie Stadium yesterday (Tuesday) marked the installation of the 7,200-capacity venue’s playing pitch, with construction set to be complete in spring 2023. Grand Prairie Stadium, in the works since November 2020 and located in the heart of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, will be the competition’s primary venue for the 2023 season and home venue for Dallas’ MLC team.\n\n“Grand Prairie Stadium will be the best cricket venue in the United States upon its completion,” said Ron Jensen, Mayor of Grand Prairie. “This venue will be a huge asset to the Grand Prairie community, bringing Major League Cricket, international cricket and potentially the 2024 ICC T20 Men’s World Cup to Grand Prairie allowing fans here to experience a world class sport in action.”\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium, the former home of the Texas AirHogs American Association of Independent Professional Baseball team, is being converted to a cricket-specific facility at a cost of $20m (£16.9m/€19.3m) with the addition of seats around the oval increasing permanent capacity to 7,200.\n\nThe venue will feature 1,000 club and premium seats, with the ability to expand to a capacity of over 15,000 for major events. It is expected to host matches at the T20 World Cup in 2024, set to be co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies.\n\nWork was originally due to be complete earlier this year, but has seen delays that have also resulted in the launch of MLC’s first season being postponed by more than a year.\n\nA host of other US cricket venues are being planned, but ESPNcricinfo reports that slow progress on these could see Grand Prairie Stadium serve as the sole host for MLC’s debut season.\n\nMLC in May completed an initial $44m Series A and A1 fundraising round, with an additional commitment of $76m in further fundraising guaranteed over the next 12 months to support the development of stadiums and training centres across the US."

        "body": "The inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC) begins on 14 July and will become the latest addition to the growing list of franchise T20 leagues across the globe. However, the investment the league has attracted and the hope that it could lead to a cricket revolution in the USA has already made it the cynosure of all eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the MLC kicks off, here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming T20 league.\n\nIs USA a cricket playing country?\n\nYes, they are an Associate member of the ICC with ODI status and took part in the recently concluded ICC ODI World Cup 2023 Qualifiers in Zimbabwe. In fact, USA were also part of the first cricket match involving two countries in 1844. They played against Canada at the St George’s Cricket Club ground in New York.\n\nHas ICC approved MLC?\n\nThe ICC officially sanctioned MLC in April this year and the league has also been approved by USA Cricket. MLC will not be operated by USA Cricket but by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE).\n\nACE is promoted by Willow TV founders, Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, and Times of India’s Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain. Willow TV is the largest cricket broadcaster in North America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statistics from the MLC will not be recorded against players’ profiles as the USA is not a Full-Member nation of the ICC.\n\nMLC teams and format\n\nSix teams will take part in the first season; Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll teams will be part of a single round-robin format following which the top four teams will qualify for the playoffs. The playoffs will include four matches — Qualifier 1, Eliminator, Qualifier 2 and the Final.\n\nVenues\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville will together host the 19 matches of the first season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho are the team owners?\n\nYou are not wrong if you think Los Angeles Knight Riders belong to the Kolkata Knight Riders family.\n\nFour of the six MLC teams are owned by IPL franchise owners.\n\nTexas Super Kings belong to the Chennai Super Kings family and MI New York are with the Mumbai Indians group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeattle Orcas are owned by GMR Group, the co-owner of Delhi Capitals.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns are owned by Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan. They have partnered with Australia’s Cricket Victoria to run the franchise. Washington Freedom, owned by Sanjay Govil, have partnered with Cricket New South Wales.\n\nTV broadcast and live streaming\n\nWillow TV has the broadcast right for USA and Canada. The MLC will be shown live on Sports18 and JioTV in India.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich big names will take part in MLC?\n\nA galaxy of stars will descend on the USA for the MLC including Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Rashid Khan, Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Jason Roy, Trent Boult, Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway, David Miller, Quinton de Kock, Shimron Hetmyer and Anrich Nortje among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs there a cap on overseas players?\n\nIn MLC, each franchise can have a maximum of 19 players and a minimum of 16. They need to have a minimum of 10 domestic players including at least one U23 USA player. In the playing XI, teams can have a maximum of six overseas players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there Indian players in MLC?\n\nThere are quite a few of them. However, all of these players have retired from Indian domestic cricket. They include Unmukt Chand, Harmeet Singh, Smit Patel, Sarbjeet Singh Ladda, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Tajinder Singh Dhillon, Milind Kumar and Shubham Ranjane.\n\nFull schedule, match timing and venue\n\nFixtureDateVenueTimeTexas Super Kings vs Los Angeles Knight Riders14 JulyDallas6 AM ISTMI New York vs San Francisco Unicorns15 JulyDallas2 AM ISTSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom15 JulyDallas6 AM ISTSan Francisco Unicorns vs Seattle Orcas16 JulyDallas6 AM ISTTexas Super Kings vs Washington Freedom17 JulyDallas2 AM ISTLos Angeles Knight Riders vs MI New York17 JulyDallas6 AM ISTTexas Super Kings vs MI New York18 JulyDallas6 AM ISTLos Angeles Knight Riders vs San Francisco Unicorns19 JulyDallas6 AM ISTWashington Freedom vs Los Angeles Knight Riders21 JulyMorrisville3 AM ISTSeattle Orcas vs Texas Super Kings22 JulyMorrisville3 AM ISTWashington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns23 JulyMorrisville3 AM ISTLos Angeles Knight Riders vs Seattle Orcas23 JulyMorrisville11 PM ISTMI New York vs Washington Freedom24 JulyMorrisville3 AM ISTSan Francisco Unicorns vs Texas Super Kings25 JulyMorrisville3 AM ISTMI New York vs Seattle Orcas26 JulyMorrisville3 AM ISTEliminator (3 vs 4)28 JulyDallas2 AM ISTQualifier 1 (1 vs 2)28 JulyDallas6 AM ISTQualifier 229 JulyDallas6 AM ISTFinal31 JulyDallas6 AM IST\n\nMLC squads\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Jason Roy, Lockie Ferguson, Martin Guptill, Adam Zampa, Rilee Rossouw, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan, Unmukt Chand, Jaskaran Malhotra, Nitish Kumar, Corne Dry, Ali Sheikh, Saif Badar, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Bhaskar Yadram, Gajanand Singh\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMI New York: Kieron Pollard, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Tim David, Dewald Brevis, David Wiese, Kagiso Rabada, Nicholas Pooran, Jason Behrendorff, Steven Taylor, Hammad Azam, Ehsan Adil, Nosthush Kenjige, Monank Patel, Sarbjeet Ladda, Shayan Jahangir, Kyle Phillip, Saideep Ganesh, Jasdeep Singh\n\nSeattle Orcas: Quinton de Kock, Wayne Parnell, Dasun Shanaka, Sikandar Raza, Harmeet Singh, Shehan Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjane, Cameron Gannon, Aaron Jones, Nauman Anwar, Phani Simhadri, Angelo Perera, Matthew Tromp, Nisarg Patel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Lungi Ndigi, Corey Anderson, Liam Plunkett, Tajinder Singh, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Carmi Le Roux, Brody Couch, David White, Smit Patel, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Amila Aponso\n\nTexas Super Kings: Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Daniel Sams, David Miller Gerald Coetzee, Dwayne Bravo, Rusty Theron, Calvin Savage, Lahiru Milantha, Milind Kumar, Sami Aslam, Cameron Stevenson, Cody Chetty, Zia Shahzad, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Mohammad Mohsin\n\nAdvertisement"

Some top international stars will do their billing in USA’s first-ever professional franchise cricket league. The MLC Schedule kicks off on July 14 with Texas Super Kings taking on the Los Angeles Knight Riders. If the names sound familiar, it is because four of the 6 teams are owned by IPL teams.\n\nPer the MLC release, Two cricket-specific venues in North Texas (Grand Prairie Stadium) and Greater Raleigh (Church Street Park) will host 19 matches. Texas will host the initial games before the second leg shifts to Morrisville. The MLC Playoffs however will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium. The MLC 2023 Final is set for July 30.\n\nAlso Read: CSK legend Suresh Raina to be part of LPL 2023 Auction\n\nTeams participating in MLC 2023\n\nTexas Super Kings (owned by Chennai Super Kings)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders (Owned by Kolkata Knight Riders)\n\nSeattle Orcas (partly owned by Delhi Capitals)\n\nMI New York (owned by Mumbai Indians)\n\nWashington Freedom (partnership with New South Wales)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns (partnership with Victoria)\n\nIn its debut season, the MLC has managed to attract some major star power. The likes of Jason Roy, Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Finch, Quinton de Kock, Mitchell Marsh, Anrich Nortje and Wanindu Hasaranga have all signed for the competition. The organisers have also carved out a window, with the tournament ending a couple of days before The Hundred begins. The ECB’s competition meanwhile clashes with the CPL 2023 and the Lanka Premier League. All three leagues will be held in the same time frame.\n\nLike the IPL, the MLC employs a playoff format for the knockouts. The top four teams in the standings make it to the playoffs, with the Eliminator, the Qualifiers and the Final in tow. International and domestic broadcast details for the historic competition will be announced soon, MLC announced in a statement.\n\nMLC 2023 Schedule"

        "date": "Mon Jul 10 16:00:50 2023",
        "body": "Baseball may be America’s national pastime, but globally its popularity doesn’t come close to cricket. The other—and much older—game with bats and balls has origins dating back to the 16th century, and estimates put its fanbase at more than 2.5 billion people, second only to soccer. Major League Cricket debuts July 13 in Dallas, er, Grand Prairie technically. With this newly formed US pro league, fans in North Texas and around the country will have a chance to cheer on local teams in person.\n\nThe new league features six teams, including the Texas Super Kings, which will play its games in Grand Prairie. Other teams are based in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington DC.\n\n“The Dallas area has one of the largest groups of cricket fans in the country, with hundreds of thousands of expats from countries such as India and Pakistan in the area who love the game,” says Tom Dumore, VP of Marketing for Major League Cricket.\n\nAll matches take on the Twenty20 (or “T20”) format, which is a shortened version of the traditional game that was introduced professionally about two decades ago.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\n“Cricket dates back to the 16th century, and sometimes the perception of it in the general population in the US is that it’s a stuffy game for British men in top hats, but nothing could be further from the truth,” says Dunmore. The T20 format, especially, is known for its fast-paced play, big hits, music, and fireworks. Matches clock in around two and a half hours, and the ball’s in play a lot more than in baseball, where abundant strikeouts can keep fans waiting multiple innings for action. For more on the rules, check out this helpful explainer from Vox.\n\nEarlier this year, MLC hosted a draft that allowed each team to select nine domestic players—most plucked from the Minor League Cricket circuit—and round out their rosters with international signings. Captain Faf du Plessis hails from South Africa and has enjoyed a successful career there as well as in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nThe Super Kings are coached by Stephen Fleming, a former captain of New Zealand’s national cricket team and the current head coach of IPL team the Chennai Super Kings. That’s not just a coincidence. The Texas team is co-owned by the Chennai Super Kings along with Ross Perot Jr. and businessman Anurag Jain.\n\nThe inaugural season is more like a tournament, with 19 matches played July 13 through July 30, when the championship takes place in Grand Prairie. Dunmore explains that next year is likely to enlist a similar format, especially as the T20 Men’s Cricket World Cup will also host games in the US. But as the league grows and stadiums are built in the home cities for each team, we can expect the season to expand in length and matches to occur in more markets.\n\nThe Super Kings have taken over the old AirHogs baseball stadium in Grand Prairie, renovating the space to accommodate 7,000 fans and a professional cricket pitch. The majority of games will be played in Grand Prairie this season, with additional games held at a dedicated cricket pitch in Morrisville, North Carolina, outside of Raleigh.\n\nThe first match is Thursday, July 13, when the Texas Super Kings take on the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nIf you can’t attend in person, no worries, matches will also be available to watch on TV. Live matches will be shown on Willow TV, a dedicated cricket channel, and available to stream on Sling TV.\n\n“There’s a reason the IPL now rivals the NFL and the English Premier League for media rights revenue,” adds Dunmore. “It’s a fantastic experience to watch live on TV or in person.”"

Lockie Ferguson bowled the ball outside off stump and du Plessis attempted to drive but only managed to send it to short extra cover, where Unmukt Chand took an easy catch.\n\nDu Plessis, who celebrated his 39th birthday on July 13, may not have had much to celebrate with the bat, but he walked away a happy man after the game as his team defeated LAKR by 69 runs.\n\nWatch du Plessis’ dismissal here:"

        "date": "Thu Jul 20 12:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Although cricket, a sport loved by billions of fans worldwide, has historically been slow to take hold in the United States, the current T20 tournament format offers a fresh opportunity to give the sport a foothold in the lucrative American market. T20 cricket, with games that can be completed in an evening (as opposed to five days for Test cricket and a full day for One-Day cricket) and its focus on fan entertainment, promises to provide a faster-paced, more engaging version of the traditional game. What’s more, with prominent international players taking part in the MLC tournament and games streamed live around the world, the league stands to get the benefit of a sizable international viewing base and multinational sponsors, giving it some runway to establish a dedicated American fan base.\n\nFor sponsors, the launch of MLC offers unique sponsorship and promotional opportunities and the potential ability to connect and engage with new audiences. Given cricket’s established international fan base in lucrative emerging markets such as India, US brands may view MLC as a new medium through which they can penetrate otherwise difficult-to-reach international markets and customers. In addition, the buzz of a new league in the US and the international star power present during the inaugural season may lead international brands to view MLC as a new opportunity to expand their reach in the US and engage with US consumers.\n\nThe excitement of the inaugural MLC season and the attention given to MLC also presents potentially lucrative opportunities for MLC and MLC teams and venues to monetize their investment by securing both short-term sponsorship opportunities with brands looking to capitalize on the current excitement and long-term partnerships with sponsors looking to “get in on the ground floor” of MLC and professional cricket in the US as a partner with the sport for years to come.\n\nThere are numerous risks and considerations that need to be taken into account with any sponsorship or promotional arrangement. Several notable examples include the scope of the sponsorship “category,” category exclusivity (if any), effect of force majeure events and work stoppages, allocation of costs, intellectual property protection, league rules, media rights and broadcast issues, and a whole host of other complex legal and business issues. Both the sponsors, on one hand, and the MLC and MLC teams and venues on the other, will need to create, negotiate, finalize, and activate sponsorship and promotional arrangements which are mutually beneficial for each party, which will likely model the arrangements used in the context of other professional sports leagues, but with modifications to reflect certain unique aspects inherent in the sport of cricket.\n\nArentFox Schiff’s Sports Practice Group boasts one of the most experienced and diverse sports practices in the country and regularly advises sports organizations (including leagues, conferences, teams, and national governing bodies), players, sponsors, and investors on a broad variety of sports matters, including numerous high-profile naming rights and sponsorship transactions."

        "title": "3 reasons why Texas Super Kings are favourites to win the inaugural Major League Cricket season",
        "date": "Wed Jul 12 00:33:07 2023",
        "body": "The inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket tournament will kick off on July 14 and the event will run for more than two weeks, with the Final slated for July 31. The six teams that will compete for the trophy are: Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom.\n\nThe leaders of the six teams are: Faf du Plessis (TSK), Sunil Narine (LAKR), Kieron Pollard (MINY), Aaron Finch (SFU), Moises Henriques (WF), and Wayne Parnell (SO).\n\nWhile all the six sides are quite balanced, the Texas Super Kings, led by the experienced Faf du Plessis, look like the team to beat in the MLC.\n\nHere, we look at three reasons why the Texas Super Kings are the favourites to win the inaugural season of the MLC:\n\n#1 Highly experienced squad\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have a bunch of players who are very experienced. The likes of David Miller, Faf du Plessis, Dwayne Bravo, Mitchell Santner, Daniel Sams, Devon Conway, and Rusty Theron have been around the circuit for a while now.\n\nMiller has played 446 T20s, du Plessis 343, Bravo 558, Santner 168, Sams 138, Conway 156, while Theron has featured in 129 games in the shortest format.\n\nMoreover, all of them have been a part of the Indian Premier League at some point or the other and that is an important point. Their experience will be a priceless asset as the Super Kings franchise looks to taste success in the first season of Major League Cricket.\n\n#2 Captaincy\n\nIn Faf du Plessis, the Texas Super Kings have a skipper who leads through his actions. Faf is easily one of the best players in the world even though he is at the wrong end of his 30s. He recently enjoyed a great run in the IPL, having fallen just short of winning the Orange Cap.\n\nHe was the captain of the Royal Challengers Bangalore and even though the side failed to make the playoffs, Faf's tactical smarts were extremely impressive.\n\nHe has led quite a few other teams, including his national side in the past, which will hold him in good stead in the MLC. To add to it, his calmness and level-headed nature is something that will rub on his teammates and help the team as a whole.\n\n#3 World-class death bowlers\n\nTSK have a set of death bowlers who are not only experienced but have a reputation of executing yorkers well more often than not. Gerald Coetzee is one of the most impressive prodigies going around at the moment and his form coming into the MLC has been impressive. That he was overlooked by the IPL teams was a massive shock for fans and pundits.\n\nDaniel Sams has a brilliant record in the death overs and has emerged as a wicket-taking option for all the teams that he plays for. He is currently a crucial member of Kent in the T20 Blast in which he has got the better of some of the best power hitters going around.\n\nThen, there is Dwayne Bravo who needs no introduction. He has been integral to the franchise's success in the IPL and the owners will hope for him to deliver in America as well. Rusty Theron just adds to their stocks. Therefore, they will be one of the most feared bowling line-ups in the tournament."

        "date": "Fri Jul 14 07:47:49 2023",
        "body": "Watch: A fielding violation prevented Texas Super Kings from dismissing Los Angeles Knight Riders’ Jaskaran Malhotra in the fifth over of the opening clash of the 2023 Major League Cricket.\n\nMalhotra survived after TSK were found to have one fielder fewer than the required number in the 30-yard circle during the fourth ball of the fifth over of LAKR’s innings. During the first six overs of each innings in a T20 game, only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle. TSK violated this clause and had three fielders outside the circle on the ball Malhotra was dismissed. He got a second chance, and the delivery was declared a no-ball instead.\n\nTSK were in the driver’s seat after posting 181-6 in the first innings and then had their rivals on the mat, at 34-4 in four overs. Malhotra attempted to break the momentum with a four and a six off consecutive balls in the fifth over before Calvin Savage dismissed the batter on the fourth ball.\n\nMalhotra played the length delivery with a flat bat to mid-on, where the fielder Rusty Theron latched on to an easy catch. Malhotra, however, immediately signalled that it was a no-ball, seemingly aware before the delivery itself that there was one fielder short of the inner circle.\n\nThe on-field umpires converged and signalled it a no-ball, as Malhotra survived, much to the frustration of TSK skipper Faf du Plessis.\n\nThe reprieve did not cost the Super Kings, as Malhotra added one more run to his tally, eventually falling for an 11-ball 22. Knight Riders were dismissed for 112 as Texas registered a mammoth 69-run win in the opener.\n\nWatch the incident here:"

        "body": "English players are in talks with MLC teams to be involved next year, and the Hundred is already impacted, with overseas players opting out of the draft to play in the USA\n\nThe Major League Cricket (MLC) organisers say there is \"no animosity\" between the league and the ECB, and are hoping that England's leading white-ball players will sign up for the second season of the league in 2024.\n\nMLC's inaugural season runs from July 13 to 30 and player salaries are highly competitive, with leading overseas players earning US$ 175,000 (£135,000 approx.) to play a minimum of five games.\n\nA number of England internationals held talks about playing in MLC through their representatives, though Jason Roy is the only active England player who will feature this season. The league takes place in the gap between the T20 Blast (barring Finals Day) and the Hundred, clashing with two rounds of County Championship fixtures and the final two Ashes Tests.\n\nRelated\n\nSunil Narine pulls out of Finals Day with Surrey to focus on Major League Cricket\n\nCricket's American dream takes flight - 'This season is about proving we can do it'\n\nSteven Smith in contention for Major League Cricket action in 2024\n\nSunil Narine's mission impossible: 75 hours, two continents, four games\n\nMLC: Teams, players, format, fixtures, and everything else you need to know\n\nThe ECB told centrally contracted players that they would not be given no-objection certificates (NOCs) to play that MLC and Roy requested a release from his incremental contract in order to take up his deal with Los Angeles Knight Riders, an affiliate of his IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\n\"We'd probably like a couple more of the [England] guys, to be honest,\" Justin Geale, MLC's tournament director, told ESPNcricinfo. \"But there are enough players to go around and we're certainly not here to start a war with anyone.\n\n\"It'd probably be a big ask for the red-ball, centrally contracted players but I think for some of the white-ball guys, there's a world where they come over for sure. It's not a huge tournament. We've certainly had an awful lot of interest from English players and we've had some positive engagement with them.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's what is good for the players as well. If they can supplement incomes while playing good cricket that is relevant for their careers, boards are generally okay with it. I couldn't speak on behalf of the ECB but I certainly don't think there's any animosity between us, or any 'we won't be releasing players, leave us alone' type thing.\"\n\nMoeen Ali confirmed last month that he has an offer - understood to be with Texas Super Kings - to play in MLC in 2024, and England do not have any white-ball internationals scheduled between the end of the men's T20 World Cup in June and their home series against Australia in September.\n\nMLC's launch has already had a direct impact on the Hundred, the ECB's 100-ball competition which is heading into its third season. While the leagues do not clash - the Hundred starts on August 1, two days after MLC's final - several overseas players pulled out of the Hundred draft after signing deals to play in the USA.\n\n\"There's a genuine curiosity about coming here, and it's not a bad place to come and tour, the US: they can bring their family or their golf clubs and stay on for a bit, so we haven't struggled there. The interest from players has been really good and there are some pretty star-studded line-ups\"\n\nJustin Geale, MLC's tournament director\n\nHigher salaries and the pull of IPL-affiliated teams mean the standard of overseas players in MLC is clearly higher, and with MLC expected to expand next year, the Hundred is clearly under threat. But Geale insisted, \"We're not here to compete with anyone.\"\n\nHe added, \"Players are really keen to come and have a look. There's a genuine curiosity about coming here, and it's not a bad place to come and tour, the US: they can bring their family or their golf clubs and stay on for a bit, so we haven't struggled there. The interest from players has been really good and there are some pretty star-studded line-ups.\"\n\nTwo Australian states, New South Wales and Victoria, have strategic partnerships with MLC and are running the Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns franchises respectively, and Geale said that English counties have also reached out to MLC organisers to discuss opportunities to become involved in US cricket.\n\n\"We've had a lot of interest from English counties who want to know more about the USA,\" Geale said. \"They're curious to know about New South Wales, Victoria and their partnerships. The dialogue has been really positive.\n\n\"We'd love to host some pre-season stuff out here. The weather is such around the country that you can play and I think there could be opportunities for teams to come out and play some matches in the USA - and to commercialise as well.\"\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98"

        "date": "Sun Jul 16 21:37:27 2023",
        "body": "GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas —The promise of cricket in America could be seen and felt in the most unlikely of circumstances.\n\nAwash in Friday night lights after a scorching Texas sun, the trim green cricket oval invited fanatics and families alike to watch the Seattle Orcas chase the Washington Freedom’s 144 runs.\n\nDeep in the Heart of Texas played cheerfully from the loudspeakers during a brief break in the action, and local law enforcement, sporting straw cowboy hats and boots, looked on in bewilderment.\n\nMajor League Cricket debuted last week, the cricketing world’s American Dream, a new field of dreams.\n\nUnlike the seesaw, to-and-fro of baseball innings, the format of cricket known as T-20 is played politely with one team batting until 20 overs (120 balls) are thrown – around the same number thrown by a baseball team in 9 innings.\n\nDuring a cricket game’s overs, the batting squad attempts to score as many runs as possible while the bowling team, the defense, attempts to take the batting team’s wickets. Batting ends when 10 wickets are taken or 20 overs are completed, whichever comes first.\n\nIn the opening innings, DC had scored 144 runs and lost seven wickets. Now it was up to Seattle’s assortment of Indian, Pakistani, South African, Sri Lankan, West Indies, and U.S. players to beat that score. Seattle displayed an offense not unlike past Mariners teams — slow but steady small ball.\n\nAfter eight overs, Seattle still needed 101 runs. With two overs remaining, they needed 17. Imad Wasim of Pakistan and Shimron Hetmyer from the West Indies formed a partnership that produced a pair of 6s (baseball’s equivalent of a homerun), and Shubham Ranjane came up with the winning hit for four (something like a ground rule double) after Hetmyer was dismissed.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas won their inaugural match Friday night with 148 runs and five lost wickets. They followed their thrilling victory with another win Saturday night over the San Francisco Unicorns, this time in a more decisive manner, 177 runs and four wickets. The Orcas took all ten San Francisco wickets after the Unicorns put up just 142 runs. Orcas batsman Heinrich Klaasen of South Africa scored the franchise’s first “half-century,” putting up 53 runs.\n\nIn 2015, I wrote an article seeking to answer a question: Could cricket in the U.S. be a worthwhile investment? I flew to New York City to watch a tour of the world’s cricketing all-stars because, having fallen in love with the sport thanks to business travel to India and England, I was curious about its viability in America.\n\nNot long ago, the idea that Major League Soccer franchises would pop up in cities across America, each competing for international talent, was a dream to some, and a joke to others. Cricket? It’s too complicated. Don’t matches stretch on for days? It will never work.\n\nBut might the MLC and the Indian diaspora attract a legend at the end of his career, like MLS and its “soccer is life” Latino population attracted Messi to Miami?\n\nThe night before Seattle’s match, the Texas Super Kings played the LA Knight Riders to commence tournament play. Ross Perot Jr.’s Super Kings beat the Knight Riders by a score of 181 runs and the loss of six wickets to 112 runs with the loss of all 10 wickets.\n\nThanks to an agreement with the Indian Premier League (IPL), several of the American teams share IPL mascots. Chenai and Texas are the Super Kings, Mumbai and New York are the Indians, Kolkata and Los Angeles are the Knight Riders.\n\nAll six teams — Texas, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. — began this week’s tournament in Texas, to be continued in North Carolina, and then return to Texas for the playoffs on July 27.\n\nThe scene in Grand Prairie\n\nMajor League Cricket debuted to a sellout crowd of around 7,000 fans with the kind of diversity the NFL, the NBA, and MLB can only dream about. Television networks from around the world, including America’s Willow cable channel, broadcast the game live to hundreds of millions in cricket-mad places like India, Australia and New Zealand, the U.K., and South Africa. International news outlets have run coverage almost hourly through the weekend.\n\nMLC took over an abandoned independent league baseball stadium (the Airhogs) in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, and invested heavily in a world class cricket oval. There, fans in Dallas Cowboys gear and Bass Pro Shop hats mixed with the national team jerseys from every cricket nation. Country and Western, Bollywood, and hip-hop blasted overhead. Fans munched on chickpeas and rice seasoned with Tex-Mex Chipotle hot sauce.\n\nThe Dallas metroplex made for a surprising backdrop. Looming over the new cricket stadium is Lone Star Park, a hulking horse racing venue. Soaring above the racetrack’s spire, commercial jets take off and land from nearby DFW Airport.\n\nInside the arena, an English gentleman from Birmingham, more recently residing in Jacksonville, stayed over in Dallas when he learned he could catch the first-ever Major League Cricket game.\n\nTim Miller, 54, and his son Iain, 18, live locally in the Dallas metroplex and were standing near the field an hour before the action began. Iain began playing with friends, mostly Indian, in a nearby park as the pandemic began. He fell in love with the game and has now tried out for an Under-19 team. He and his father watch cricket on Willow.\n\nMark Roberts and his kids, 10 and 13, drove 12 hours from Fort Collins, Colo., to see the launch. Dad took an interest in 2018 when he stumbled across the sport on Willow. He wanted to introduce his kids to cricket because “it’s a better alternative to baseball.” Why? The action.\n\nLike a winter league baseball game in the Caribbean, fans blew whistles and anticipated, and then reacted to, every play of the game.\n\nBy all accounts, the cricket grounds and the quality of play were top-notch. Likewise, the league clearly invested in slick, professional video and merchandise.\n\nCricket in the Pacific Northwest\n\nOrcas cricket is backed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Madrona Venture Group Managing Director S. Soma Somasegar; Icertis co-founder and CEO Samir Bodas; GreatPoint Ventures managing partner Ashok Krishnamurthi; and former Microsoft and Avalara executive Sanjay Parthasarathy.\n\nSoma and his family attended both Orcas games over the weekend.\n\n“Seattle was initially not a day 1 city for the league,” he said. “But because of the strong and vibrant fan base and sports community in Seattle we made Seattle a day 1 city for the league. We have an important fan base to build upon.”\n\nHe pointed out that the U.S. and Seattle should be part of the world’s second most popular sport.\n\n“Sports bring people from different perspectives together” he said. “ We want to unify.”\n\nTech hubs like Seattle and Silicon Valley in California have long attracted software programmers from India. The Asian Indian population in the U.S. has grown steadily, rising from 2 million in 2000 to more than 5 million.\n\nIn the Seattle area, Microsoft is incorporating a recreational cricket pitch on its new campus in Redmond. King County’s Marymoor Park, where Seattle’s amateur league has played for decades, envisions its own professionally-run stadium.\n\nWhat’s next for MLC?\n\nSeattle will play three more matches in Morristown, N.C., over the weekend. The teams return to Texas for the championship round.\n\nBeyond that, it’s a little uncertain.\n\nMLC franchises expect to have their grounds in order by the 2025 season. Tom Dunmore, who heads MLC marketing, said the hope is that 2025 will be the first regular season.\n\nNext year, the U.S. and the West Indies (Jamaica, Bahamas, Antigua) will co-host cricket’s World Cup. The International Cricket Committee (ICC), the equivalent of soccer’s FIFA, is currently working to identify host cities. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland are possibilities. With the Oakland Athletics heading to Las Vegas, that could open up a suitable stadium. The Oakland Coliseum is known for its generous foul territory, which would enable a proper cricket oval.\n\nDunmore says MLC will wait to see what the ICC comes up with, and perhaps next year’s MLC tournament could be played on a World Cup pitch.\n\n“Not to be cliché, but if you build it people will come,” Dunmore said.\n\nA little more on how the game is played\n\nIf you’ve played the game all your life, feel free to skip this. If not, read on. More than 10 years ago on a trip to New Delhi, I downloaded Cricket for Dummies in order to be conversant on the subject since the Australian national team was touring India. The test match, this one played over weeks, was all anyone wanted to talk about.\n\nLearning a little about the game helped. In Texas, some fans dressed in Jacob deGrom and Ronald Acuna Jr. baseball jerseys said they watched how-to videos on YouTube to get up to speed.\n\nHere’s a short lesson that might be helpful.\n\nAs in baseball, a batsman (batter) stands before a bowler (pitcher) and swings at pace balls (fastballs) and spin or swing balls (curves and sliders) attempting score runs.\n\nThe batsman can score 1-3 runs with hits inside the boundary (fence) or 4 runs at once if a fielder fails to stop the ball from exiting the boundary. If the batsman clears the boundary in the air, it’s 6 runs.\n\nWhat are wickets? Well, wickets are taken by the defense. The defense can take a wicket by catching the ball in the air, smacking the stumps behind the batsman or hitting the batsman’s leg pads without contact with the bat.\n\nA batsman can stand at the crease (like baseball’s plate) all day if the defense cannot take the wicket.\n\nWho wouldn’t like to watch Aaron Judge or Seattle native All-Star Corbin Carroll stand at the plate for the entire game because no one could get him out?\n\nFor further reading"

        "body": "Major League Cricket got underway in Texas on Thursday, and the most serious attempt yet to establish a domestic competition in the United States provided all the ingredients of a modern Twenty20 league.\n\nFans at the purpose built cricket stadium, just a 15-minute drive from Dallas Fort Worth airport, were decked out in the yellow shirts of the victorious home side, the Texas Super Kings, and were treated to the familiar sight of big sixes and non-stop action. The Super Kings won by 69 runs after making 181 for six and then bowling out the Los Angeles Knight Riders for 112.\n\nAny concerns that cricket in America might not be the real deal vanished when the action got underway and the crowd began cheering the big-hitting of the home team. The stadium previously belonged to the now defunct Texas Airhogs minor league baseball club, but since taking over the venue, MLC has spent over $20 million making it cricket-specific. For viewers watching the TV broadcast, it would have been hard to tell the difference between MLC and the other T20 tournaments that have sprung up around the world.\n\nAlso Read: PM Narendra Modi lauds 'Superhit' French striker Kylian Mbappe, says he's more popular in India than in France\n\nWith international players competing alongside domestic talent from the USA national team, the standard of play was clearly professional and the field and wicket looked up to scratch. That was in marked contrast to many previous, short-lived attempts to \"break the American market\" with one-off events in unsuitable venues, and was also light years away from much of the domestic cricket, which for years was played on matting tracks.\n\nTexas' South African bowler Rusty Theron was taken aback by the success of the opening game.\n\n\"I am actually a little bit emotional, to be honest. This is such a grand event. There was an unbelievable atmosphere and I want to thank each and every individual who has come out here,\" he said.\n\nSuper Kings batsman David Miller, who was awarded Player of the Match, for his hard-hitting 61 from 42 balls, including four sixes, was also impressed.\n\n\"It's fantastic to see such a great turn out and the facilities have been fantastic. I think there have been a few guys, kind of questioned around what it was going to be like but it shot the lights out here,\" said the South African, one of several players with a background in the world's top Twenty20 competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nMLC has backing from four IPL franchises including the Mumbai Indians, whose New York team began play on Friday. England opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams. Other games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\n\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom. The league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\n\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE\n\nYou can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community.

There are several cricket players that boast 2x the following of basketball legends like Michael Jordan. Yet the USA hasn’t historically been too keen on cricket.\n\nThe F1 Netflix Show \"Drive to Survive\" is a clear example of how growing your sport in the most consuming country in the world is a huge advantage. It brings more money, more eyeballs, more ad revenue and makes the sport more geographically diverse!\n\nKnowing all this, MLC attempted to do a proof of concept to show how to bring cricket to the USA!\n\nMLC got 3 of the biggest Indian cricket franchises to outright manage some of the teams to grow their own cricket expertise. As a segue, The Indian franchise cricket league has grown to the largest one in cricket and second richest league in any sport in the world, with each team having a valuation of over 1B dollars and the league raking in 19M $ per game.\n\nMLC allows 5 world-class international players per team to join the league and it was incredible to see them all travel and play in the Texas heat. They got world-class broadcasters and commentators for the matches too.\n\nIn mere 3 weeks they retro-fitted a baseball stadium into a cricket stadium in Dallas and had several games (including opening night) that were sold out with ~6000 fans! While there is more that needs to be done at the stadium it is commendable how quickly they made it!\n\nAs a semi-pro sportsman, it is wonderful to see sports working strategically to grow themselves and operate like tech companies! I am looking forward to seeing how MLC grows the sport, fan base and playing facilities in the USA"

At least that is the organizers' plan.\n\nThe sport actually already has something of a tradition in North America. Some might think that the oldest cricket rivalry is between England and Australia. However, that isn't actually the case. According to Tom Melville's 'A History of Cricket in America', before the Civil War, cricket was actually the most famous sport in the country.\n\nAn international contest took place in 1844 between USA and Canada and is known to be one of the earliest cricketing rivalries.\n\nMore than 175 years on, for a large chunk of the American population the sport of cricket is a puzzling question mark. Some people associate it with baseball, while others believe that the game is not fast enough to engage their interest. But what exactly is cricket and how is it played?\n\nHow does cricket work? Rules, format and everything to know\n\nEssentially, cricket is an often tense cat-and-mouse game between two teams of 11 players. The sport can be played in three formats: T20s, One-Day Internationals and Test matches.\n\nMajor League Cricket will be played in the T20 format, a variation that typically lasts for three to four hours.\n\nThe team batting first wants to score as many runs as possible by running between the stumps at each end of the pitch, or by hitting the ball hard — hard enough to fly over the fielders and beyond a rope at the boundary, to earn that team four runs (for crossing the boundary having bounced) or six runs (for crossing the boundary on the fly).\n\nA cricket pitch is the central rectangular strip between the wickets that is 22 yards long and 10 feet wide. And wickets are the three stumps placed at both ends of the pitch.\n\nThe aim of the game is to put a mammoth total on the scoreboard that will prove insurmountable for the opposition. Meanwhile, the bowling team is looking to keep the run total down by getting the batting team's batters out of the field as quickly as possible — either by hitting the wickets, catching the ball when it's been hit by a batter, or forcing the batter to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps directly by using their protective leg pads, rather than their bat (known as Leg Before Wicket, or LBW).\n\nIn T20s, like the MLC, each bowler gets four overs, and one over consists of six balls. Once all the balls have been bowled, or all the batters are out, the teams switch roles.\n\nOne-Day Internationals are similar, but each team has 50 overs, rather than 20, while Test matches are the longest format of the game and take place over five days, with both teams batting twice over two innings and their run total from both being combined.\n\nFrustratingly for some neutrals, Test matches can be played for five days and still end in a draw if one team has not won in that time!\n\nMORE: MLC 2023 results and matches\n\nMajor League Cricket format, rules and schedule\n\nWhile the way that cricket is played across the world is broadly the same, each specific competition can have slight variations on rules relating to rosters and the like.\n\nIn MLC, every team can have a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 19 players on its squad. Each roster will need to have one domestic Under-23 rookie player, to help promote cricket in the USA and develop future generations of American players.\n\nOn its complete roster, each team may have nine international players. However, no more than six of those players will be allowed in the playing 11.\n\nIn MLC, each team will play in the round-robin format against one another. The four teams that emerge on top of the points table will then qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe playoffs will include the Eliminator, the Challenger, the Qualifier and the Final. That Final will be played between the winner of the Qualifier and the Challenger on July 30.\n\nMajor League Cricket playoff schedule\n\nLots to take in? Don’t worry, MLC has got you covered.\n\nSpectators at the stadiums unaware of the rules will receive 'Cricket 101' flyers and get access to ambassadors who will help them understand the game, with the action taking place at the Grand Prairie stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina from July 13-30."

        "body": "As the pandemic got underway in earnest, in March 2020, Corey Anderson found himself 7,500 miles from home and a world away from the fame he’d known for much of his life. Back in Auckland, Anderson’s was a household name. He’d been a star on the New Zealand national cricket team ever since he’d set a world record for the fastest player to score 100 runs—a “century,” in cricket parlance—in a one-day match at just 21 years old. He’d spent the better part of a decade as a globe-trotting superstar, a hulking 6-foot-1, with the blond stubble and effortlessly tousled hair to pass for the Hemsworth brothers’ Kiwi cousin. He’d grown accustomed to being cheered on by tens of thousands from Mumbai to Barbados and, at his peak, pocketing more than half a million dollars for two months of work in the Indian Premier League, the world’s biggest and most lucrative franchised cricket competition.\n\nThen, just days before worldwide air traffic was grounded, Anderson flew from Auckland to Dallas, where his live-in American fiancée, Mary Margaret, was already visiting her mother in Highland Park. For the next nine months, he’d be cooped up in the guest room of his future mother-in-law’s house, acclimating to a life away from the game, stranded in a place where, he says, “cricket’s basically irrelevant for 99 percent of the country.”\n\nA part of him had been preparing for such a transition ever since he got serious with Mary Margaret, whom he’d met at a party four years earlier while on vacation in Croatia. During their courtship, he’d visited Dallas often enough to imagine a life for himself here, growing so fond of the city—the flat terrain, friendly people, and tree-lined streets reminded him of his hometown of Christchurch—that it came to feel like “home away from home.” But that was supposed to be well into the future, after his playing days ended. He’d turned 30 only a few months earlier; he imagined five, maybe six, more years of top-class cricket in front of him. And there was none of that to be found in Dallas—or anywhere else in the United States.\n\n“I knew in my head that I was going to move here at some point in time,” he says. “It just wasn’t yet.”\n\nIn the meantime, though, the borders were closed. He was stuck, with nowhere to play. So he may as well be of use. About six weeks after arriving in Dallas, he tracked down the phone number of Iain Higgins, then the chief executive of USA Cricket, and asked him two questions: what is the state of American cricket, and is there a way he could help?\n\nThe answer to the latter question, as it turned out, was he could. For 90 minutes, Higgins laid out a plan that, if successful, would change professional sports. As cricket surged to become the world’s second-most popular sport, the United States remained by far the largest market it had yet to penetrate, though not for lack of trying. In 2004, a domestic league called Pro Cricket lasted all of a season. A half-decade later, the American Premiere League was announced. It would take a dozen years, and the collapse of the governing body that sanctioned it, for any games to be played, at a far smaller scale than envisioned. But the national interest is there. Peter Della Penna, who covers the sport for ESPN’s English-language cricket site, says that the United States is neck and neck with the United Kingdom as the country providing the most web traffic, behind India. The domestic club scene is growing, too. One-off tournaments dot the country. But no one had ever blended fiscal might with the necessary cricket smarts to build a competition on par with the biggest franchised leagues in India, Pakistan, England, Australia, and the Caribbean.\n\nUntil now. Higgins told Anderson about an investment supergroup called American Cricket Enterprises, which had formed to create Major League Cricket, a six-team professional league that intended to succeed where everyone else had failed in the States. Four of the teams are backed by Indian Premier League clubs, who transformed cricket from stuffy to spectacle at a level unmatched by anyone else. Games would be played in July, a dead spot on the global cricket schedule, as well as the most wide-open time of year on the American sports calendar. There would be world-class stadiums, youth academies, and an accompanying minor league.\n\nAnd, oh, there was money—$120 million to be exact, after $44 million raised from Series A and A1 rounds plus $76 million in additional investment from the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who co-owns Major League Cricket’s Seattle Orcas, and Ross Perot Jr. and Anurag Jain, who are part of the ownership group of Texas Super Kings, the North Texas franchise. More than enough to lure premium talent across the Atlantic for a few weeks per year or persuade them to relocate full time in hopes of establishing a cricket culture that would help elevate the United States into a powerhouse. Do this right, and one day Major League Cricket could bully its way into the top handful of leagues in the world.\n\nThat is where Anderson came in. The following night, Major League Cricket co-founder Sameer Mehta delivered a proposal. What if Anderson accelerated his plan to relocate to the United States? Doing so would come at considerable cost. It would mean renouncing his eligibility for the New Zealand national team and changing residency to the United States, a three-year process that limited the number of days he could leave the country. Anderson’s earning potential would be slashed, too, at least as long as he had no international matches to play and a smaller window to compete in franchised competitions across the globe. He’d face long odds to compete on stages smaller than the ones he’d already graced.\n\nBut saying yes would give him a chance to matter in a way he never could as a cricketer alone. Anderson’s record for the fastest century had fallen a year after he’d set it. He would soon be replaced on the New Zealand team. “But if this can turn into what I think it could turn into, the legacy you create is way bigger,” he says. “Leaving a footprint on the game of cricket [instead of] just being a player who played the game and left the game.”\n\nBest of all, Anderson was already right where he needed to be. While Major League Cricket teams will eventually play in their home cities, which also include New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., only North Texas has a stadium that would be competition-ready out of the gate. For at least the first two years, the bulk of Major League Cricket matches will be played out of the newly renamed Grand Prairie Stadium. (A portion of this year’s games will also be played in Raleigh.) So, too, will a handful of matches in the 2024 T20 World Cup, which the United States will co-host with the West Indies. Perhaps even a match or two in the 2028 Olympics, which is considering adding cricket as a sport. Major League Cricket plans to install its headquarters in Grand Prairie Stadium, where its Australian physical performance coach, Burt Cockley, already resides with the intention of working out of the high-performance center scheduled to be completed next year. Players, drawn to the cheaper cost of living, plus being at the new hub of American cricket, are following. Setting down roots in Dallas would not only amount to a ticket home for Mary Margaret, who had moved to Auckland almost three years earlier, but it would also place Anderson at the epicenter of the most audacious American sports experiment since Major League Soccer was formed in 1993.\n\nSo Anderson signed on—and once he did, says Cockley, “it kind of showed this thing was real.” Now, three years later, Anderson will take the field as part of the San Francisco Unicorns, who selected him fourth in the league’s inaugural domestic player draft. In August, he’ll again captain the Dallas Mustangs, one of 26 teams in Minor League Cricket. He has become one of the league’s brightest faces and trusted ambassadors, and he remains steadfast in his optimism. As Anderson recalls telling Liam Plunkett, an ex-England international he helped recruit to the league, “This is kind of like being part of a startup. Do you want to get in now? Or would you want to wait three or four years and then go, ‘Damn, this thing took off. I’m now joining a bigger crowd to try and kind of find my way’? ”\n\nBut startups bust far more than they boom, and that’s especially true for startup professional sports leagues. Generations of suits have tried and failed to establish lucrative counterprogramming to Major League Baseball, from arena football to rugby. And none of them faced a challenge quite like Major League Cricket’s: to yank a sport buried in the American subculture into the mainstream, while it also attempts to reorganize how the game is played at the grassroots level.\n\nAll the necessary capital—financial, intellectual, athletic—is in place, which only heightens the urgency. Never before has this level of investment been poured into American cricket, which might make Major League Cricket the last, best chance for the sport to hit it big in the United States.\n\n“If this doesn’t work, it won’t work,” Cockley says.\n\nNorth Texas will be the proving ground.\n\nCricket is coming to North Texas​ for all the reasons you might guess. The centrally convenient location. The top-five media market. The thriving sports scene. Even the demographics. Della Penna characterizes cricket in America as “99.9 percent” Southeast Asian or West Indian expats; regional populations have ticked upward since the dot-com boom and surged over the last decade.\n\nBut Major League Cricket planted its flag here for one reason above all others: there was an empty shell for it to crawl into, to call home until it could, hopefully, someday, outgrow it. Consider Major League Cricket a sports-league hermit crab.\n\nAirHogs Stadium, across the road from Lone Star Park, has been vacant for three years. The independent-league baseball team it was named after played there from 2008 through 2020, but, toward the end, they were lucky to draw 1,700 fans in a night. After the Texas AirHogs went bust in 2020, Major League Cricket saw its opening.\n\nPerhaps Major League Cricket’s greatest impediment toward growing the game will be getting Americans to play it. The ideological challenge—how do we get people to care about our sport?—is no different from the struggle Major League Soccer faced 30 years ago, or the one Major League Rugby, which was founded in 2017, weathers today. Of course, cricket’s idiosyncrasies can be more complicated than those in soccer or rugby; a wicket, for instance, can refer to either the pitch the sport is played on or to a key piece of equipment on that field of play.\n\nLogistically, however, cricket’s plight is unique. The sport is intended to be played on dedicated turf wickets, not grass, which precludes it from sharing space with most of the courts, fields, and diamonds this country has built over generations. Unlike soccer pre-MLS, cricket isn’t played in American schools, which removes a crucial avenue for exposing young people to the sport and rules out the scholarship incentives that keep so many athletes (and their families) invested. That flattens the player base and thus the demand for school districts or parks and recreation departments to build those turf wickets where a grass field is cheaper and more widely used, to say nothing of bargaining power that nudges change along. As a result, most games around the country are played on concrete, a poor substitute for turf, given that the ball bounces more frequently and more predictably. The lack of proper turf wickets means the average American is not even playing the same sport as the rest of the world.\n\n“I had absolutely no idea what I was coming into,” says Andries Gous, a 29-year-old South African who signed on shortly after Anderson did and will play for the Washington Freedom. “I had no idea that the infrastructure was so far behind.”\n\nSo it should come as little surprise to learn that Major League Cricket’s six markets, with a combined population of 55.2 million people across their metropolitan areas, had zero existing venues suitable for high-level cricket. Building them all from the ground up would take years Major League Cricket didn’t have if it intended to be ready for 2023. But if it could create even one, the operation would have legs.\n\nThat made the shell of AirHogs Stadium quite appealing. First, repurposing the old stadium would generate far less red tape than constructing a new one from scratch. Better still, according to William Swann, Major League Cricket’s vice president of corporate development and infrastructure, using the old stadium cut the cost in half.\n\nThere was just the matter of overhauling it. For that, Major League Cricket turned to HKS and project leads Sergio Chavez and Greg Whittemore—an unusual challenge for the latter, a self-described football guy and soccer fan. “We didn’t grow up playing cricket,” Whittemore says, “and it’s been quite an education for us.”\n\nTo catch up, they mined what they could from their surroundings, from picking the brains of U.K.- and India-based colleagues to the lessons learned from the multiuse cricket-rugby stadium HKS designed in Perth, Australia. Then Whittemore and Chavez got to tinkering. They commissioned months-long studies to determine the correct rotation of the wickets to minimize glare when players switched sides. They designed a new lighting system to replicate the effect during night matches. Out went the old seating bowl and the kitschy outfield swimming pool. In came a moving screen positioned deep behind the bowler to replicate a batter’s eye in baseball. Capacity was adjusted to 7,221, with room to expand and accommodate thousands more for big events such as the World Cup. AirHogs Stadium became Grand Prairie Stadium, the temple of American cricket.\n\nNot all the baseball touches are gone, however. “We’re going to have—I constantly say this—the world’s only cricket ground in a baseball stadium,” says Major League Cricket tournament director Justin Geale. “It’s going to be a meeting of the worlds. It’s not ideally perfect in terms of sightlines and things like that for cricket. But it’s going to be a uniquely American cricket ground and experience.”\n\nIf that reads like boosterism, that’s the point. Because if there’s one thing everyone associated with Major League Cricket—brass, players, fans, media—agrees on, it’s that high-level cricket alone won’t sufficiently capture public interest. It must be American cricket, a blank slate of a term that Anderson believes is “going to be the biggest struggle” to define.\n\nAs for what passes for American cricket in 2023, according to Della Penna, “it’s basically adult males who grew up with cricket [overseas], are wildly passionate about it, and they’re trying to sustain that passion, that love, living in America, and that’s driven the quote-unquote growth and the quote-unquote investment in the cricket communities.” The problem is, that hasn’t come hand-in-hand with a grassroots setup capable of carrying that passion outside of their communities. The sport remains too insular to encompass much of the country it’s trying to represent.\n\nSlowly, this is evolving. Asif Mujtaba settled in Plano in 2006, after a long career with the Pakistani national cricket team, where he briefly served as vice captain. In 2011, he was recruited to start the Dallas Youth Cricket League, one of the dominant youth organizations in the region. Back then, he estimates, maybe 100 kids were playing cricket in North Texas. Now he puts the number at around 1,000—a big spike, but also a pittance compared to soccer, let alone more entrenched sports such as football, basketball, and baseball. Major League Cricket can solve for some of this. It is ramping up efforts to install hybrid wickets—part clay, part synthetic grass—around the country to improve playing conditions. There are 30 league-affiliated academies around the country, a number that figures to grow once Major League Cricket delivers proof of concept that it can polish unproven talents into batsmen ready for the big stage.\n\n“All the parents want this game to grow and [to know] that my kid has a future in the sport,” Cockley says. “There’s a system, there’s a pathway, and they’re just not a number in an academy paying $300 a month with no future.”\n\nWhat the league can’t address on its own is the need to go exponentially broader, both in numbers and diversity. For instance, women simply don’t play the sport. In its most recent annual general meeting in October, USA Cricket claimed a national total of 283 registered female players.\n\nThere’s also the matter of that microscopic 0.1 percent of players outside the Southeast Asian community.\n\n“The lazy argument that always gets made is ‘You say you want American, you just mean you want White people playing,’ ” says Della Penna. “Forget about White people. Are you going to find anybody who’s Black, or Mexican American, or Japanese American, whatever? Are they going to be playing? No.”\n\nThe solution may require a moment more than it does a road map, which is where the United States national team comes in. While Americans may be new to cricket, they’ve got a century’s worth of experience tuning in to support their country in international competition and making heroes out of the victors. Imagine if North Texans get a front-row seat in Grand Prairie to a Cinderella run from the Americans at next year’s World Cup. Better still, imagine that same scenario playing out at the Olympics in five years, when the United States stands to have a much deeper roster if Major League Cricket continues to buttress the domestic talent pool.\n\n“If somehow, gods help us, we win a medal, all of a sudden you’re sitting at The Tonight Show,” says Lovkesh Kalia, who emigrated from India to Dallas in 1989 and now owns the Dallas Mustangs, the Minor League Cricket team that Anderson captains. Then the dam bursts: more awareness, more stars, more fans, more lobbying power for cricket to get in schools and carve out dedicated spaces in public parks. “It won’t be just the Indians or Pakistanis going out there and asking for something,” he says. “It’d be the overall public asking for something, like it’s happening in soccer.”\n\nAll of that is bigger than Major League Cricket. It also depends on USA Cricket—an organization historically long on turmoil and short on funds—finding stable footing. It requires USA Cricket, which knows the lay of the land, seeing eye to eye with Major League Cricket, which has achieved so many things their American counterparts never have. All of that is independent of the other checkpoints, like the other five Major League Cricket organizations getting stadiums in their own cities, or those organizations cultivating fan bases patient enough to endure their teams possibly spending the next several summers in North Texas before they ever play a match at home.\n\n“It’s a long way to go,” says Mujtaba, the Pakistani international turned youth coach, “and it takes a lot of years.”\n\nBut just as startups fail more often than they succeed, venture capitalists, as a rule, hunt growth and profits. And while finally cracking the American cricket market remains the upside play, the low-hanging fruit for an organization deeply in business with the Indian Premier League is selling a lucrative overseas rights package to the gargantuan Indian market, with its seemingly boundless appetite for world-class cricket. Far more durable cricket scenes have succumbed to that economic pressure. The Caribbean Premier League, one of the world’s most vibrant franchised leagues, aligns half of its playing schedule with prime-time viewing hours in India. What happens if Major League Cricket, with only one local fanbase to cull from out of the gate, can’t even attract the requisite 7,000 spectators to fill Grand Prairie Stadium? What if it does, only to then go the way of the Caribbean Premier League when it staged neutral-site games over a three-year period in Fort Lauderdale? They drew 10,000 people initially and then plummeted to as low as triple-digit numbers by the end.\n\n“If that’s the route they want to go, then, you know, good luck establishing and embedding yourself in the community and making people in Texas actually care,” Della Penna says. “And then all the talk and all the philosophy about, ‘Oh, we really want to become part of the Texas community. We really want to make this really big in America’—that’s all nonsense.”\n\nIt would make Major League Cricket a global financial success but an American cultural failure. And the longer it takes for the league to achieve a foothold domestically, the more likely it seems that the money behind the effort will look for a short-term payoff over long-term impact.\n\n“Eventually, you’re going to have to make a decision,” Gous says. “That’s why it’s so important to get the American market into it. Otherwise, it’s going to happen.”\n\nUntil a few months ago, the great hope of American cricket was just another lanky college junior studying accounting at UTD’s Richardson campus. Twenty-year-old Ali Sheikh was preparing for a dependable office job after graduation. What was the sense in getting starry-eyed about cricket, his passion since he was a child in Doha, Qatar?\n\nFor the longest time, it didn’t matter that a global star like Mujtaba, his coach, spotted his talent at 13 years old in their first workout together. Or that Sheikh has gone on to captain the United States under-19 team. Or that a professional like Gous regarded him as “probably the best [player] under 23 in this country,” with his combination of slick fielding and endurance honed during a varsity soccer career at Lebanon Trail High School in Frisco. Cricket in America is a hobby, not a life.\n\nThen Major League Cricket came along. After a standout performance at the league’s pre-draft combine, Sheikh found himself in Houston for the inaugural draft, where, for what felt like hours, he sat and clapped politely, secure in the knowledge that no one would be calling his name as the draft shifted into the sixth round.\n\n“And then I hear [the announcer] go, ‘Ali Sheikh,’ ” he says, “and I’m like, Hold on, that’s me.”\n\nSuddenly there he was, shaking hands on a stage and donning the cap of his new team, the Los Angeles Knight Riders. He is no longer just another accounting major walking the campus at UTD. “People at school know me as ‘the cricket guy,’ ” he says, almost bashfully.\n\nBetween the local scene, Minor League Cricket (he’s a teammate of Anderson’s on the Dallas Mustangs), and now Major League Cricket, he’s making real money in the sport. His parents are encouraging him to take a gap year to focus on his game.\n\n“At the start, I felt like it couldn’t be a full-time job,” he says. “Now I feel like it could easily be a full-time job.”\n\nMajor League Cricket is counting on exactly that. If the league reaches its potential as a cultural force in America, it won’t be on the backs of players like Corey Anderson, vital as he is. It will happen because it minted a generation of American-born stars to rise through the ranks and stake their claim as faces of both the league and the United States national team, creating competition and representation along the way.\n\n“We need,” says Geale, the Major League Cricket tournament director, “literally another 10 Ali Sheikhs.”\n\nAnd why couldn’t it happen? For all Sheikh’s gifts and drive, Cockley, who has worked with him since Sheikh was 16, is quick to note that “he also benefited from being in the right time in history.” A time when the American cricketer suddenly has an endgame to aspire to and a pathway to achieve it. When in North Texas, especially, they’ll be surrounded by sharp minds and blossoming infrastructure and world-class talent to test their skills.\n\nSheikh has yet to play a match at Grand Prairie Stadium, but as Mujtaba says, “for the young people, he is an inspiration.” There is finally something, someone, to aspire to.\n\nWhich is why Major League Cricket’s first significant victory didn’t take place in a boardroom or with a player recruitment or during a groundbreaking ceremony, but on a phone conversation a few days after the Major League Cricket draft, between Kalia’s nephew, Bhavesh, and one of the Mustangs’ next stars, 17-year-old Rishi Ramesh. “I’m gonna get serious about cricket now,” Ramesh told the younger Kalia, so much so that, when it comes time for college, he’s considering online classes at UTD to give him the flexibility needed to train and compete.\n\nRamesh has a goal in mind, and if Major League Cricket’s vision takes root, he’ll be far from the only one. He doesn’t want to become an accountant.\n\n“I want to be the next Ali Sheikh,” he said."

        "date": "Thu Feb  8 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Major League Cricket, having surpassed its financial targets in a historic debut season, has unveiled its biggest signing for the fledgling competition hoped to lift the popular British Commonwealth sport to new heights in the coveted location of the U.S.\n\nAustralian cricket great Ricky Ponting has been announced as the new coach of Washington Freedom in a two-year deal that adds heft to the lucrative MLC, which lured a number of star international cricketers in its launch.\n\nSince his legendary career ended in 2012, Ponting has coached in the Indian Premier League and also been a well-regarded analyst on television in Australia, where he has showcased a knack for reading the play akin to Tony Romo's fortune-teller routine in the NFL.\n\n\"Cricket is really on the rise in the U.S. and I'm looking forward to being involved in Major League Cricket,\" Ponting said. \"I've been impressed by everyone involved at Washington Freedom.\"\n\nPonting adds gravitas to the league, which has a significant footprint from cricket powerhouses Australia and India. Cricket New South Wales has a \"strategic\" partnership with the Washington DC franchise.\n\nWashington owner Sanjay Govil said Ponting would help create \"a legacy of excellence in American cricket\". \"As we look to the future, it's clear that our ambitions require a figure of unmatched stature and expertise,\" he said.\n\n\"Ricky's legendary status, characterised by his leadership, winning mindset, and commitment to nurturing talent, aligns perfectly with our goals.\n\n\"His understanding of our vision - to enhance the sport's profile in the U.S. and to develop local talent - resonates with our mission.\"\n\nMLC is expected to expand and build from its successful debut season with more than 70,000 fans turning out to the 18-day tournament played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the rather modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThe broadcast was beamed to 87 countries worldwide and importantly some games were shown live on CBS Sports Network in the U.S.\n\nAs I reported late last year, the six-team tournament had revenues of around $8 million, which was higher than the anticipated figure of $5 million.\n\nDetails of the new season will be announced soon with organizers saying that the tournament will start on July 4 and finish by early August. That means the second edition of the MLC is set to be longer with owners hoping for a home and away format, where teams play each other twice, to eventually underpin the competition.\n\n\"The ownership group in the MLC would like the next season to be a full season, but scheduling will be important,\" Anand Rajaraman, San Francisco Unicorns co-owner, told me last September.\n\n\"It should last around a month and would need double headers, but hopefully not too many games played in the heat.\"\n\nMLC has helped start to change cricket's maligned perception in a country where the sport has struggled for relevancy and been riddled with internal turmoil.\n\nWith over $100 million invested, aided by influential Indian businessmen some of whom are ensconced in Silicon Valley, MLC has been able to compete financially with many of the other high-profile T20 competitions as cricket finally makes inroads into the world's biggest sports market.\n\nMI New York - owned by Mumbai Indians owner Mukesh Ambani - are the title holders. MLC's second season is set to start days after the T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S."

        "title": "Major League Cricket, game 1: Get to know the domestics for TSK and LAKR",
        "date": "Thu Jul 13 21:28:00 2023",
        "body": "It’s July 13 in sunny Dallas, Texas and that means it’s finally time for Major League Cricket. The inaugural game features Ali Khan and the Los Angeles Knight Riders against Rusty Theron and the Texas Super Kings at 7:30pm local time. The international stars of MLC are well known by cricket fans around the world, so let’s take a look at the domestics who live and play right here in the USA.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nOne of the things I love about this team is that their acronym is two letters shy of Lakers. That begs the question: Who is the Magic Johnson of the Knight Riders? This team is packed with an exciting variety of dynamic domestics. Let’s take a look at how each might factor into LAKR plans.\n\nAli Khan is the most internationally famous American product since Bart King at the turn of the 20th century. A veteran of the T20 franchise cricket circuit, Ali is also a major star for USA Cricket. Known by many as the “Yorker King,” Ali specializes in bowling the most difficult lengths for batters and consistently comes through in the toughest moments for his team. If Ali can claim wickets early, it will set the stage nicely for international stars Lockie Ferguson and Adam Zampa at the end of the power play and into the middle overs.\n\nJaskaran Malholtra almost certainly finds himself as the team’s wicket keeper, as no overseas options are included in the team. A world record holder, along with three others for smashing six consecutive sixes in an international over, Jaskaran is also featured in Jomboy Media’s ongoing Ball In Play League, an indoor hybrid of cricket and baseball designed in part to teach cricket to baseball fans.\n\nUnmukt Chand is well known for helping India claim the 2012 U19 World Cup, but his record in Minor League Cricket has shown that he still has a knack for winning big games. Unmukt captained the Silicon Valley Strikers to the championship in 2021 and back into finals weekend in 2022. Unmukt is also the career leader in runs for Minor League Cricket. It appears as if Unmukt will open the season in the playing eleven and serve as LAKR’s backup wicket keeper, should Jaskaran not perform.\n\nA fast bowling all rounder position will most likely be filled by a domestic as well, and LAKR have three strong options.\n\nSteady veteran Shadley Van Schalkwyk, a true all rounder for the Minor League Champion Seattle Thunderbolts, is the most balanced of LAKR’s options. Shadley possesses the experience and the mentality required to bowl reliably in the death, and would be a steadying presence in the late middle/early tail of the batting from the left side.\n\nCorne Dry brings a lot with the ball, as he’s shown for two seasons in Minor League Cricket leading the way for the South Division’s top team, the Atlanta Fire. The tall right arm quick can also put the ball into the seats with the bat.\n\nBhaskar Yadram is a true powerhouse with the bat, blasting sixes as far as you’ll see anybody hit them. With the ball, he almost bowls off of the wrong foot, but is effective and skillful. Though not the swiftest in the field, the U23 selection has a bright future ahead of him and is too talented to hold back for long.\n\nAlong with the splendid balance of Zampa and Narine, LAKR might want to add another spin option in their opening game against TSK. Luckily, they’ll have a good variety of spin styles to choose from domestically.\n\nUSA U19 all rounder Ali Sheikh’s tremendous performance in the draft combine resulted in his name being called before the U23 round, bringing attention to the young talent which abounds in the USA. Ali’s athleticism and effort in the field are difficult to match, and his left-arm finger spin bowling gives LAKR another bowler to trouble right handed batters.\n\nWith so many quality left handed batters in the TSK lineup, don’t be surprised to see Nitish Kumar in the team. The former Canadian Captain moved to Texas in 2021 and though his primary role is as a top order batter, Kumar is a solid right arm off spin option.\n\nTop order batter Saif Badar, who moved to the USA from Pakistan recently, could also be used as a legbreak option if LAKR opt for his bat in the team.\n\nGajanand Singh is coming off of his first ever ODI Century for USA, one of the few bright spots of the World Cup Qualifier tour. Gaj gives LAKR a left hand batting option in the middle of the order, and some handy off break bowling if needed.\n\nPredicted in the XI: Ali Khan, Jaskaran Malholtra, Unmukt Chand, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Nitish Kumar\n\nTexas Super Kings –\n\nEssentially playing at home, as well as being part of the most followed Franchise cricket brand in the world, TSK should have immense fan support at Grand Prairie Stadium on opening night.\n\nThe Super Kings first pick in the domestic draft, few cricketers enjoy the spotlight more than Rusty. While the pick surprised many, as Rusty has withdrawn himself from availability in recent tours for USA, it makes good sense when the brevity of the tournament and scarcity of quality fast bowling domestic options is taken into account.\n\nFast bowling all rounder Calvin Savage lives up to his surname in the T20 format. A knack for early wickets with the ball, Calvin sets up his slower ball well. As captain, Calvin led the unlikely Chicago Tigers to the Minor League playoffs in 2022, where the defending champion Silicon Valley Strikers needed all three games of the Conference Semifinal to knock them out. Calvin’s big bat is a major bonus and puts him in rare air among American all rounders. Along with Rusty and Jaskaran, Calvin also features in Jomboy’s Ball In Play League.\n\nPossessing perhaps the best gloves in the USA, wicket keeper Lahiru Milantha also brings a versatile, aggressive left handed bat to the TSK order. Able to take advantage in the power play, or finesse and punish spinners in the middle overs, Lahiru never looks outmatched by pace or spin.\n\nSkillfully finding gaps, especially to the off side and behind point, Sami Aslam’s batting more closely resembles swordplay than the violent ball bashing that dominates T20 cricket. But when he’s unburdened by the responsibility of leading a team, Sami’s scoring rate climbs and his talent for the format shines.\n\nWill TSK play both of these talented left handed batters, or will opt for a right handed domestic batter to balance out the order, considering LAKR’s versatile and varied bowling attack?\n\nMilind Kumar was one of the top performers in the East division of Minor League Cricket in 2022. Able to accumulate and score quickly, Milind can bat in the middle overs and handles spin bowling very well. He also provides TSK the option for right arm off break with the ball, if necessary.\n\nCody Chetty brings versatility from the right side to TSK, as he can bat at the top or middle order. Though he doesn’t bowl often at higher levels, he can provide an over or two of off break bowling if needed.\n\nWith the recently announced arrival of legbreak legend lImran Tahir, and Mitchell Santner already in the roster, the question of how many domestic spin options TSK include is an interesting one.\n\nBy taking Mohammad Mohsin in the recent “wildcard” domestic draft, TSK could be signaling the desire to double down on spin that turns away from right handed batters.\n\nZia Shahzad was taken in the initial domestic draft, an all rounder who is possibly the top right arm legbreak spin bowler in the country, and so the edge would logically go to him to start the tournament. Shahzad should gain eligibility to play for USA this year.\n\nConsidering the inclusion of Dwayne Bravo, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee as overseas in the roster, it seems unlikely that right arm fast medium bowler Cam Stevenson would be in the same eleven along with Calvin and Rusty. But that doesn’t mean Stevenson won’t be included in place of one of his domestic teammates. Cam has been reliable in his role with USA cricket and has experience in T20 franchise in the BBL.\n\nAnd that leaves Saiteja Mukkamalla. There is perhaps no better young batting prospect in the country than TSK’s U23. USA Cricket’s youngest centurion, Sai is mature beyond his years and opened the batting for his New Jersey Stallions on their way to back to back finals weekend appearances in 2021 and 2022.\n\nPredicted in the XI: Rusty Theron, Calvin Savage, Lahiru Milantha, Zia Shahzad, Milind Kumar\n\nHow to watch"

Preparations are underway to dazzle fans with the second season of America's premier T20 cricket tournament, which is set to run through early August. The MLC, keen on capitalizing on the buzz from its successful maiden season, has not yet released the full schedule but promises the dates and details will unfold early next year.\n\n\"The tremendous success of the inaugural Major League Cricket season provides a perfect platform to propel American cricket to even greater heights in 2024,\" Justin Geale, Tournament Director, said. Geale's hit on a sentiment that echoes throughout the cricketing community, which has often been overshadowed by America's more traditional sports leagues, according to the City of Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nAs American sports fans gear up for tailgates and touchdowns, Major League Cricket is batting to become a new summer mainstay. With the impetus of an eagerly anticipated ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the MLC aims to enthrall audiences with a lineup of even more world-class players this upcoming season. This ambitious follow-up year is pegged as the summer spectacle for both longtime cricket enthusiasts and those new to the sport in the States."

        "body": "Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) will be part of the first-ever Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023 clash as they take on Texas Super Kings (TSK) in the tournament opener at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday, July 13. The six-team event also features Seattle Orcas, Washington Freedom, MI New York, and San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nRecently, West Indies and Kolkata Knight Riders’ (KKR) spin-bowling all-rounder Sunil Narine was named captain of the Los Angeles Knight Riders. Former West Indies batter Phil Simmons has been appointed as head coach, while Bharat Arun will be the bowling coach, Ryan Ten Doeschate the assistant coach, and AR Srikkanth the team analyst.\n\nApart from Narine, explosive England opener Jason Roy, New Zealand batter Martin Guptill, South African left-handed batter Rilee Rossouw, Kiwi pacer Lockie Ferguson and Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa are some of the prominent international players in the Los Angeles Knight Riders squad.\n\nAs LAKR gear up for their opening MLC 2023 clash, we pick the best playing XI for the franchise for the tournament.\n\nOpeners: Jason Roy and Unmukt Chand\n\nJason Roy should open the innings. He has a terrific record in T20 cricket and plenty of experience as well. In 323 matches, he has smashed 8473 runs at an average of 28.05 and a strike rate of 142.14, with six hundreds.\n\nOn his day, he can be the most explosive batter in the business. Roy was among the few positives for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2023. In eight matches, he smacked 285 runs at a strike rate of 151.60.\n\nFormer India U-19 captain, Unmukt Chand will feature in MLC 2023 as a domestic player. He has not been in great form lately but has the experience of 84 T20 games, scoring 1637 runs at a strike rate of 114.87.\n\nGiven the six overseas players limit, Martin Guptill is likely to miss out.\n\nMiddle-order batters: Rilee Rossouw, Gajanand Singh, and Jaskaran Malhotra (wk)\n\nRilee Rossouw had an inconsistent run for Delhi Capitals (DC) in IPL 2023. He scored 209 runs in nine games. However, he did show glimpses of brilliance during his scintillating 82* off only 37 balls in a game against Punjab Kings (PBKS). Los Angeles Knight Riders will expect similar knocks from him.\n\nGajanand Singh is a middle-order batter and is likely to occupy one of the domestic batting slots. He has played 22 T20s, scoring 314 runs at a strike rate of 118.93. Gajanand is also a part-time off-spinner, who can chip in if needed.\n\nAnother USA cricketer, Jaskaran Malhotra can be the keeper-batter in the Los Angeles Knight Riders playing XI. He has played 17 T20s, scoring 267 runs in the process.\n\nAll-rounders: Andre Russell and Sunil Narine (c)\n\nThe West Indies duo of Andre Russell and Sunil Narine will look to reprise the significant roles they perform for KKR.\n\nOf course, there will be additional responsibility on Narine, having been named captain of the team. Going through their numbers would be a pointless exercise since it’s a known fact that the duo are among the most experienced T20 cricketers of the current generation.\n\nRussell will be keen to play some destructive knocks and win games for the LAKR franchise. Narine will also look to utilize his bowling skills at the death. The skipper himself will be expected to deliver the goods with the ball apart from chipping in with the willow as and when needed.\n\nBowlers: Shadley van Schalkwyk, Ali Khan, Lockie Ferguson, Adam Zampa\n\nShadley van Schalkwyk and Ali Khan can be the two domestic players in the Los Angeles Knight Riders bowling line-up.\n\nVan Schalkwyk, 34, will offer a right-arm pace option. He has the experience of 94 T20s in which he has claimed 90 wickets at an average of 25.72.\n\nAli is also a right-arm pace bowler, who has picked up 53 scalps in 49 games.\n\nFast bowler Lockie Ferguson and leg-spinner Adam Zampa can be the overseas bowling options.\n\nFerguson has delivered some fantastic performances in the IPL as well as for New Zealand although his consistency remains a question mark.\n\nAs for Zampa, he is a highly underrated bowler, who is a proven match-winner with the ball in hand."

All are based in Grand Prairie.\n\n“July 13, 2023, is going to be somewhat historic,” said Marty Wieder, Grand Prairie director of economic development. “We can become Cricket City, USA.”\n\n‘This has got legs’\n\nMajor League Cricket faces an uphill battle with few venues in the U.S. and low participation at the youth and amateur levels, where interest in the sport is fostered.\n\nThe sport’s U.S. governing body, USA Cricket, also faces financial difficulties and has yet to name a CEO after multiple leadership departures. It’s put the organization in continued conflict with cricket’s global leaders.\n\nSports leagues in general are hard to start, especially in a country with no recent history with cricket.\n\nThe sport has been played for centuries in England, and international events have boosted its commercial potential in Commonwealth countries. But the U.S. has rarely been good enough to qualify for international events like the World Cup that would have put the sport on Americans’ minds, as men’s and women’s World Cups did for soccer.\n\nAnd pro cricket doesn’t have school sports participation to build on like other upstart leagues such as Major League Soccer and the Premier Lacrosse League.\n\nRelated:Flights are getting cheaper as summer travel season ramps up\n\nProfessional cricket supporters aren’t expecting to challenge the nation’s more established sports overnight.\n\n“Major League Cricket has been very cautious and very conservative,” Wieder said. “We’ll see in this first year, economically, what kind of impact it’ll have. We know it’ll be better than what we had when we had independent baseball.”\n\nMajor League Cricket does have some things in its favor. What Americans would think of as professional cricket, usually called franchised cricket, is relatively new globally. The Indian Premier League, now one of the biggest sports leagues in the world, was started in 2008. Popular leagues in other countries began even later.\n\n“When I first came in and started talking about … cricket, I think [my previous city manager] really shook his head and wondered about me,” Wieder said. “But I think he even realizes, yeah, this has got legs. This is going to be big for Grand Prairie.”\n\nMinor League Cricket, a developmental league, has already played two seasons, and the U.S. has already been chosen to co-host the 2024 T20 World Cup with the West Indies. Some of those matches are expected to be played in the newly converted stadium.\n\n‘A way of life’\n\nThe Indian Premier League is by far the most popular venue for cricket, earning nearly $17 million per match, the third-most of any sports league in the world. Its opening match this season garnered 130 million viewers, more than the 2023 Super Bowl.\n\nThe sport’s popularity is mostly concentrated in Commonwealth countries made up of the United Kingdom and its former colonies. It’s the dominant sport in nations such as India, Pakistan and Australia and an estimated billion people watched India and Pakistan play in the 2015 World Cup.\n\n“Cricket is not just a sport,” the investor Jain said. “Cricket is a way of life.”\n\nCricket has been played in the U.S. as far back as the Revolutionary War. But in the late 1800s, it lost the battle to baseball as America’s favorite bat-and-ball sport.\n\nA wave of South Asian immigrants in the 1990s brought their appetite for cricket with them to the United States.\n\nMajor League Cricket co-founders Sameer Mehta and Srinivasan capitalized on that and created one of the world’s first subscription sports live-streaming sites: Willow.tv in 2002. In 2010, the service expanded to a satellite TV station, and then to cable in 2012, using a subscription model like HBO or NFL Network.\n\nIn 2016, they sold the station to the Times Group, an Indian media conglomerate.\n\n“We were reaching a few million households,” Srinivasan said. “And we had realized that in broadcasting cricket to an audience here in the U.S., for so many years, one of our biggest frustrations was that we had never actually broadcast any matches that happened in the U.S.”\n\nMeanwhile, after tumult regarding its predecessor as the U.S.’s sanctioning cricket body, USA Cricket solicited proposals to bring cricket to the states.\n\nLovkesh Kalia, a Dallas-area hospitality businessman and former board member of USA Cricket’s predecessor, contacted Grand Prairie’s economic officials. Kalia said Grand Prairie could become the hub for cricket in the U.S.\n\nAfter identifying Grand Prairie as home base, Srinivasan and Mehta, under the banner of American Cricket Enterprises, sent their proposal to USA Cricket. The group would create Major League Cricket, but not without the proper support: funding cricket infrastructure across the country, a development league that came to be Minor League Cricket, and cultivating interest among Americans.\n\nAccording to Srinivasan, 20 groups sent proposals, and six were chosen as finalists. What placed the Texas group and their proposal for Major League Cricket above the rest was the duo’s experience with Willow.\n\n“We had a lot of data relative to cricket live audiences, what are the strongest markets in the U.S., and so on,” Srinivasan said.\n\nThe proposal was attractive to investors, too. American Cricket Enterprises has raised $44 million, including backing from Jain, Ross Perot Jr. and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who all joined as team owners or co-owners. Jain and Perot are co-owners of the Texas Super Kings, Dallas-Fort Worth’s hometown team.\n\nIn 2021, after being granted USA Cricket’s exclusive sanction, American Cricket Enterprises partnered with Grand Prairie to redevelop Grand Prairie Stadium into a cricket field.\n\n‘Perfect collision’\n\nPrevious attempts at professional cricket such as Pro Cricket and the American Premier League used minor league baseball stadiums without making them true cricket grounds.\n\nFew cities in the U.S. have stadiums equipped to handle cricket, with its unique round field.\n\nThen came Grand Prairie. The Texas AirHogs, which played in the non-MLB-associated American Association, struggled to fill its stadium’s 7,000 seats, with average attendance hovering around 1,000. The team officially folded in 2020, leaving the stadium vacant.\n\nAfter securing the use of the venue, the Major League Cricket group set out to turn Grand Prairie Stadium into the U.S.’s premier cricket ground.\n\n“It’s a lot of stress if you’re me,” said Will Swann, vice president of corporate development and infrastructure and the league’s first hire tasked to redevelop the former minor league baseball field.\n\nThe cricket league started work on the stadium retrofit in July 2022, tearing down stands to accommodate the regulation cricket field and then adding more seating to bring it back to its 7,000-person capacity.\n\nAll the prior “vertical architecture” is there — suites, concessions, team areas and the sports bar in the outfield — which was the value of renovating an existing stadium in the first place, Swann said.\n\nMajor League Cricket spent $20 million on the project. The final product is a uniquely American cricket experience that blends some of the conventions of baseball stadiums with a much different sport.\n\n“It’s almost the perfect collision of cricket and baseball,” said Swann, who was born and raised a cricket fan and player in Australia.\n\nMost of the seats are concentrated in the pavilion area. The field is closer to the stands than it would be had it not been a converted ballpark.\n\n“If you’ve ever been to a minor league baseball game, you get to be really up close and personal,” Swann said. “And imagine that kind of feeling except you have the best players in the world walking out to play.”\n\nFor the players, too, it’ll be “pretty phenomenal,” he said. Major League Cricket has 26 to 30 cameras capturing each broadcast at the stadium, giving the broadcasts unique views that haven’t been available to the sport before.\n\nSingle-game tickets in Grand Prairie start at $24.\n\nThe other venue hosting games this summer outside Raleigh, N.C., seats just over 3,000. Grand Prairie Stadium will be the league’s primary stadium until all six teams can build venues. The league is also building a training field nearby in North Texas that’s expected to be ready before next year’s T20 World Cup.\n\nRelated:UT-Dallas student Ali Sheikh highlights the rise of cricket in Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nGrassroots movement\n\nThe Dallas area was attractive as the seat for American cricket for a variety of reasons. Dallas has one of the country’s largest airports, DFW International Airport, and year-round warm weather. Jain also cited Dallas’ love of sports as a reason to invest time and money into bringing a cricket league here, especially with Dallas’ large investment community.\n\n“We just get stuff done in Dallas,” Jain said.\n\nThe league has offered discounted tickets to local amateur players and worked with youth academies on special nights for them. Some local players were drafted in the upstart league to form a relationship with the community such as University of Texas at Dallas junior and accounting major Ali Sheikh.\n\nEach Major League Cricket team is also partnered with established teams overseas. The Texas Super Kings are paired and named after the Chennai Super Kings in southern India, “the Manchester United of cricket,” as Jain put it. League executives are also counting on fans in India to tune in as they do with the Caribbean Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League.\n\nSrinivasan also knew from running Willow that there was a large base of people in Dallas who wanted to watch cricket. Dallas-Fort Worth has one of the largest South Asian communities in the country, with more than 212,000 Asian Indians alone in North Texas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That’s the fourth largest of any metropolitan area in the country. Many are cricket fans and play on Dallas’ numerous club and rec teams. There are also youth academies across the city.\n\nShreyas Viswanathan, a college freshman at Purdue University and Dallas resident, played in those academies and said he knew many people who moved to Dallas just to pursue cricket. Now, he runs The Cricket Chronicle blog and says he is one of thousands of local cricketers who are excited about Major League Cricket and ready to support it.\n\nSherwin Fernandes, another local cricketer and fan, said there has been a buzz in the community for the start of the season because of the chance to finally see some of the best cricketers live.\n\n“The who’s who of cricket is in the MLC,” Fernandes said."

        "title": "Major League Cricket Seeks to Grow Sport in America, Seattle Franchise Included",
        "date": "Wed May  3 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) represents the newest bid at growing the United States’ market for the internationally popular sport. Starting with a six-team format and a 19-day season this July, the MLC will host games exclusively at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest will be a part of the league, which was founded in 2019, as the Seattle Orcas were unveiled in March. In turn, they will provide a major league companion to Minor League Cricket’s (MiLC) Seattle Thunderbolts. Among the team’s owners are the GMR Group and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. They are backed by the Indian Premier League’s (IPL) Delhi Capitals, who are also owned by GMR. Other teams in the MLC will be based in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas, Washington D.C. and New York.\n\nJagan Nemani, head of technology and junior programs for the MLC and one of the overseers of the Orcas, emphasized the excitement around cricket and willing benefactors as essential to Seattle landing a team.\n\n“We were basically in a race against Chicago,” Nemani said, as the rival city already had two minor league teams. “We beat them to it because we were able to find not only a good pedigree of investors, [but] a growing community… as well as, you know, a good place where [the Orcas] could call home.”\n\nThat home will be at Marymoor Park in Redmond, Washington, where the team plans to build a 6,000-occupant stadium and public cricket ground—tentatively named Marymoor Community Cricket Park. The MLC is still working with King County to iron out the details of the grounds as the team will not play in Redmond for at least another year.\n\nIn terms of the league itself, the player composition in the MLC and in the international cricket scene is unique compared to predominantly American sports, like American football, where athletes play year-round for a single league. Twenty20 (T20) leagues—the type of quicker style of cricket that will be played in the MLC—rarely run for longer than two months. Professional cricketers often play in upwards of 12 leagues per calendar year, including national team play. This means there is no shortage of elite talent for the MLC to acquire, as top players are always looking for a new opportunity to join a league.\n\nThe MLC capitalized on that opportunity by first picking July for their season, as no other major T20 league will be playing at that time, according to Nemani. This will allow for players who usually play overseas in other major leagues, like the IPL’s Mitchell Marsh, to join the MLC for the season.\n\nHarmeet Singh, the first overall pick in the MLC’s recent player draft and former captain of the Seattle Thunderbolts, has confidence in the talent the league has already drawn and domestic players it could produce. Singh has played in the U.S. since 2020 and coached youth players at various academies across the country. Thanks to that experience, Singh is optimistic for cricket’s future domestically.\n\n“I think [the MLC] will be one of the better leagues around the world once it takes off, because the talent is there,” Singh said. “It’s just the talent did not have the right path. I think this is a system that we were lacking—now we have a minor league system and then we have a major league setup.”\n\nDue to the league’s short seasons, Nemani noted that the stadium’s grounds will be available for public use for a limited number of hours per week. This availability will give Redmond its first public cricket ground and provide one of the only such facilities in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nRedmond locals, like Ananth Iyer, a lifelong cricket fan and second-year chemistry major at Carleton College, were thrilled to hear of the possibility of getting such facilities in the town.\n\n“[We were] pretty much just using turf soccer or baseball fields and repurposing them to play cricket with incorrect field dimensions, because that was all we really had,” Iyer said of his time playing youth cricket in Redmond. “I feel like it’ll be a great investment that a lot of people would use.”\n\nThe MLC has also taken steps to develop the next generation of domestic cricketers. Nemani coordinates the MLC Junior Championship, a youth cricket tournament which has grown substantially over the past two years and will host 1,500 children from over 100 teams in Atlanta at the end of May.\n\nNemani also runs the league’s academy system, which provides facilities and coaching for youth players across the country.\n\n“We are developing the cricket ecosystem,” Nemani said. “So basically we have a very holistic approach in terms of developing cricket in this country, and we work with many different facets to make sure it’s happening.”\n\nThe MLC’s approach to growing cricket in the U.S. is an interesting one. With short-term plans to host a season this year while developing youth players in the long-term, it will take decades to truly gauge the league’s success. Providing the nation’s only major league platform for sport appears to be only the first step."

        "body": "This story is from July 12, 2023\n\nWith its own Major League, cricket looks for a foothold in the United States\n\nThe MLC will comprise six teams, from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, New York and Washington, which will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\n\nWELLINGTON (New Zealand): George Bernard Shaw asserted “the English are not very spiritual people so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.”\n\nIt has been a long game, traditionally.\n\nWhile cricket has flourished in England and some of its former colonies, it has never taken off to the same degree in the United States , where some have perceived it as impenetrable.\n\nA sport played in its purist form by players in long white uniforms, test cricket goes on for five days and still often ends with no winner, with days so long players twice have to leave the field for meals.\n\nMajor League Cricket , which begins July 13, could change that perception. For a start, the games only go for just over three hours.\n\nThe MLC will comprise six teams, from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas , New York and Washington , which will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\n\nTeams will have a maximum of 19 and minimum of 16 players, combining international stars and home-grown players selected through a draft which was made when the league was launched, officially and metaphorically, at Space Center Houston. Each team was allowed to sign nine local players, one of which had to be under-23.\n\nThe salaries of international players will be drawn from an initial $120 million investment from corporate backers, mainly from India.\n\nThe teams will play the Twenty20 style which might be portrayed as cricket with the dull bits removed. The format may be more appealing to the American sport palate because there is always a winner: if the teams are still tied after both innings — each comprising 20 six-ball overs — a tie-breaking “super over” is played to find the winner.\n\nMost matches will be played at the Grand Prarie Stadium near Dallas, converted to a cricket stadium with 7,200 seats and a grass pitch. Other matches will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThe league follows the model of professional Twenty20 — or more broadly known as T20 — leagues which already exist in places such as India, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Canada. They're all supported by a travelling troupe of international players — many of them T20 specialists — who give leagues marquee quality.\n\nThe most lucrative and glamorous of all these franchise competitions is the Indian Premier League, where the world’s best players are hired by teams owned by Bollywood stars, business giants and other celebrities. The gravitational pull of the IPL has reshaped cricket’s traditional schedules and made many new cricketing millionaires.\n\nMajor League Cricket inevitably will have some of the Indian Premier League glitz. Four of the six teams are owned and will be run by IPL Franchises.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders will be run by the Knight Riders Group which operates the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. MI New York will be run by the Mumbai Indians, Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas by the GMR Group which runs the Delhi Capitals.\n\nTwo of Australia's provincial organizations — Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales — will run the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom respectively.\n\nMany of the biggest stars from India, Australia and England are involved in test series — more of those five-day matches — but the MLC has attracted a strong contingent of seasoned T20 performers.\n\nBollywood star Shah Rukh Khan co-owns the Knight Riders Group and has recruited West Indies stars Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, England’s Jason Roy, Rilee Rossouw of South Africa, Australian Adam Zampa and New Zealanders Lockie Ferguson and Martin Guptill.\n\n“We have assembled a strong and talented team for the debut season of MLC who can compete at the highest level and bring joy to cricket fans around the world,” Knight Riders Group chief executive Venky Mysore said.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have hired South Africa’s Faf du Plessis as captain alongside international stars Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, David Miller, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee.\n\nChennai Super Kings chief executive K.S. Viswanathan said du Plessis “led the Joburg Super Kings at (the South African T20 league) from the front earlier this year and we’re confident of doing well under him in Texas as well.\"\n\nThe West Indies and Mumbai Indians star Kieron Pollard will captain New York, which will have Robin Peterson as head coach and Lasith Malinga as bowling coach. Their signings include fast bowlers Trent Boult from New Zealand and Kagiso Rabada from South Africa.\n\nSeattle has Australian star Mitch Marsh and South Africa’s Quinton de Kock.\n\nThe MLC has broader ambitions, to build minor leagues in a bid to develop training and development facilities and support the U.S. national team.\n\nNow it remains to be seen whether American fans will find Major League Cricket to their taste and make the league itself everlasting.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"

        "body": "The countdown has started for a new T20 League. Major League Cricket will have its first edition in July this year. The draft for the domestic players will happen on March 19th in the USA (March 20th in India). Here, we take a look at the TV broadcast and the live-streaming details of the Major League Cricket 2023 Draft.\n\nFour of the six franchises in the league will have stakes owned by IPL Team Owners. The franchises which have invested in MLC are Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and Chennai Super Kings. Hence, the Indian fans will also be excited about the tournament and hence, the draft.\n\nThe draft for domestic players will involve some popular cricketers, too. As we all know, a few players had left their birth nations to pursue a career in the USA. Some of the popular names are Unmukt Chand, Corey Anderson, Smit Patel and Liam Plunkett, amongst others. MLC will be a domestic T20 league. Each franchise can have a maximum of seven overseas cricketers. As per reports, the franchises can make the overseas hirings as direct signings and may not have to go through the auction or draft route.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich TV Channel and OTT platform will telecast Major League Cricket 2023 Draft in India, USA, UK, Pakistan, Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand?\n\nAs per the current news, there is no information on the TV Telecast of the Draft across the globe. The same is the update with respect to OTT-specific digital streaming, too. However, the official handle of MLC has confirmed that the draft will be streaming live on the official YouTube Channel – MLC Network. Jio Cinema and Sports 18 will bring the action from the draft in India.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen will Major League Cricket 2023 Draft start?\n\nThe Space Center Houston will host the historic draft.

        "body": "Z is for Zampa. Z is also for zany. Australian cricket star Adam Zampa has attracted instant headlines for America’s fledgling Major League Cricket competition - and it had nothing to do with what he did with bat or ball.\n\nThe extroverted Aussie leg spinner instead caused a storm with his choice of number on the back of his LA Knight Riders’ playing shirt. Zampa opted for number 420 - presumably as a reference to marijuana - for the match against the Texas Super Kings.\n\n'SURPRISED': Alex Carey's telling response to Jonny Bairstow Ashes outrage\n\nCLASSIC: Mitchell Starc's hilarious Alyssa Healy reveal amid Ashes battle\n\nHUGE: Michael Neser puts Ashes selectors on notice in astonishing feat\n\nThe origins of 420 are a little murky, with one suggestion it was the police radio call used for any dope related offence in the US. Another explanation is it’s the room number the Grateful Dead insisted on staying in during their touring days.\n\nA more plausible reason is it’s the codename a bunch of schoolboys gave their group in 1971 after discovering a marijuana crop in San Francisco. The boys would meet after school at 4:20pm, hence the tag.\n\nEvery year around the world, marijuana enthusiasts meet on April 20 (4/20 on the American calendar) to celebrate their love of weed and push for its decriminalisation. Zampa has not publicly declared why he chose shirt number 420 but fans have decided it’s his way of bringing a bit of life and colour to the American tournament.\n\nAdam Zampa shirt number takes internet by storm\n\nIt certainly became a major talking point. Fans from around the cricket world took to social media to speculate about Zampa’s motives for using 420.\n\nAdam Zampa remains one of cricket's quirkiest characters\n\nThe 31-year-old has long done things his way, refusing to conform to cricket’s straight-laced ways. He lives on a farm on the NSW far north coast - away from the major cricketing centres - and long ago adopted a vegan diet.\n\nHe is passionate about environmental and social issues and a keen advocate for animal welfare. Now it appears he is lending his support to another popular cause.\n\nZampa’s LA Knight Riders are co-owned by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and boast premier West Indian players Sunil Narime, Andre Russell, South African Rilee Rossouw and New Zealander Lockie Ferguson among their playing ranks."

        "body": "Former CSK batter's decision comes even as BCCI proposes year-long cooling-off period for retired players before they can join overseas T20 leagues\n\nAmbati Rayudu has withdrawn from the inaugural edition of USA's Major League Cricket, where he was to represent Texas Super Kings. This follows the BCCI's proposal to introduce a year-long cooling-off period for retired players before they can participate in overseas T20 leagues. The proposal, put forward at Apex Council meeting in Mumbai yesterday, will be ratified at the BCCI's AGM in September.\n\nThe BCCI is believed to be concerned about the possibility of mass retirements by domestic players - all of whom are without contracts - to pursue opportunities elsewhere.\n\n\"We'll come out with a policy to prevent the trend of pre-determined retirement,\" secretary Jay Shah said after the Apex Council meeting. \"The office bearers will make a policy and send it back for approval.\"\n\nRelated\n\nAmbati Rayudu joins St Kitts & Nevis Patriots as marquee player for CPL 2023\n\nMLC wants more England cricketers, but not to 'start a war with anyone'\n\nBCCI approves India's participation in Asian Games\n\nBCCI allows two bouncers per over at Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy\n\nDu Plessis, Conway, Santner reunite with coach Fleming at Texas\n\nRayudu announced his retirement ahead of Chennai Super Kings' fifth IPL triumph, in Ahmedabad in May. At the time, Rayudu, who had previously retired only to make a comeback, had promised \"no U-turn\".\n\nTwo weeks later, he was named along with a number of other present and former Super Kings players such as Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner, as signings for the Texas franchise, which is also run by N Srinivasan's India Cements that also owns Chennai Super Kings. The Texas team will be coached by Stephen Fleming with Eric Simons and Albie Morkel as assistants coaches.\n\nAs things stand, Indian players can feature in overseas T20 leagues only if they are retired from international cricket and BCCI-run tournaments such as the IPL. Unmukt Chand, the former India Under-19 World Cup winner, is an example of a player who left Indian cricket to pursue opportunities overseas.\n\nChand announced his decision in 2021, aged 28. Since then, he has featured in the Big Bash League for Melbourne Renegades and Bangladesh Premier League for Chattogram Challengers.\n\nMLC 2023 is a six-team event, scheduled from July 13 to 30. Super Kings will play the tournament opener against Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nShashank Kishore is a senior sub-editor at ESPNcricinfo"

Barring Klaasen and opener Nauman Anwar (51), no other Orcas player crossed 10.\n\nEarlier, MI New York closed in on a 200-run total, led by Nicholas Pooran’s 34-ball 68 and Kieron Pollard’s 34 off 18. Before his four-wicket haul, Boult had put in a six-ball cameo worth 20 runs.\n\nThe Orcas are now two points clear of the Texas Super Kings at the top, having lost just one of their five games.

        "date": "Fri Apr 14 17:52:28 2023",
        "body": "In a relief to both Major League Cricket (MLC) and Minor League Cricket (MiLC), both USA Cricket and International Cricket Council (ICC) have sanctioned the two leagues. While the USAC announced its nod in a media statement few hours ago, it is reliably learnt that ICC has given the green signal too.\n\n“USAC is pleased to announce the sanctioning of the Major League Cricket (MLC) and Minor League Cricket (MiLC) tournaments for 2023. Over the past few months, we have worked diligently with Ace to ensure that the MLC and MiLC are positioned well to support the growth of cricket in the United States,” a media release by USA Cricket stated.\n\nAlso Read: Cricket Could be a Catalyst in Strengthening India’s Bilateral Ties With Saudi Arabia\n\nHours after the USA Cricket release, ICC too has sanctioned the two leagues and have allowed the Members to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to players invited to participate in the two leagues.\n\n“ICC has sanctioned the Major League Cricket and Minor League Cricket events. Members are free to issue NOC to any of their invited players to participate in these events should they wish to do so,” a ICC source told News18 CricketNext.\n\nIndustry sources tracking developments revealed that the delay in sanctions was a ploy by the USAC to revise terms of the original agreement it had signed with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) – the group behind the two leagues – back in 2019. The media release hinted at a possibility of reviewing the original agreement.\n\n“We are pleased with Ace‘s commitment and best efforts to include all the current men’s national team players in the major league tournament. Additionally, we look forward to working with Ace to provide governance of the tournaments. Finally, we will review our commercial relationship with Ace over the next few months,” the release added.\n\nAlso Read: ICC Committee May Propose 37% Revenue Share for BCCI From 2024-2027 Cycle\n\nLast month, days after the historic MLC draft, ICC shot an email to its members and urged them to not issue NOCs (No Objection Certificate) to its players for the two leagues. The ICC had no option but to send the note as the process to sanction the league had not reached the global cricketing body.\n\n“The reason the note was sent to Members was that the process to sanction the league has not yet reached the ICC not that there are any perceived issues. For any domestic league involving overseas players from a Full Member the Associate Member must get the event sanctioned,” an ICC source had told News18 CricketNext.\n\nThe MLC will be a six-team competition featuring Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom. The tournament is set to begin in July this year and will see participation from international stars like Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Marsh, Quinton de Kock and others.\n\nThere is plenty of Indian interest, apart from the team ownership, as the likes of Unmukt Chand, Harmeet Singh, Smit Patel and Milind Kumar will turn up for their respective teams.\n\nWhile Unmukt, Smit and Harmeet were part of the India U-19 squad which won the 2012 World Cup, Milind was a consistent performer in the domestic circuit for Delhi before he moved base to Sikkim and Tripura.\n\nUSA Cricket election results announcement\n\nIn another development, USA Cricket announced delayed results for the 2021 elections. Arjun Gona was elected as the Individual Director while Srinivas Salver and Anj Balusu were elected unopposed as Male Director and League Director respectively.\n\nThe voting for the aforementioned posts ended over a week back but there was a delay in announcement of the results of already delayed polls."

        "title": "Major League Cricket, with $120M pledged, pitches a new T20 venture in the U.S.",
        "date": "Thu Jun  9 00:00:00 2022",
        "body": "In the late 18th century, when Great Britain’s 13 North American colonies were desperately battling for their independence, soldiers in the rag-tag Continental Army would play various games while encamped in places such as Valley Forge, Pa.\n\nOne game was a form of cricket, a sport that would maintain relative popularity in the new United States for decades. Yet when another war raged across the new nation, this time a far bloodier civil war, a new sport had evolved that would overtake the decidedly British game of cricket – baseball.\n\nEarly baseball clubs nabbed some of the best American cricket players, and journalists started writing about baseball.\n\nThe rest is history: While cricket’s American popularity faded, it erupted across Britain’s global-spanning empire, particularly in India and the West Indies. That’s helped make it the world’s most popular sport after soccer – except in the U.S. of A., where even baseball was pushed aside for American football.\n\nVarious unsuccessful attempts have been made to re-introduce cricket to American audiences, and while it thrives at a local level in places, particularly those with large South Asian populations, it remains something of a distant, confusing sport to many.\n\nNow, a monied group of mostly prominent South Asian investors have launched Major League Cricket with the intent of creating a professional league – really tournaments that last six weeks or so – in hopes of capitalizing on the ex-pat communities of cricket fans across the U.S. The goal is to begin play in summer 2023.\n\nQuestion is, can this effort find its footing and become a viable lower-tier property in the crowded American sports market?\n\nMajor League Cricket’s backers – the effort is formally American Cricket Enterprises – say they have the money, game format, built-in audience and business plan to make it work.\n\nLast month, the group announced it had secured $44 million in Series A funding with another $76 million available over the next year. The money will be used to build or retrofit cricket stadiums and training academies, and for other start-up and development expenses.\n\nAmerican Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in 2019 landed the commercial development rights with USA Cricket, the game’s formal sanctioning body in the cricket world, to help finance, develop, and grow the nation’s men’s and women’s national teams – a vital relationship because cricket globally is most popular at the national team level rather than professional leagues. The deal means a long-term investment by ACE of $1 billion to develop cricket domestically at the professional, amateur and national team level.\n\nThat said, the development of what’s called Twenty20 (T20) cricket nearly two decades ago may be the thing that helps Major League Cricket find success. T20 is a shortened high-scoring version of the game, which traditionally was played in matches that took a day or several days to complete. It’s now immensely popular in India and other cricket-playing nations, some of which are developing even shorter versions of the game.\n\nT20 matches are about three hours long – something American sports audiences are used to on television or in person. That’s the magic ingredient MLC’s organizers say will make it work domestically.\n\n“All it will take is a casual fan to watch one of these games, in our stadiums or on TV, it’s so action packed,” Major League Cricket co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told The Athletic last week. “It’s a product that will stand on its own for entertainment for fans. It’s very high-scoring. It’s pretty rowdy and wild but still safe and family-oriented. It’s non-stop noise and entertainment and music, plus all the food.”\n\nThe world’s most-watched cricket league is the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is a T20 league launched in 2008 and is expected to soon land new media distribution rights reportedly worth more than $6 billion.\n\nOne prominent cricket observer agrees that T20 format can help make MLC work here.\n\n“The object is to score as rapidly as possible. The scoring can be quite spectacular. Guys are smashing this ball every which way,” said Stefan Szymanski, a University of Michigan sports management professor and co-author of the recent book Crickonomics: The Anatomy of Modern Cricket. “It could attract interest. The problem is how to get people to start, to give it a go.”\n\n(For T20 and general cricket rules/terms, visit here and here).\n\nInitially, the league intends to market itself to the millions of cricket fans, particularly from South Asia, already living in the United States, Srinivasan said.\n\n“We are very fortunate and in a unique position that we have a large and passionate audience for our sport in the U.S.,” he said. “We think we’ll be an immense success if we’re successful with that audience.”\n\nCricket fans living in North America tend to be wealthier and willing to pay to travel to watch top-tier matches, Srinivasan said.\n\n“We have a good understanding where the audience for cricket lives,” he said.\n\nSrinivasan in 2002 co-founded the Willow TV premium cable channel that broadcasts and streams cricket to about 4 million U.S. homes. He sold it in 2016 to India’s The Times Group media conglomerate but maintains close contact with its executives – including Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain, who are principals at The Times Group and investors in Major League Cricket.\n\nWillow and ESPN are likely candidates for MLC’s broadcast and streaming rights for live matches.\n\nAt the top of the global cricket pyramid is the 10-team IPL, which gets hundreds of millions of viewers and match attendees. While MLC isn’t trying to be that league, its popularity amongst U.S.-based viewers signals that there could be an appetite here.\n\n“These people had no domestic product in the U.S. to go watch a game,” Srinivasan said. “These things led us to believe the time is right for a home grown product.”\n\nThat helped Srinivasan and other organizers to successfully pitch the MLC idea to investors, some of whom will become team owners in the single-entity structure league (akin to Major League Soccer, which doesn’t have franchised clubs).\n\n“That’s the expectation as we formalize league structure,” Srinivasan said. “The investors will morph into a well-defined ownership group, take on next stage of growth, more investment of teams.”\n\nThe internal financial modeling predicts the new league will break even or turn a profit within five to seven years – something Srinivasan said the investors understand. Among the business executives and tech entrepreneurs putting money into MLC, perhaps the most high-profile investor name is Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO and executive chairman. Adobe Inc. CEO and Chairman Shantanu Narayen is investing, too.\n\nAlso among the investors is Ross Perot Jr., son of the 1992 presidential candidate and tech billionaire Ross Perot Sr.\n\nThe $120 million will be used to build, retrofit or upgrade cricket grounds and training academies in several announced markets – Dallas, Seattle, San Jose, Orange County, Calif., and Morrisville, N.C. Another possible site is in Houston, and more stadiums or locations are being scouted in the Northeast, where there are already pockets of cricket fans and players.\n\nThe venues will seat 6,000 to 10,000 fans, or more, with temporary seating expansion possible for major events. The game-day experience will be familiar to fans of other sports: Rowdy cheering, music and entertainment, food and drink, etc.\n\nIs the $120 million pledged to launch Major League Cricket enough?\n\n“I think with the funding commitment we have, we’ll be set for the first few years of the league and the infrastructure work we’re envisioning,” Srinivasan said.\n\nAdditional revenue will come from corporate advertising deals, venue naming rights and media broadcast rights contracts, merchandise sales, data, fantasy sports, gambling, and game-day cash from tickets and concessions.\n\nThe organization’s 26-team semi-pro Minor League Cricket, which begins its 10-week season June 25 in 20 cities, launched in 2021 and has sponsorship deals with Toyota and Sunoco.\n\nThe MLC season structure is still under development but likely will include up to 30 matches per team. Organizers are trying to find the calendar sweet spot that allows IPL and players in other top competitions to play in the U.S.\n\nTop pro cricketers earn about $1 million or more for a season, with many players earning a few hundred thousand dollars for various tournaments. Without revealing pay structure details, MLC backers say player compensation will be on par with the cricket competitions a step below the Indian Premier League.\n\nCricket professionals typically play for their national team as their top gig, and they play in several professional leagues/tournaments each year. They’re not bound to a single club, but while the money is pretty good it’s still not on par for most with what the legacy U.S. major leagues pay their players.\n\n“No cricketer gets paid like a professional baseball player,” Szymanski said.\n\nWhich is ironic, given cricket’s early ties to baseball.\n\n“Most of the early baseball players were cricketers,” Szymanski said. “Henry Chadwick, the father of baseball himself, began life as a cricket journalist and remained so.”\n\nThe Cincinnati Red Stockings famously hired cricketer Harry Wright to pitch, field, and manage. The future Cooperstown enshrinee led an unsuccessful baseball/cricket tour of England in the 1870s, but it was evident by then that the money was in the American game.\n\n“Baseball offered a more profitable opportunity,” Szymanski said.\n\nElsewhere in the world, cricket tended to follow expansion of the British empire, and remained popular after that empire receded and nations achieved independence.\n\n“If we’d successfully suppressed the rebellion, Americans would be playing cricket,” said the British-born Szymanski, chuckling.\n\nBut they didn’t suppress cricket. Baseball did. And that’s a test for trying to reintroduce the game beyond ex-pat followers and their family and friends.\n\n“Launching a cricket league in the United States is something that is going to present a challenge for anybody,” Szymanski said. “They’ve identified a niche market of Indian expats who are likely to be interested and that is potentially a very good market. Most Indians in India are obsessed with cricket. It goes beyond anything you see in American sports and even soccer in terms of committed fandom. These star players rise to the level of a god. Whether it catches on here in America is a question mark.”\n\nMLC potentially has an in-road with American audiences via a developing partnership with Jimmy “Jomboy” O’Brien, founder of a popular sports-based social media empire and a relatively recent fan of cricket. His Jomboy Media company has done some content work with MLC, and O’Brien produced cricket educational content.\n\nO’Brien said he lived for a couple of years in Australia as a boy and played sandlot cricket with friends. After many years away from it, his interest was again piqued last fall when his son was born, and daytime TV sports during his paternity leave included cricket.\n\n“I got super into it,” O’Brien said. “It’s a bat-to-ball skill sport. It’s s a lot of thinking and strategy. A lot of that is similar to why I like baseball.”\n\nHe’s aware of MLC’s plans and expects to eventually have formal talks with its backers on potential formal affiliation. Does he think Major League Cricket can make it?\n\n“It’s going to be really tough and I’m glad they’re trying,” O’Brien said. “If they get top players, cricket fans will tune in.”\n\nThat’s the plan, Srinivasan said. MLC already has signed professional players to participate in the inaugural season, but names haven’t been disclosed.\n\nBecause of the T20’s popularity, competition for the world’s best players will be fierce and potentially costly. But if MLC wants legitimacy with the domestic audience, it will have to pay for talent.\n\nThere are about 4 million people from India or of Indian descent, and nearly 500,000 from Pakistan, living in the United States, per Census data. There are also pockets of cricket fans from the sport’s other powerhouse nations – England, the West Indies (the Caribbean island nations collectively play under that name), Sri Lanka, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Afghanistan.\n\nThere are roughly 200,000 cricket players in the U.S. participating in more than 400 local leagues, tournaments, academies, college and school program, per USA Cricket.\n\nAmerican Cricket Enterprises has to get a sizeable chunk of these fans and players to tune in or attend MLC matches.\n\n“A challenge is to convince the local population of the merits of the sport,” said Joel Seymour-Hyde, managing director of the British office of Octagon, the global sports and entertainment marketing, consultant, and talent agency. “Can you create a product that’s good enough locally to fill stadiums to create and atmosphere and buzz?”\n\nExpectations and internal success metrics are key.\n\n“You’ve got to set realistic goals and not assume you can be the fourth biggest sport in the U.S. in five or ten years’ time,” Seymour-Hyde said. “You don’t have to be huge to be a successful commercial operation.”\n\nSzymanski echoed those sentiments.\n\n“At some level, cricket leagues in the U.S. are viable. The question is whether it will be a small niche activity or gain a wider appreciation in American society,” he said. “If you aim to match the NFL in level of interest in the near future then you’re doomed to disappointment and failure pretty quickly. There also is peril in not being ambitious enough. You’ve seen that to some extent in MLS. It’s where old European players go to die – that has hurt MLS.”\n\nThe graveyard of failed sports leagues in America is pretty crowded, and the road to profitability (or just breaking even) can be long. Failure occurs for myriad reasons – some beyond anyone’s control, such as COVID-19 wrecking many sports endeavors in 2020.\n\n“(The pandemic) did probably set back the league from 2022 to 2023. What that gave us is a timeframe to get some of our venues in place by then,” Srinivasan said. “We’ve managed to get out feet wet in terms of organizing events of a national scale, with player contracting and getting our venues ready.”\n\nAnother obstacle for non-fans is cricket’s rules and terminology. And cricket’s reputation is that of a sport that can take literally days to play and employs a terminology foreign to U.S. fans of the other major leagues. What’s a wicket, over, and innings?\n\n“You have to drop some of the words – the toughest thing is the language of the sport,” O’Brien said. “Slang has become the official definition of things.”\n\nCricket education also is part of MLC’s business plan.\n\nOn the upside, the endeavor is happening at a time when TV networks and tech giants are spending princely sums for live sports content to populate their streaming services. Last year, for example, ESPN inked a five-year, $10 million-plus steaming rights contract with Cricket West Indies, a deal that includes 58 T20 matches.\n\nMLC could enjoy a similar deal, and said an announcement is coming soon. ESPN and Willow TV are the obvious leading contender for such rights deals. ESPN parent Disney bought the CricInfo website in 2007 and today the @espncricinfo Twitter account has 6.6 million followers.\n\nTelevision and streaming are key to making MLC work. The U.S. is often second after India when it comes to TV audience for cricket’s internationally televised tournaments, Seymour-Hyde said, and that’s driven by the ex-pat population. And the fact that cadre of fans lives in the United States is even more enticing to organizers, even if many sports – soccer, rugby, lacrosse – also are trying to carve out niches.\n\nSrinivasan said studies show that the potential U.S. cricket audience is more than 10 million and perhaps up to 20 million viewers. That many eyeballs would certainly interest advertisers.\n\nWhile MLC’s deal with USA Cricket includes help for both the men’s and women’s national teams, the pro league will begin as men’s only. The venues and academies will be available for potential women’s teams and leagues, the group said.\n\nAlso potentially giving MLC a leg up is cricket’s T20 World Cup, which the United States and West Indies will co-host in 2024. “All eyes of the world of cricket will be on the US in ’24,” Srinivasan said.\n\nWhile the challenges are evident, the fact that there’s a sizeable ex-pat audience, the coming T20 World Cup, the media industry’s thirst for live sports content, and cricket potentially returning to Olympic competition – it was last played in the 1900 Summer Games in Paris – looks to be an alignment of stars for Major League Cricket.\n\n“A good as moment as they could find to give it a go. I don’t think you can see a better opportunity,” Seymour-Hyde said.\n\n(Top photo: Peter Della Penna / Courtesy of Major League Cricket)"

        "date": "Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) finally got under way in the US last week after several false starts, fuelling hopes the sport is poised to break new ground in a huge new market on the back of the popular Twenty20 format.\n\nFive years after USA Cricket shared its plans to launch a domestic T20 tournament, the inaugural edition of the MLC kicked off having assembled an impressive array of investors.\n\nFour of its six franchises are owned by business entities which also own teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the money-spinning standard bearer of franchise cricket.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is co-owner of the MLC’s Seattle franchise, while Washington and San Francisco franchises have strategic partnerships with the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria.\n\nWhile franchise-based competitions are springing up all around the world, Tom Dunmore, MLC’s marketing vice-president, said the US competition cannot be dismissed as “just another T20 league”.\n\n“We’re building stadiums and youth academies, we’re building training centres and bringing in coaches and players,” he told Reuters from Dallas.\n\n“Those will be available for the US national teams as well. It’s not really like other T20 leagues that are using existing facilities in cricket-mad countries.”\n\nThough cricket remains a niche sport in the US it has been around for a long time in the country — the first international cricket match took place in New York in 1844 with the US taking on Canada.\n\nThe MLC could be cricket’s vehicle to break into a sporting landscape dominated by baseball, basketball and American football, Dunmore said.\n\n“We’re cracking a new market for the sport,” he added. “Cricket hasn’t really broken into a major new market for some time.\n\n“So this is a chance not only to do that, but to do it in the world’s biggest commercial market.”\n\nDunmore said cricket’s existing fan base in the US made it the sport’s fifth-largest market.\n\n“If we slice off even a small percentage of the rest of the population, you’ve got a massive market.”\n\nWest Indies’ Kieron Pollard, one of the first players to fully embrace franchise cricket, was confident MLC would take cricket “prime time” in the US, even though others had failed to break open the market.\n\n“Obviously before MLC, different people have tried different things,” the 36-year-old, who leads the league’s New York franchise, said.\n\n“But now the difference is the backing of the Indian franchises and the international players that are coming.”\n\nSuccess on the global stage would help boost cricket’s profile in the US, and while there has been no big breakthrough as yet Pollard said they are getting closer.\n\nA US team featuring players mostly of Indian origin made it to the 50-overs World Cup qualifiers in June but failed to make the cut for the main tournament in India later this year.\n\nBut the experience of rubbing shoulders with the likes of former SA captain Faf du Plessis and England international Jason Roy would stand them in good stead, Pollard said.\n\n“It augurs well for US cricket, and hopefully the young talent that is there in America can use this opportunity to grow into better international cricketers,” he added.\n\nCo-hosting the T20 World Cup next year with West Indies will also give the game a boost in the US.\n\nThe launch of the MLC assumes even more importance coming at a time when the International Cricket Council (ICC) is lobbying for the game’s Olympic inclusion at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\nDunmore said the MLC was providing cricket much-needed visibility as the game bids to return to the Olympics for the first time since 1900.\n\n“The crowds and the excitement, the buzz, the media attention both in the US and globally, now that’s truly helpful,” he added.\n\nICC CEO Geoff Allardice acknowledged the buzz MLC has created in the US.\n\n“There are a number of developments in the US that are helping to raise awareness of the game.\n\n“The start of the MLC is one of them, they draw a lot of attention to the sport,” Allardice said last week.\n\nReuters"

        "body": "Move over, pickleball. There’s an even bigger sport in town.\n\nThis week, Major League Cricket will play its first-ever game in the U.S. and every last ticket to the highly anticipated opener has been sold. (Don’t worry, it’s also being broadcast live.) The Texas Super Kings will face off against the Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Thursday. The 6,000-person venue replaced the former home of the professional baseball team, the AirHogs. Anurag Jain, the managing partner of venture capitalist firm Perot Jain, is part-owner of the Texas Super Kings and founded the Dallas-based franchise earlier this year in hopes of creating a buzz stateside.\n\n“My vested interest was to bring cricket right into the heart of America,” Jain told Bloomberg. “I see a lot of cricket being played one off, club level, league level, at the local levels. But not at the professional level and that’s what I really wanted to change.”\n\nCricket is currently ranked as the second-biggest sport in the world right behind soccer, and Jain’s not the only one betting on its future. Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside business mogul Jay Mehta, acquired the Knight Riders back in 2020 and has plans to build his own state-of-the-art cricket stadium 40 miles outside L.A. The $30 million venture is being spearheaded by Major League Cricket and designed by award-winning architecture firm HKS.\n\nHistorically, the bat and ball sport has struggled to develop a fan base outside of India, South Africa, Australia, and the U.K. However, deep-pocketed investors are willing to put an impressive $120 million into the U.S. league to expand its profile in America, Bloomberg reported.\n\nOf course, with this kind of financial backing, cricketers from across the globe want in on the action. The Texas Super Kings have since signed overseas players including Devon Conway, Dwayne Bravo, and David Miller. Veteran South African batter Faf du Plessis has also joined the team as captain, while West Indies spinner Sunil Narine leads the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n“American sports fans want to see the best in the world,” MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport. “That’s the demand in U.S. professional sports.”"

It was a fullish ball that hit him in front of off, his feet were bent and he tried to slice it away Eoin-Morgan-to-Ravi-Rampaul style, sans the follow-through. Got hit in front of all three. Hawk-Eye shows it was going on to hit middle and off. 168 / 6\n\n3.6 to Q de Kock , Zampa's lucky to have QDK holed out at mid-off. QDK danced down the ground, read the googly and got to the pitch of the ball. But it was on leg stump and the shot attempted aimed to go over mid-off/extra cover. He toed it straight to Narine, who jumped a bit and took it around chest-height. Zampa did toss the ball up there.. 32 / 1\n\n13.1 to SS Ranjane , Slog sweep is top edged. Flies straight to deep forward square. It was a bit too full and slow for the shot. 104 / 4\n\n4.6 to Nauman Anwar , Taken at short third but the batter's staying in, they're checking for the no-ball. Not front-foot but a second-bouncer thing. Anway leant back and tried to ramp it. Couldn't manufacture enough room, the ball looked a bit around shoulder height but Anwar was leaning back. That means the bouncer isn't too high. Spencer timed his jump well at short third and took a high catch took his right. Anwar's quickfire 32 comes to an end. 45 / 2\n\n8.4 to H Klaasen , Narine outsmarts Klaasen to knock over the stumps. Klaasen made room again but Narine darted a carrom ball on a length. The around-the-wicket angle took the ball away. Klaasen tried to go over cover again, the ball kept low. Klaasen tried to get low and check his shot, missed it and got his off stump rattled. 81 / 3\n\n1.2 to JS Malhotra , Jayasuriya runs back and takes an excellent catch. He was looking up and hobbling a bit, managed to watch it through and lunge forward to maintain balance. The ball was on a back of length over middle, Malhotra was dancing down. Gave a bit of room to himself and tried to flap it over midwicket. Top edge takes it to backward point. 4 / 1\n\n1.6 to G Singh , Gannon's too quick, has Gajanand glove the pull back to the keeper. Not that short a ball. It was around waist-height, coming into the body. Gajanand tried to pull it fine but got cramped. It went right up and QDK took a dolly. Gannon's got two off his first.. 8 / 2\n\n16.2 to A Zampa , Jones comes in from deep cover and takes a good sliding catch. Ball was on a length outside off, Zampa sliced it off the top edge in an attempt to carve it squarer. Man from cover was running back but had to pull out, Jones chugged at full steam to make it. 135 / 8\n\n4.4 to Saif Badar , Top edge off the slashing blade is taken at point. Saif goes, LAKR reeling at 22 for 4. Saif was walking down and got a hard-length ball outside off. Tried to go over the infield, got caught by Anwar. 22 / 4\n\n13.1 to SP Narine , There's one. Tries to take on the midwicket boundary but the slower ball foxes Narine. It was on a length around off, Narine had an almighty smite at it but got it off the toe. Bread-basket catch for the man in the deep. Tye pumps the air in celebration. 105 / 6"

        "date": "",
        "body": "The most ambitious attempt yet to establish professional cricket in the United States gets under way on Wednesday when wickets will be pitched for the start of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket.\n\nWith backing from four franchises in the Indian Premier League, including the league's most successful teams the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings, MLC has plenty of money and expertise behind it, unlike prior attempts to crack the American market.\n\nAs well as financial muscle and television deals, MLC has also been sanctioned by USA Cricket and the International Cricket Council - rubber stamps that have been absent from short-lived private ventures in the past.\n\nLike the IPL, the league will play the shortest and most explosive version of cricket, Twenty20, and has recruited some experienced international players.\n\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\n\nWhile cricket has long been played at a recreational level in the USA - the first-ever international game being between the USA and Canada at New York in 1844 - there remains a shortage of facilities for the sport in a country where baseball is beloved.\n\nA former baseball park in North Texas, Grand Prairie Stadium, has been transformed into a cricket-specific venue and will be the site of the opener when the Texas Super Kings face the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\n\nWhile organizers expect good levels of support from fans with family backgrounds in cricket-loving countries, they aim to gradually win over the broader American public.\n\n\"The goal is to grow the game of cricket and expose the sport in the USA,\" tournament director Justin Geale, told AFP.\n\n\"We've got some of the best players in the world that can actually represent the product, do it justice. So it's going to be a good quality game of cricket that gives us the best chance to show existing fans and new fans the game.\n\n\"We've got as far as anyone ever has. So after all the false starts, I think it's finally here.\"\n\n'An exciting project'\n\nPart of the groundwork that MLC did was been the creation of Minor League Cricket, a 26-team competition which began in 2021 to spark domestic player development.\n\nThe teams will feature a maximum of six foreign players and a minimum of five domestic players and Geale says developing a talent pool for the USA national team is a big part of the mission.\n\n\"Building talent here domestically is one of our big pillars for sustainability,\" he said.\n\nIt will be a challenge for coaches and captains to manage teams with experienced international players alongside emerging domestic players but South African Robin Peterson, head coach of the Mumbai Indians-backed MI New York team, says it will work.\n\n\"In my experience, I found that the local boys tend to learn quite a bit playing alongside these superstars,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I've seen it firsthand in the SA20 and even if you look at the growth and trajectory of the Indian cricket since the inception of the IPL, it has just been amazing the amount of talent that they're producing.\n\n\"I see the league here playing a similar role for USA cricket.\"\n\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\n\nPeterson is optimistic that T20, much more than longer forms of the game, has the ingredients to win eyeballs in the American market.\n\n\"It's becoming more entertainment,\" he said. \"It speaks to the American sporting psyche where the players are a lot more physical, fitter, stronger, hit the ball further."

So much that the International Cricket Council made them the “co-hosts” of the 2024 T20 World Cup along with the West Indies. Suspense and drama continues over that move because, as News18 CricketNext reported last month, the tournament could be shifted to England due to under-preparedness of cricket infrastructure in the US and the ongoing governing issues.\n\nThe larger question remains: is US ready to welcome cricket?\n\nUnlike other regions, US is a market that’s distinct from say India, England or Australia. For the Americans, sport needs to be a spectacle, a source of entertainment and for them getting maximum entertainment/return for the dollar spent is more important than the perfect outswing or a glorious cover drive.\n\nOver the last few weeks, News18 CricketNext spoke to numerous people in the US – from administrators to expats to fans and all acknowledged hosting just a cricket match in the US is not going to do the trick. Even for the expats, every delivery has to be “an event” and a source of entertainment.\n\n“The way professional sport is presented in America, it’s very different. Every time there is a stoppage in play, there is an activation going on. There is something going on in the stadium or in the crowd. So you have to think about how you will present a show. They don’t call going to a show in baseball for no reason at all. When we went to see the Dallas Wings play, when we went to see Angel City Soccer, there is a lot of stuff going on around the actual sport. So you have to build that along with what you are doing,” says Shaun Martyn, founder of FairBreak Global.\n\nMartyn was set to host an edition of the FairBreak Global Invitational tournament in the US in September but decided to postpone it. For him, it was a strategic call to use the time to understand the “educated” American audience and the team at FairBreak “collectively agreed” to prepare for the “spectacle” and give their best shot.\n\n“I don’t know whether I am right in that view and it’s more of a gut feeling I have. Everything we have done so far, we have put in a lot of thought into it. The American sporting audience is highly educated. Not that others around the world aren’t, but American sporting audience is very educated. The way they do sports there is like you are going to a place of entertainment. Collectively our team asked are we putting on a show to engage the US audience? Especially with the expectations they have when they go for other sports. Last year in August I went to watch a college football match in the US and there were 66,000 people in attendance. Putting on a spectacle demands a lot of thought and preparation. That’s what we as a team realised and collectively agreed upon,” adds Martyn.\n\nThe Major League Cricket test\n\nFinally, the inaugural edition of the MLC gets underway on July 13 at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas and everyone will be closely tracking the response of the tournament which has no dearth of star power. Four IPL franchises – Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals, Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians – have acquired teams and top international players will be in action from July 13-July 30.\n\n“The big test will be the MLC. If the MLC doesn’t take off, then nothing will, trust me on this. US is a very difficult market to penetrate. And you don’t get too many shots at that. One miss and you are gone. So MLC can’t afford to mess it up. Not just for them but for the overall future and popularity of the game. Right now, all the infrastructure and governance can take a backseat. MLC has to put on a real show and keep the audience engaged and interested for over two weeks. Out of curiosity and excitement, it will be easy to get the fans to the stadium once, but the key would be to make them come again. Even if it’s the large expat base,” says a veteran cricket administrator in the US.\n\nThe organisers have planned a drone show and fireworks for the opening night of the MLC and more such initiatives will be seen during the course of the tournament. The tickets for the matches start at $30 and American fans certainly want maximum return for every dollar spent.\n\n“The opening night of Major League Cricket will be an unforgettable experience for fans on and off the field. The drone show, fireworks and the pageantry traditional to American sporting events will provide a thrilling stage for the world’s best cricketers competing in the inaugural match of Major League Cricket,” Sameer Mehta, Co-founder, Major League Cricket, said in a statement.\n\nNot just the organisers of MLC, everyone from ICC to various other stakeholders will be tracking the tournament. MLC could well turn out to be the springboard for cricket in the region or the anchor which takes the entire ship down.\n\nEven for Martyn and FairBreak, success of MLC is important because it will “create interest in the US”.\n\n“We want the MLC to be successful because it will help create interest in the US. I personally think women’s cricket will be very successful in America. I think it will do what women’s soccer has done in America. In terms of our mission which is around social impact – what we do and how we change lives around for women. That is our very clear focus.\n\n“For cricket to be very successful in America, the expat community is going to be very important for us. The community will play a major role in moving cricket into American sporting psyche and help making it successful on a long term basis. Purely from a women’s cricket perspective, we wanted to spend some more time educating the people what FairBreak does. Probably the next month, I will be announcing something which is going to be very exciting and will further underpin what I am talking about in terms of establishing our brand there. It wasn’t about using the MLC opportunity but about what we want with our brand in the US market,” says Martyn.\n\nThe expats are excited for the start of MLC as it gives them an opportunity to see their favourite stars from close quarters. They, however, want to keep their expectations in check. India and West Indies have played few T20Is in US in the past, and will again play in a series next month, but MLC serves cricketing action featuring top international stars for more than two weeks.\n\n“We are excited to see these international players. We are also realistic when it comes to expectations. Let’s be honest, it’s not going to be the IPL or anywhere close to it. Idea is to enjoy these matches and hope it gets the desired attention in the region. There won’t be any Indian players in the league, I mean the active ones, so let’s see how things unfold,” says a financial executive from India, settled in US since the last 10 years.\n\nThe next few weeks will decide whether the noise around bringing cricket to the US turns into music or fades away like a broken record. As most have said, cricket won’t get many shots to penetrate the US market."

        "body": "Major League Cricket, the much-anticipated new professional T20 league hoped to finally ignite the sport in the U.S., has been officially sanctioned after a dispute between U.S.A. Cricket and league organizers threatened to jeopardize the launch of the historic competition.\n\nAccording to sources, the International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - has sanctioned MLC and Minor League Cricket. Both tournaments have been supported and approved by U.S.A. Cricket.\n\nThe sanctioning means that ICC members can issue No Objection Certificates to their players who want to compete in the MLC which starts in July.\n\nThe ICC last month deemed MLC and Minor League Cricket as \"disapproved\" and stated that \"members should not issue NOCs to their players to participate in either event\".\n\nBoth events are administered by American Cricket Enterprises, which signed a 50-year commercial rights agreement with U.S.A. Cricket in 2019. There has been warring between them with ACE concerned about tumult hitting U.S.A. Cricket, which includes high-profile leadership duo Paraag Marathe and Iain Higgins having left their roles in contentious circumstances.\n\nThe ICC board was given an update on the issues of USA Cricket during its quarterly meetings in Dubai last month. There is much at stake with the ICC for some time deeming the world's biggest sports market as cricket's number one growth country.\n\nThe U.S. is co-hosting next year's T20 World Cup with the West Indies in a landmark event hoped to continue momentum on the back of the MLC, which now appears set to start on time on July 13.\n\nThe 18-day tournament, consisting of 19 matches and six teams, will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas which has been earmarked as the hub for cricket in the U.S.\n\nMLC will spread to other cities in the future once infrastructure is finalized in a tournament hoped to light a fuse in a country long considered the sleeping giant for a bat and ball sport with a strong British footprint.\n\nInaugural franchises are from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas, Seattle, Washington DC and New York - strategic places with large numbers of South Asian expatriates and deemed growth areas for cricket.\n\nWith several franchises from money-spinner Indian Premier League staking a flag in potentially lucrative new terrain, MLC has secured more than $40 million in funding and over $100 million in “handshakes” with private investors including tech giants Microsoft MSFT .\n\nSalary caps were reportedly around $1 million per team with top players set to receive similar remuneration per game to cashed-up start-up leagues in the UAE and South Africa.\n\nEven though the competition was shrouded in uncertainty, a gaudy player draft was held last month in Houston with the first six marquee overseas signings announced.\n\nThe headliners were high-profile Australians Aaron Finch, Mitchell Marsh and Marcus Stoinis in the type of star power hoped to provide the tournament heft and credibility amongst cricket and American sports fans alike.\n\nWith MLC finally officially sanctioned, though dark shadows continue to linger amid volatile surroundings, there should be more marquee signings imminently as cricket's big moment in its coveted locale inches closer."

        "date": "Thu Jul 20 10:00:07 2023",
        "body": "The first professional franchise cricket league in the United States launched this month. Curious Americans, don’t worry. The games won’t take days. There won’t be hours-long periods of play when nothing seems to happen. And no extended breaks when the teams disappear for “lunch” or “tea.”\n\nInstead, expect an action-packed type of cricket, with batters going for big hits from the outset and fielders throwing themselves around in an attempt to make catches or stop runs.\n\nMajor League Cricket in the U.S. is using the Twenty20 format, also known in the business as T20, one of the game’s shortest, quickest and newest versions.\n\nThink of it as cricket 2.0.\n\nWhile cricket still has its traditional test matches, which last up to five days and have no other restrictions on how long an innings can take, T20 is a limited-overs game and gives each team a set number of balls to get as many runs as it can.\n\nThe upshot is a far more exciting chase to get quick runs before your 20 overs are up. Those 20 overs translate as 120 balls, or deliveries, to hit. Each team gets one inning of 20 overs, hence the name Twenty20.\n\nMajor League Cricket is launching partly because the T20 World Cup featuring the world’s best international teams is set be co-hosted by the U.S. next year.\n\nWHEN DID TWENTY20 CRICKET START?\n\nT20 was first played at franchise level in England in 2003. That makes it a baby in terms of cricket, which has been played in one form or another for at least 400 years.\n\nWithin four years, T20 had its own World Cup and it has spawned franchise leagues in all the major cricketing countries, as well as some not so familiar with the game. There are lucrative T20 leagues in India, Pakistan, England, Australia and South Africa, of course, but also in newer cricketing territories such as the Middle East, Canada and the Netherlands.\n\nMajor League Cricket is the newest T20 league in the world and Americans the latest audience to get a taste.\n\nSPEED AND ENTERTAINMENT\n\nThe two important factors with the T20 format: It hurries the game up, meaning, generally, much more excitement. The game is also shortened time-wise and takes around three hours to complete, making it comparable to a baseball game and therefore easier to consume for young fans or those new to the sport.\n\nYou can watch a T20 game on a Friday night instead of having to give up your entire day for a one-day international or week to keep track of a test match like the Ashes.\n\nWhile the format leads to fast and furious action on the field, T20 has also sparked an evolution in off-field entertainment in cricket. Cheerleaders dancing on podiums, DJs sitting behind decks spinning tunes and fancy dress themes are all part of the T20 game, bringing a colorful new twist for supporters at the stadium and viewers on TV or online.\n\nCompetitions for fans at the game are also common to create a party atmosphere, like offering money for anyone who can make a one-handed catch when the ball sails into the crowd. Unlike baseball, though, the ball must be returned to the field.\n\nRULES\n\nCricket’s normal rules still apply in T20 games, meaning there might still be a steep learning curve for new fans unfamiliar with the leg before wicket law.\n\nAt least there will be no ties. Test cricket has two ways for a game to have no winner, even if it’s been going on for five days.\n\nBut in T20, if the teams get exactly the same number of runs — 150 runs is an average score and more than 200 a really good score — then there is a “Super Over” to decide the game. That means each team faces one over of six balls to smash as many runs as it can and whoever wins that tie-breaker wins the game.\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE CRICKET\n\nMajor League Cricket is up and running, having started last week. The tournament is being played at two venues, a former baseball park in Grand Prairie, Texas, and a cricket ground in Morrisville, North Carolina. There are six teams in the league, which has been in the pipeline since about 2018.\n\nThey are: MI New York, Los Angeles Knight Riders, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and the Washington Freedom.\n\nLike most T20 competitions, Major League Cricket has also attracted international stars. Los Angeles has South African Rilee Rossouw and San Francisco has Australian Aaron Finch. They are both in the top 10 batters in the world in T20 internationals.\n\nRashid Khan of Afghanistan, the top-ranked T20 bowler, is on New York’s roster as is Kagiso Rabada, one of the best fast bowlers in world cricket.\n\n___"

        "body": "Did you know that cricket is the second most popular sport in the world? Second only to football (aka soccer), this sport with roots in 17th-century England has more than a billion fans worldwide and is especially popular in India and Pakistan.\n\nMany Americans aren’t familiar with the sport – but Major League Cricket is on a mission to change that. Although pro teams have played around the world for most of this century, professional major league cricket made its American debut this month with six teams – including plenty of international stars – playing a championship series in stadiums near Dallas, Texas, and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.\n\nOnce America’s national pastime – before baseball took over in the late 1800s – cricket may already be more popular on our shores than people realize, especially in Texas. Tickets sold out for most of the matches in the competition, including the final game on July 30 in Grand Prairie, Texas – and there are multiple amateur cricket pitches (fields) around the country, the largest of which is the Prairie View Cricket Complex, a 90-acre, 10-field facility northwest of Houston that has partnered with the nascent pro league to create the first MLC National Cricket Center.\n\nOn the MLC website, league co-founder Sameer Mehta says, “The passion fans have shown for Major League Cricket in Texas has demonstrated the bright future the game has in the United States … and this is only the start of a fantastic new era for American cricket.”\n\nNaturally, that new era calls for licensed fan merchandise, and the league’s online shop offers jerseys, T-shirts and caps for four of the six teams, with links to two more team shops on separate sites. Optamark Graphics (PPAI 714796, D3), a Connecticut-based distributor, has partnered with MLC to develop a full promo program that includes uniforms and fan apparel for the four teams selling on its site, as well as gameday giveaways for the league.\n\nFor example, fans attending the first match – in triple-digit heat – received a yellow promo flag for the home team, the Texas Super Kings, who won the match and signed the flags for eager fans.\n\nTarang Gosalia, CEO of Optamark and a self-described “passionate fan” of the sport, sees huge growth potential for cricket and says he’s excited to help the league and teams build their brands.\n\n“There seems to be a real fandom behind the sport, and we’re excited that we have this kind of deal in place with Major League Cricket now, not just now but for next season as well,” he says.\n\nIt was important to understand the larger context of the sport in order to develop the initial uniforms and promo offerings, Gosalia adds. The U.S. teams are representative of beloved India Premier League teams, which have huge online fan bases worldwide. The Texas Super Kings are affiliated with the Chennai Super Kings, for example, and their gear needed to reflect that connection.\n\n“They have their own brand standards, their own brand guidelines, their PMS colors from Pantone,” Gosalia says. “We worked with the creative teams at each individual sports franchise. We conceptualized what their current design aesthetic was, and then we created the concept design for the U.S. teams.”\n\nFour essential apparel pieces – jerseys, tees and hats – were selected and produced for the initial fan merch collection using the new team branding elements.\n\nOptamark also created bucket hats given to fans attending the games. Those hats and the flags have proved so popular that they will be added to the merch collections online, Gosalia says. He notes strong demand for apparel in children’s sizes, as well.\n\nOnline traffic and sales for the initial collection have been “tremendous,” Gosalia says, and a great deal stronger than expected. Texas Super Kings gear sold out halfway through the tournament, prompting a quick reorder for the playoffs, and Optamark will use data collected from the online shop, as well as what they’ve learned from in-person sales at the games, to adjust inventory and expand the product offerings.\n\n“We think there’s a lot of opportunity to build on this,” says Gosalia, “because they’re looking to expand with more and more teams within the league as this league continues to grow – and it’s only season No. 1.”"

In the first season of the MLC, six teams– Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, Texas Super Kings, Seattle Orcas, San Fransico Unicorns, and Washington Freedom have taken part. Being the first season, it commenced with a match between Texas Super Kings and LA Knight Riders on the 13th of July while MI New York won the grand final against Seattle Orcas on the 31st of July in Dallas. Let’s contemplate the players with the most runs in Major League Cricket.\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nCharismatic West Indian middle-order batsman, Nicholas Pooran who represented Mi New York gets the top place on the list of most runs in Major League Cricket. Pooran started his new campaign on a high note, making 40 off 28 balls against San Francisco Unicorns. Featuring 8 games, the solid batsman amassed 388 runs at a staggering strike rate of 167.24. The skipper of MINY led his team to victory with his awestruck 40 balls 100 en route to 137 off 55 deliveries in the final to chase down the 184 runs by 7 wickets and 24 balls to spare against Seattle Orcas.\n\nQuinton De Kock\n\nSwashbuckling Proteas batter, Quinton De Kock has been phenomenal and aggregated the 2nd most runs in Major League Cricket with 264 runs in 7 games. His runs have come at a fascinating strike rate of 151.72. In the final match of Seattle Orcas, De Kock went berserk against MI New York and hammered 87 off 52 balls to power his team to 183 in 20 overs, however, Pooran’s rampage innings overshadowed his innings and handed Orcas a 3 wickets defeat.\n\nHenrich Klassen\n\nHenrich Klassen was Seattle Orcas’s other important batsman in the latest edition of the event and occupies 3rd place on the list. Featuring 7 games, the middle-order batsman aggregated 235 runs, averaging a staggering 58.75 and striking at a stupendous rate of 197.47. He also smashed the first-ever century of MLC against MI New York, unbeaten 110 off 44 balls.\n\nDevon Conway\n\nStar Kiwi opener Devon Conway who also opens for the Chennai Super Kings in IPL, finds himself in 4th place on the chart of most runs in Major League Cricket, opening the batting for Los Angeles Super Kings. He played 7 matches and scored 221 runs at a decent average of 31.57 and a nice strike rate of 126.28. The Southpaw hit 2 fifties in the event, including the highest score of 74 against MI New York.\n\nList of Players With Most Runs In Major League Cricket 2023\n\nCheck out Most Wickets in Major League Cricket."

        "date": "Wed Mar 22 21:31:41 2023",
        "body": "Summer is fast approaching, and fans of a popular sport involving balls and bats on a large field are getting ready for the action. But it’s not just baseball season this year. This July, Major League Cricket is set to debut in the U.S., and Texas has one of the first six teams.\n\nCricket is the second-most watched sport in the world, according to a press release from Major League Cricket. The sport has no shortage of fans in places like Europe, South Asia and Australia. So, why hasn’t it ever taken off in the U.S.? Is this the right moment to launch a professional cricket league in the States?\n\nTo discuss further, the Standard was joined by Tom Dunmore, vice president of marketing for Major League Cricket.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nTexas Standard: Tell us about the team that’s going to be based out of Grand Prairie. On Monday, they announced a team name, a coach and some players. What can you tell us?\n\nTom Dunmore: That’s right. They are the Texas Super Kings. That’s in partnership with the Chennai Super Kings, who are one of the top teams in the whole world, an Indian Premier League franchise. They’re bringing all their experience and making sure it’s world-class cricket that we’re playing here in Texas.\n\nThe exciting thing for the fans in Texas is not only do you have a team, but most of the games in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket will be played in Texas, near Dallas. The Grand Prairie Stadium is our first premier cricket-specific venue. So, there’ll be an opportunity to watch all of this happen live in Texas this summer starting on July 13th.\n\nCricket is not an unknown game here in the U.S. It’s been played for decades, but has Major League Cricket ever been tried before in the U.S.?\n\nNo, certainly not at this level. These are the best players in the world coming here: the top coaches, the top players. You know, it’s as if the best players in the world of soccer came to America in the summer to take part in a massive competition. Not only that – we’ll actually have the World Cup of cricket coming the following year in 2024, most likely with games at the stadium in Grand Prairie.\n\nIt’s really an unbelievable launch for the league. We’re taking a bit of a moonshot at this. It’s an ambitious venture, but we’ve got massive backing, and we know there are millions of cricket fans across America, including hundreds of thousands in Texas, which speaks to the diversity of Texas and the number of fans that there are, particularly in Dallas and Houston. We think this is the right time for the league to launch and take advantage of that audience for it.\n\nWhy do you think that cricket has failed to gain momentum in the past?\n\nYou know, it’s a long story. Cricket was once as popular as baseball. In fact, in the 19th century, it was played at a very high level here. In the Civil War, baseball kind of won the battles of the patent ball sports. At the time, it was a little easier to set up and play, particularly when troops were moving around and playing in different types of fields. Cricket takes a little bit more curation of the field. So, you know, baseball won out for 150 years or so.\n\nWe’re not trying to battle baseball. But we do think there’s a lot of fun with this new version of cricket that we’re playing called T20, which is really fast. It only takes about 2 1/2 hours for a match, similar to baseball. There are a lot of what you would call home runs in and big hits in T20 cricket. It’s a much faster, really athletic version of the game that’s taken off in popularity around the world.\n\nWe think it’s a great time to bring that to an American audience, particularly now that there are so many more cricket fans living in America because of the immigration over the last 20-25 years. It’s brought so many fans of the sport here. So, all those stars have aligned to launch this league now.\n\nWhat about the fact that a lot of Americans are a little unclear on the rules?\n\nThe rules take a bit of explaining, but there are definitely ways to do it. You know, I’ve seen some baseball fans do a great job of translating the terminology. My theory actually is the U.S. is a great place to launch a cricket league because Americans love bat and ball sports. A lot of the fundamentals are similar. It’s about hitting, scoring runs, catching outs – much that is very similar.\n\nEven if the wording is different, I think it would actually be harder to do this in Brazil or Argentina, where they love soccer but don’t love a bat and ball sport. So, I think we can translate it. I think we can win fans over. It might take a bit of time, but we’ve got the core fan base here already that loves the sport. We can introduce it gradually to the U.S. fans who aren’t familiar with it.\n\nI think once you see it in person and you see the adrenaline and the excitement and the fireworks and the big hitting, it feels really American as a sport. It’s got a lot of that dynamism to it. I think fans are going to love it once they get out to see a match."

        "body": "MI New York won the first edition of the Major League Cricket. Here is the Overseas Team of the 2023 edition.\n\nA number of overseas stars stood out in the USA-based league, and we have picked the best overseas XI of MLC 2023.\n\nMatthew Wade (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\n168 runs @ 33.60, SR: 163.10\n\nWade’s powerplay strike rate of 188 was the highest among all openers in the season. Though he made only one fifty, he gave his team fiery starts throughout, the highlight being a 41-ball 78 against Los Angeles Knight Riders that propelled San Francisco to 212.\n\nQuinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas) – wicketkeeper\n\n264 runs @ 44, SR: 151.72\n\nApart from Wade, de Kock was the only opener to make 100 runs at a strike rate of 130 at the 2023 MLC, forcing us to go in with two left-handers at the top. While not at his best in the first six overs – he struck at 117 – he made up for it in the middle overs, scoring at 159. De Kock ended as the second-highest run-scorer in the league, topping his season with 87 in the final.\n\nNicholas Pooran (MI New York) – captain\n\n388 runs @ 64.66, SR: 167.24\n\nPooran’s unbeaten 137 in 55 balls in the final helped New York clinch the title, but he was as lethal in the group stage as well. He started with a 28-ball 40 in the opener and also struck two successive sixties and ended as the only player with more than 300 runs in the MLC.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (Seattle Orcas)\n\n235 runs @ 58.75, SR: 197.47\n\nKlaasen had the best strike rate among all players in the league with 30 runs, and made one of two hundreds in the edition. He reached 25 four times, and had a strike rate of more than 190 thrice. His knock of 110 not out against New York was off 44 balls.\n\nAndre Russell (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\n206 runs @ 68.66, SR: 156.06\n\nLAKR finished last, but Russell was the lone performer as he often is with Knight Riders franchises around the world: no one else from the side made more than 135 runs. In the first game, LAKR were all out for 112, Russell top-scoring with a 34-ball 55. He then powered the side in their chase of 213 against San Francisco, and starred in their only win of the season, with an unbeaten 37-ball 70 against Washington Freedom.\n\nCorey Anderson (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\n190 runs @ 47.50, SR: 145.03\n\nThere was stiff competition for this spot, but Anderson edged ahead of Tim David for performing better under pressure. He started with an unbeaten 91 after his team had collapsed to 50-4, hitting seven sixes during his match-winning knock. His 20-ball 39 also proved to be a game-changer as the Knight Riders fell 21 runs short of the target of 213.\n\nShadab Khan (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\n127 runs @ 25.40, SR: 142.69\n\n5 wickets @ 31.20, ER: 9.17\n\nShadab was the only player to pick up five wickets and make 125 runs in the first MLC. He played a number of handy knocks throughout the season, including a 30-ball 61 in his team’s game against MI New York. He top-scored for San Francisco against Seattle with a 23-ball 37 and rose through the batting order to No.4 as the tournament progressed.\n\nImad Wasim (Seattle Orcas)\n\n10 wickets @ 15.30, ER: 6.33\n\nImad was the top wicket-taker among spinners in the tournament, and got a scalp every 14.50 deliveries. He picked up at least one wicket in every match that he played, including ending with two-fors thrice.\n\nRashid Khan (MI New York)\n\n8 wickets @ 20.50, ER: 6.83\n\nAdam Zampa had nine wickets at a better average, but we picked Rashid due to his heroics in the final against Seattle. In a high-scoring game, Rashid stood out for his spell of 3-9 in four overs, ending as the most economical bowler by a huge margin across both teams, establishing his class in high-octane clashes once again.\n\nTrent Boult (MI New York)\n\n22 wickets @ 10.36, ER: 7.39\n\nBoult picked twice the number of wickets as second-placed Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye, and was miles ahead of the rest in the league. He finished with less than two wickets only once in eight games, and scalped three successive four-wicket hauls, and claimed 3-34 in the final, including the wicket of de Kock.\n\nAndrew Tye (Seattle Orcas)\n\n11 wickets @ 20.90, ER: 9.20\n\nThough Tye was expensive on occasions, he got the wickets, and ended with a strike rate of 13.63. He was the standout pacer in the team alongside Gannon and picked at least a wicket in his six games."

        "date": "Fri Jul 14 20:22:13 2023",
        "body": "Major League League 2023 is the latest T20 league which has been launched by USA. The competition has attracted lots of cricket fans following the involvement of numerous international stats. However, the competition will operate without any official status and records achieved during the tournament will not reflect on the players career stats playing in the league.\n\nWhy is MLC 2023 not counted as an official T20 tournament?\n\nThe Major League Cricket has been sanctioned by USA cricket after their dispute with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the league organisers. When the country's official administrative body allowed the league to take place, the International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctioned the league as well. The approval by ICC allowed members to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to their cricketers participating in the tournament.\n\nIf the league was not sanctioned by ICC, the tournament would have been termed as Disapproved Cricket, with members requested not to provide NOCs to their players.\n\nWhichever tournament is not approved following ICC's guidelines, is an unsanctioned league. Players who take part in these kind of tournaments face major consequences. The Indian Cricket League (2007 and 2009), was deemed as a \"rebel league\" with all players facing bans in other events.\n\nThe MLC lacks official legitimacy because it is taking place in the USA, an Associate nation. The MLC is still a valid competition despite its lack of official recognition. Simply said, it indicates that the players' tournament records won't be included in their career statistics.\n\nBoth the 2018 and 2019 Global T20 Canada events and this year's ILT20, which was hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a non-Full-Member nation, also lacked official status.\n\nComing back to MLC 2023, a total of six teams are playing in the tournament. The tournament kickstarts on July 14. The good news for Indian fans is that the league will be available to watch in India. There are going to be 19 matches played in this tournament for 18 days. Four of the six teams in this tournament are backed by IPL franchises."

However, Nortje had the last laugh as he dismissed de Kock immediately, bowling him with a peach of a delivery.\n\nBowled around the off stump, the ball nipped back in. De Kock looked to play the cut but only managed an inside edge, which went on to shatter his stumps.\n\nDe Kock’s departed for an 11-ball 10 in a run chase of 145. His team chased the total in 19.4 overs, with Nauman Anwar and Imad Wasim making 48 and 43 respectively.\n\nWatch the sequence of events between de Kock and Nortje here:"
