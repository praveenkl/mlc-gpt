        "body": "Cricket may not be as popular a sport in the U.S. as elsewhere in the world, but some high-profile CEOs and investors are trying to change that.\n\nAs the Men's T20 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S. for the first time, ramps up, investors have pumped nearly a billion dollars into their American ambition.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen are among the executives investing in the new U.S. professional league, Major League Cricket. Other cricket investors include Iconic Ventures, Madrona Venture Group and executives from Google .\n\n\"What gets me excited is seeing if cricket can become a mainstream sport in the U.S.,\" said Soma Somasegar, venture capitalist and managing director at Madrona.\n\nSomasegar and Nadella are among the key owners of Seattle's cricket team, named the Orcas. They're also investors in the overall league.\n\n\"Satya [Nadella] and I have been talking about bringing cricket to America for many years,\" Somasegar told CNBC.\n\nNadella is such a die-hard cricket fan that Microsoft has a cricket field at its campus in Bellevue, Washington.\n\n\"A lot of us immigrants grew up with this sport. We'd study and watch cricket — on repeat,\" said Somasegar.\n\nIn total, nearly $850 million is currently in the process of being invested in building a viable cricket league in the U.S., people familiar with the funding said. The people asked not to be named because the funding information is private.\n\nCurrently, there are six professional teams in Major League Cricket, with each team expected to spend between roughly $75 million and $100 million over the coming years. That includes the cost of putting together a team, hiring the right talent and building stadiums where live cricket matches can be played.\n\nAdding to the fanfare is the T20 World Cup, which is being held at three locations in the U.S. and several in the West Indies throughout June.\n\nOn Thursday, in a stunning blow, the U.S. team beat Pakistan in a match held near Dallas. Fans are now counting down to the highly anticipated India vs. Pakistan match Sunday at the newly developed Nassau County stadium in New York.\n\nThe last time India and Pakistan matched up, more than 300 million people in India tuned in to watch the game, according to The New York Times.\n\nTicket reseller StubHub said the average price of tickets for Sunday's rivalry match is $1,300. The average price for the other 54 matches of the tournament is $120, the company said.\n\nVenture capitalist Anurag Jain, part owner of Major League Cricket team the San Francisco Unicorns, said the U.S. national team is primarily made up of players in the league.\n\n\"The goal is to make cricket a mainstream sport,\" said Satyan Gajwani, the vice chairman of Times Internet, the digital arm of the Times of India. He heads up Willow TV, which has the exclusive streaming rights for cricket in North America, including the T20 World Cup.\n\nGajwani is also one of the investors in the U.S. league. He said his group is going after the incredibly loyal fans from South Asia who live in the U.S.\n\n\"You essentially have five million really hard-core fans that love cricket,\" Gajwani told CNBC, referring to the South Asian diaspora in the U.S.\n\nHe added that expats from the U.K. and Australia who live in the U.S. are also big consumers of cricket.\n\nSouth Asians on average have the highest gross income of any ethnic group in the U.S., according to research from Indiaspora, a nonprofit community of Indian leaders around the world.\n\n\"That leaves a lot of discretionary income that is available to be spent on sports and entertainment,\" said M.R. Rangaswami, founder and chairman of Indiaspora.\n\nRangaswami, who said he will be at the match Sunday, acknowledged that the U.S. sports scene is tough to crack, with Americans consumed by basketball and football. He said a potential entry point could be through fans of baseball, which has some resemblance to cricket.\n\n— CNBC's Jessica Golden contributed to this report."

        "date": "Thu Jun  6 09:26:00 2024",
        "body": "Seattle Orcas welcome former New Zealand pacer and one of the fastest bowlers to have played the game, Shane Bond as the club’s new bowling coach for Major League Cricket Season Two!\n\nWith former bowling coach Johan Botha taking up the Head Coach role at Queensland Cricket, he was no longer available during MLC Season 2. Pace ace Shane Bond was happy to be part of Seattle Orcas, and with his pedigree, there could be no better fit than the former Kiwi speedster.\n\nWith an experience of 120 international games including 18 Tests, 82 ODIs and 20 T20Is, Bond featured at the top level from 2001 to 2010. He was feared by a lot of batters around the world due to his threatening pace which helped him take 259 wickets in the internationals in which he featured.\n\nShane Bond started his coaching career as a bowling coach with the New Zealand cricket team in October 2012 and continued until the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup where the Kiwis finished runners-up. He was widely credited with shaping Trent Boult and Tim Southee to become the legendary bowlers they are. He has also been the bowling coach of the Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals franchises in the Indian Premier League. Bond also was the assistant coach for the Brisbane Heat in Big Bash League 2015, working with fellow Kiwi Daniel Vettori. In March 2018, he was appointed as head coach for Sydney Thunder.\n\nOn his new role with the Seattle Orcas, Bond said, “I’m excited to be a part of Major League Cricket and the Seattle Orcas. I’m looking forward to working with all the staff and players, especially the domestic players. The United States is a fantastic destination and to be able to be a part of a tournament that’s only going to get bigger and better is fantastic.”\n\n“Shane's a fantastic addition to the Seattle Orcas coaching team\", said Sanjay Parthasarathy, operating partner and co-owner of the Seattle Orcas. \"Shane's experience as a fast bowler, plus his recent coaching experience in the IPL will be an asset to our players and the coaching staff. I want to thank Johan Botha for setting a really high bar last year, and wish him the best as the head coach for Queensland and the Brisbane Heat,\" said Sanjay Parthasarathy, Owner of the Seattle Orcas.\n\nOur young and hungry bowling side is looking forward to being guided by our cool yet experienced bowling coach and it will be safe to say our group is in extremely good hands during MLC 2024!\n\nThank You, Johan Botha, for everything you have done for Seattle Orcas and its fans. Wishing you well in your new role. Welcome Shane Bond to Seattle Orcas."
