        "body": "Cricket is “having a moment\" in the U.S., and investors are \"looking to cash in on a growing audience\" for the world’s second most popular sport, especially among the “cricket-loving South Asian diaspora,” according to Patrick Sisson of the N.Y. TIMES. Backers of Major League Cricket franchises are \"hatching plans for dedicated cricket stadiums in their own cities.” The S.F. Unicorns, L.A. Knight Riders and Seattle Orcas are “negotiating leases and approvals to build new venues, with hopes of opening in the next few years.” During the two-week MLC season and postseason, some 50,000 people attended a dozen matches in Grand Prairie, Texas. The league’s next season starts in July, with Grand Prairie hosting 16 matches, and city manager Bill Hills “expects 85,000 fans will show up for the games.” Sisson noted MLC’s priorities include \"building more 7,000- to 10,000-seat stadiums near vibrant areas that could later blossom into entertainment districts.” The Orcas plan to build a stadium at Marymoor Park in Redmond, Wash., the Knight Riders have scouted a spot at the Great Park in Irvine, Calif. and the Unicorns have proposed building a stadium in the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds (N.Y. TIMES, 6/16)."

        "body": "The Indian Premier League franchises could soon make their presence felt in England too as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) president Mark Nicholas has revealed that as many as five IPL franchises have expressed interest in acquiring a stake in London Spirit. The London-based outfit is one of the eight teams competing in The Hundred.\n\nThe IPL franchises are associated with a number of T20 leagues across the globe. They have teams in the Caribbean Premier League, Major League Cricket, ILT20 as well as SA20. And they could soon have their own teams in England as well.\n\nMark Nicholas revealed the IPL franchises' plans while announcing the plans for the World Cricket Connects symposium at Lord's. The ace commentator is set to take over as London Spirit's chairman in October this year. Recently, MCC CEO Guy Lavender wrote a letter to the club members to seek their approval for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)'s offer to privatize a 49 percent stake in the Spirit.\n\nWhile Nicholas did not reveal the names of the IPL franchises, he made it clear that they are interested in associating with The Hundred. The stakeholders will be finalized through a bidding process while the remaining 51 percent will remain with the franchise.\n\n\"What we are putting to a vote is to accept the ECB’s offer of a 51% share of this franchise,\" Nicholas told ESPNCricinfo.\n\n\"We will always be a members’ club. The first target is membership harmony [because] as a member you are entitled to a view. It’s very easy to knock people back because they’re difficult, but actually there is quite a lot of good thinking that comes out of activism. You have to treat people with respect, and hear their view,\" he added.\n\nThe Hundred has given us another opportunity: Mark Nicholas\n\nThe ECB is planning to privatize the Hundred. The board is planning to privatize the competition by creating eight new companies and gifting 51% of the shares in them to the relevant host county. The remaining 49 percent will be sold to private investors through a bidding process.\n\nNicholas highlighted how the ECB missed out on T20 cricket and India capitalized on it by launching the highly successful IPL. He further stated that The Hundred has given the ECB another opportunity to make amends.\n\n\"We missed out on T20 in 2003 where we could have grabbed it,” said Nicholas. \"India thought quicker than us (on the IPL) and were smarter than us, as India often is. India moves at an extraordinary pace to make things work.\n\n\"So the Hundred has given us another opportunity. The [MCC] membership quite likes being part of the chat, not being consigned to a piece of history. The members I talk to really love the idea of having a team, love the opportunity that it brings. There will be financial opportunity, either in growth of the equity or in sale of the equity,\" he added."

        "body": "Cricket Australia (CA) is reportedly hesitant to grant Travis Head a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for participation in the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States. The second edition of MLC is set to commence right after the 2024 T20 World Cup concludes.\n\nFollowing a successful inaugural season, the 2024 MLC will feature a significant influx of Australian players. Notable names such as Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, and Pat Cummins are expected to join the American league, which will gain considerable attention after co-hosting the World Cup.\n\nTravis Head was also slated to be part of the Australian contingent for MLC, having been signed by the Washington Freedom, a team coached by Ricky Ponting and featuring fellow Australian Steve Smith.\n\nBut with a hectic schedule ahead, including five tough matches against India this year, Cricket Australia is not confident of Head’s participation in the MLC.\n\nMoreover, Head’s recent form in red-ball cricket has been disappointing, with untouchable performances in the home series against Pakistan and the West Indies, and the tour of New Zealand in 2024. He averaged just 24.78 in eight Test innings in which he split, despite hitting a hundred and the experience of a couple of ducks.\n\n“We typically support players pursuing opportunities outside the Australian season where the international schedule, playing loads and fitness allows. However, each NOC request is assessed on an individual basis as will be the case coming out of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.” a CA spokesperson told The Age.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Head also participated in the entire 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season with the SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH).\n\nAustralia has a packed schedule ahead to keep the versatile Head engaged\n\nAustralia’s first international engagement after the 2024 T20 World Cup is a white-ball tour of Scotland and England. They will start their home season with a white-ball series against Pakistan, followed by the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India.\n\nThe 2024 MLC is scheduled from July 6 to July 29, with defending champions MI New York facing the Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last year’s final."
