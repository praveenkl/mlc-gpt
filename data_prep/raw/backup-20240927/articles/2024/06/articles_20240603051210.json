        "body": "Z is for Zampa. Z is also for zany. Australian cricket star Adam Zampa has attracted instant headlines for America’s fledgling Major League Cricket competition - and it had nothing to do with what he did with bat or ball.\n\nThe extroverted Aussie leg spinner instead caused a storm with his choice of number on the back of his LA Knight Riders’ playing shirt. Zampa opted for number 420 - presumably as a reference to marijuana - for the match against the Texas Super Kings.\n\n'SURPRISED': Alex Carey's telling response to Jonny Bairstow Ashes outrage\n\nCLASSIC: Mitchell Starc's hilarious Alyssa Healy reveal amid Ashes battle\n\nHUGE: Michael Neser puts Ashes selectors on notice in astonishing feat\n\nThe origins of 420 are a little murky, with one suggestion it was the police radio call used for any dope related offence in the US. Another explanation is it’s the room number the Grateful Dead insisted on staying in during their touring days.\n\nA more plausible reason is it’s the codename a bunch of schoolboys gave their group in 1971 after discovering a marijuana crop in San Francisco. The boys would meet after school at 4:20pm, hence the tag.\n\nEvery year around the world, marijuana enthusiasts meet on April 20 (4/20 on the American calendar) to celebrate their love of weed and push for its decriminalisation. Zampa has not publicly declared why he chose shirt number 420 but fans have decided it’s his way of bringing a bit of life and colour to the American tournament.\n\nAdam Zampa shirt number takes internet by storm\n\nIt certainly became a major talking point. Fans from around the cricket world took to social media to speculate about Zampa’s motives for using 420.\n\nAdam Zampa remains one of cricket's quirkiest characters\n\nThe 31-year-old has long done things his way, refusing to conform to cricket’s straight-laced ways. He lives on a farm on the NSW far north coast - away from the major cricketing centres - and long ago adopted a vegan diet.\n\nHe is passionate about environmental and social issues and a keen advocate for animal welfare. Now it appears he is lending his support to another popular cause.\n\nZampa’s LA Knight Riders are co-owned by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and boast premier West Indian players Sunil Narime, Andre Russell, South African Rilee Rossouw and New Zealander Lockie Ferguson among their playing ranks."

        "date": "Mon Jun  3 08:36:00 2024",
        "body": "Cricket seems to be winning big time in the USA, as Australia’s ODI and Test captain Pat Cummins has signed for San Franciso Unicorns for the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC). With the franchise sharing a strategic relationship with Victoria’s first-class set-up, Cummins’ signing is a bumper one, with the 31-year-old likely to lead the side following Aaron Finch’s retirement.\n\nUp and running since the New Zealand Tour earlier in February, Cummins would ply his trade in USA’s franchise-based T20 League, starting almost five days after the end of the ongoing 2024 T20 World Cup in the Americas.\n\nAlmost new to franchise cricket, Cummins enjoyed his stint with SunRisers Hyderabad in IPL 2024, where he led the team to the finals in his maiden attempt as a T20 skipper.\n\nALSO READ: ‘It’s not me...’: Gautam Gambhir on replacing Rahul Dravid as Indian team head coach\n\nCummins' signing reflects MLC’s growing eminence in world cricket just after one season and how far it's willing to go. Cummins will join some of the Aussie A-Listers like Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith and Jake Fraser McGurk, with T20I captain Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis and others like to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, the second season of MLC will begin on July 5, with defending champions MI New York taking on Seattle Orcas in the repeat of last year’s final and Texas Super Kings facing LA Knight Riders in a home game later in the doubleheader.\n\nCummins’ rise\n\nAustralia’s bowling mainstay since the start of the last decade, Pat Cummins, took over the captaincy in the longer formats in 2022, guiding Australia to massive heights since.\n\nIn 2023, Cummins-led Australia beat India in the second World Test Championship (WTC) Final at the Oval before they drew the away Ashes 2-2.\n\nA few months later in the 50-over World Cup in India, Cummins guided Australia to their record sixth title, beating the hosts by six wickets in the final in Ahmedabad. The seamer had a cheerful home season before joining SRH as their new captain.\n\nLeading for the first time in T20 cricket, Cummins didn’t put a foot wrong and led his team to their first final in over five years. Although they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders in the title match, Cummins earned praise from all across for his daring and smart captaincy.\n\nThe lanky fast bowler will play in the 2024 T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the USA. Australia is placed in Group B alongside old foes England, Scotland, Namibia and Oman."

        "body": "As administrator Justin Geale assessed the arrival of a jewel of world cricket to the USA, he declared “the train has left” Grand Central Station when it comes to establishing the sport in the United States.\n\nThe Canberra-born Geale is the tournament director for Major League Cricket, which was granted List A status by the International Cricket Council in May, and is among the Australians featuring heavily in the expansion of the sport across America.\n\nAn historic summer in the US, which will host a World Cup for the first time in conjunction with the West Indies, is a significant step forward in what shapes as an important decade for cricket in America — a nation that already boasts a rich and eventful cricketing history.\n\nWatch selected NRL & AFL games, along with every F1 race live in 4K on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial today\n\nSTAR IS BORN: New York-born hero powers USA to historic opening win\n\n‘MUST BE BETTER’: Fallen giants in massive World Cup scare as minnows announce arrival\n\nThe USA will host 16 of the 55 matches in the T20 World Cup ahead of the second edition of MLC — featuring Australians Steve Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell — which runs throughout July and involves six franchises across the country.\n\nAs important as hosting a World Cup is, the biggest step forward for cricket in the US is its inclusion in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, according to Geale.\n\n“The LA28 Olympics is going to be huge for cricket. For the first time, what that does is open up different funding avenues in terms of America, so there are great opportunities there,” he told foxsports.com.au.\n\n“It’s no surprise we’ve got a franchise base (in Los Angeles). That’s a key market for us to get going, because they’re going to play cricket at the Olympics.\n\n“I think it’s all going to happen together over here. The MLC is really important. The minor leagues are important. The US national team is getting stronger and being competitive, which is really important.\n\n“The bigger play here, though, is to make cricket a more mainstream sport is to get into colleges and high schools. It’s a phenomenal setup here in terms of high school and college sports.\n\n“(But) that’s a much longer term play and that’s going to take all main stakeholders from the ICC, USA Cricket and the MLC pulling together.\n\n“But I think that momentum, if you look at the successful MLC launch last year (and hopefully) a strong follow up season on the back of a World Cup, and the US getting stronger into LA28, I think it shows that cricket can work here.”\n\nCRICKET? IN AMERICA? WHY HISTORY SUGGESTS THE WHITE BALL GAME CAN FLOURISH IN THE USA\n\n“A tiger? In Africa?”\n\nThe Monty Python quote sprang to mind when the location of this year’s T20 World Cup was confirmed by the ICC in November, 2021.\n\n“A Cricket World Cup? In America?”\n\nThe tournament serves as a litmus test — America has been earmarked as one of cricket’s growing markets due to its financial power and thriving South Asian immigrant community.\n\nIt is hoped the World Cup will broaden awareness and have a similar impact to what was achieved with soccer in America following the FIFA World Cup in 1994.\n\nThe ICC estimates there are around 30 million cricket fans in the US and the organisation is embarking on a mission to rebuild the sport to mainstream status in a country it considers a sleeping giant.\n\nCricket Victoria’s chief executive Nick Cummins noted the prospective fanbase in the US after his state affiliated with the San Francisco Unicorns ahead of the MLC launch last year.\n\n“It’s not something you would expect to say about America, but there is a significant cricket-supporting population in the country,” he said last year.\n\n“If we just focus on the Bay Area with the Unicorns, there are about 500,000 South Asians interested in cricket just in the Bay Area – so that’s Tasmania. So you’ve got a potential cricket fan base of Tasmania in just one city.”\n\nIt is a point made by Geale, whose organisation is looking to expand the number of cricket venues across the US for a competition currently hosted at grounds in Texas and North Carolina.\n\n“We don’t shy away from the fact that we have an existing fan base here which is really massive by world standards,” he said.\n\n“That is first or second generation (and) there is a strong Indian, Pakistan, Afghani and Sri Lankan population. We break down to an Australian, English, West Indian population on the East Coast.\n\n“The expat market is huge. It’s a very well educated market over here, particularly in the Asian markets, because they have come here to go to college, or their parents have come here, and they are second or third generation now. So we have that fan base already.\n\n“We need to tap into that properly and not shy away from that. So if you come to a ground, you will get a samosa, but you’re also going to get a hot dog as well. The bigger play is to make it more mainstream.\n\n“Do we need to be Major League Baseball? No, absolutely not. But they’re constantly looking at what we’re doing and trying to make sure we’re not stepping on their toes, though I think it’s a big enough market for all of us, to be honest.”\n\nREBUILD CRICKET TO MAINSTREAM STATUS? THE SPORT PREDATES THE ASHES IN THE US.\n\nCricket was one of America’s first outdoor team sports, with archived references to it being played in the United States from 1709.\n\nGeorge Washington’s troops are said to have played a version of the game at Valley Forge during the American Revolution in 1778, while Benjamin Franklin owned a copy of the 1744 Laws of Cricket.\n\nAs cricket spread across the globe via the British Empire, embedding itself into the national identity of Australia and India, the sport also became a popular pastime in the US, with nearly 1000 cricket clubs across 22 states during the 19th century.\n\nThe first international cricket match was played between the USA and Canada in Manhattan in 1844, more than three decades before Australia’s first Test match against England, and is reported to have drawn 10,000 fans.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln reportedly attended a match between Chicago and Milwaukee in 1849, while the Philadelphia Cricket Club had first-class status between 1874 and 1913 and rivalled some of the world’s best teams during the late 19th century.\n\nBut perhaps it is best that some history is left unknown, for the club defeated Australia three times through this period.\n\nCricket’s golden age in America came to an abrupt end when the Civil War started in 1861, with baseball becoming entrenched in the national identity.\n\nAmerican cricket went into a seemingly irreversible decline over the coming decades, fading into obscurity following the world wars.\n\nThe sport’s popularity grew marginally after the United States was admitted to the ICC as an associate member in 1965, but cricket remained relatively unknown until the turn of the millennium, with about 30,000 people playing or watching cricket in America.\n\nCourtesy of the mass influx of immigrants from cricket-obsessed South Asian nations such as India and Pakistan, that figure has since ballooned to more than 200,000.\n\nAmerica’s South Asian population has increased exponentially from 3.4 million in 2010 to 5.4 million in 2023, while the Indian diaspora in the United States is among the wealthiest of any migrant community.\n\nMeanwhile, North America is already the third-largest television market for cricket behind India and the United Kingdom.\n\nA WHITE BALL FUTURE FOR THE STARS AND STRIPES\n\nThe 2024 T20 World Cup is cricket’s latest attempt to push into the largely-untapped American market but it is not the sport’s first attempt to win over the US.\n\nA prototype of T20 cricket called One Season was played in America in 2004 before West Indies legends greats Clive Lloyd and Desmond Haynes launched an early edition of Major League Cricket the following year. Both competitions folded and faded into insignificance.\n\nA decade later, cricket icons Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar hosted a series of exhibition matches across the United States, recruiting former teammates for games in diamond-shaped baseball stadiums. It drew the attention of expats from South Asia and the Caribbean, but failed to capture the attention of the wider American public.\n\nThe US didn’t have the multipurpose facilities required to host an international-quality cricket tournament, partly due to well-documented governance issues between USA Cricket and the ICC.\n\nHowever, the sport’s recent privatisation paved the way for the development of purpose-built cricket stadiums across the country.\n\nIn 2019, American Cricket Enterprises received exclusive sanctioning rights to set up a T20 league in the United States, pledging to invest in local cricket pathway tournaments and help fund cricket stadiums nationwide.\n\nThe deal meant more than $US 1 billion would be invested into the development of domestic US cricket and a couple of years later, the organisation announced the inaugural season of its new T20 tournament — Major League Cricket, the most ambitious attempt yet to establish professional cricket in the US and a competition being steered in part by Geale.\n\nBankrolled by four Indian Premier League franchises and leading Indian-American tech executives, including the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan, MLC quickly became one of the wealthiest T20 tournaments in the world, receiving investments that exceeded AU$174 million.\n\nCricket NSW and Cricket Victoria also joined the venture, signing on as operational partners for two of the competition’s six franchises.\n\nMLC’s inaugural season was played across three weeks at Texas’ Grand Prairie Stadium and North Carolina’s Church Street Park in 2023.\n\nEach of the six franchises — based in Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Seattle and New York City — were given a $1.5 million salary cap to secure 18 players, including seven overseas stars.\n\nThe roster included former Australian captain Aaron Finch, World Cup champion Adam Zampa, T20 globetrotter Tim David, West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell, New Zealand quick Trent Boult and South African prodigy Dewald Brevis.\n\nThe 2023 season surpassed financial expectations, with most of the 19 matches selling out.\n\nMLC has already secured the services of Smith, Head and Maxwell for an expanded 2024 campaign, along with Ricky Ponting as a head coach, while plans are in motion to build more stadiums and infrastructure over the coming years.\n\n“When I came to Seattle in 1989, there weren’t any cricket teams,” Soma Somasegar, co-owner of the Seattle Orcas, told The Athletic.\n\n“Today, there are about 250 to 300 cricket teams in Seattle spread across multiple leagues. That grassroots energy and excitement is true, not just in Seattle but in a lot of cities in the country.\n\n“We’re trying to think for the long term. Attracting the stars is part of how we start; using what they do to penetrate school and college environments to help people see cricket is interesting. Our dream is that kids can see that and then grow up here to play at college or professionally.”\n\nHead, for his part, is excited to be heading to the US to represent the Washington Freedom.\n\n“I just wanted an opportunity to see what that circuit looked like. It is going to be nice to be in the States after the World Cup,” he told foxsports.com.au.\n\n“It is important to have a little bit of a spell before we go to England for those one-dayers and I have to try to prioritise a little bit of rest at some point.\n\n“But to get my first look at T20 franchise cricket, I’m early in the scheme of things in terms of the IPL and there is still a lot of touring to go, but I am enjoying it. It is good. It is fun.\n\n“I feel like I am at the right stage of my career to be able to prioritise all three formats, which is nice. It is a nice feeling from my end.”\n\nHIGH HOPES FOR THE MLC POST THE WORLD CUP\n\nThe 2024 MLC season kicks off four days after the T20 World Cup final and is aiming to capitalise off the buzz generated from the marquee tournament.\n\nThe T20 World Cup will have legitimate cricket fields with drop-in pitches and temporary grandstands, including a $30 million venue in New York that will host the blockbuster match between India and Pakistan.\n\nCurrently, ticket prices for the event range from $2,000 to $22,000, but those prices are expected to leap further closer to the game.\n\nThe 34,000-seat modular Nassau County Stadium, located in a repurposed public park about 50 kilometres east of Manhattan, has finished construction just in time for the event.\n\nA drop-in pitch was grown in the temperate subtropics of Florida and transported in sections across a 2000-kilometre journey along America’s east coast.\n\nGeale believes the wicket for the MLC-operated venue in Dallas, which hosted the opening match of the tournament between the USA and Canada, is world class.\n\n“It has taken four years to get this stadium up in Dallas and the head curator, who is from Adelaide, has done an amazing job,” he said.\n\n“It really is a world class wicket and we can’t wait for the world to see that with the World Cup and with the best players,(which) means that we can showcase the game the best it can be.”\n\nThe T20 World Cup will be competing for airtime alongside the NBA Finals and Major League Baseball, but there otherwise aren’t any major sporting events happening in the United States in June.\n\nThe window in July used for the MLC is also favourable in terms of the international calendar, with the only competition The Hundred in England during July.\n\nCricket has thrown everything it has got at the United States.\n\nThe next decade will provide a gauge as to whether the sleeping giant has awoken and has the muscles to become a power."

Cummins will be the next big signee in the league following fellow Aussies Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith and Jake Fraser Mcgurk.\n\nAs per a report in Cricbuzz, Cummins is set to feature for San Francisco Unicorns in the upcoming MLC and will likely be Aaron Finch's successor after the latter's retirement. He will join fellow Aussies Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk, both of who have signed for the team.\n\nThis tournament will extend Cummins' gruelling cricket schedule, which began in February with Australia's tour of New Zealand. He recently led Sunrisers Hyderabad into the final of IPL 2024 in his maiden stint as T20 captain. Cummins's SRH fell short on the final hurdle, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders in a lop-sided showdown clash last week.\n\nDespite the loss, Cummins' credentials as captain speaks volumes due to his achievements on the International circuit. He has led Australia to the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup victories in 2023. He also led the Aussie team to retain the Ashes in England with a 2-2 draw in a five-match series last year.\n\nThe upcoming MLC will begin on July 5, five days after the T20 World Cup in the Americas. The league recently got the List-A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC), becoming the second Associate-run franchise competition to get this status. The first one to get the List-A status was UAE's ILT20.\n\nThe second edition of the tournament will commence from 5 with defending champions MI New York taking on runners-up Seattle Orcas at the Church Street Park in Morrisville. The opening is a double-header with Texas Super Kings facing LA Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas."

With their captain from the last edition, Aaron Finch retired from all forms of cricket, Pat Cummins is expected to fill the leadership duties at the Unicorns.\n\nThe 31-year-old will go into the league, after successfully leading the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the recently concluded Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024, where they finished as the runners-up after losing the final to the Kolkata Knight Riders at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.\n\nPat Cummins joins Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade in SFU\n\nWith the MLC stint, Pat Cummins will take a huge step towards the T20 franchises league cricket.

The three-week stay in America at the end of the world event will end a long five-month mission for the pacer, which started with the tour of New Zealand.\n\nThe decision of Pat Cummins singing the offer in the MLC has shown his interest towards the franchise system, while it also has been proved that the tournament has begun to grow around the world cricket, among all the other leagues going around.\n\nThe Australia captain joins the likes of Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith and young Jake Fraser-McGurk for the second edition of the Major League Cricket.\n\nThe San Francisco finished the last season at the penultimate position in the six-team tournament, where they could earn only two victories out of the five games, at a net run rate of -0.303. The other Aussie players such as Mitchell March, Stoinis too is expected to make an appearance in the competition.\n\nCummins was fantastic in the IPL 2024, with the bat, and the leadership duties, and even when required to guide themselves with the bat. The New South Wales (NSW) bowler ended the tournament with 18 wickets in 16 innings at an average of 31.44 and an economy of 9.27, with the best figures of 3/43.\n\nAlso Read: AUS vs WI: I Don’t Think He’s Paying Enough Attention To His Side’s Underachievement – Ian Healy Slams Pat Cummins For Being Too Nice\n\nEven in the ground, the southpaw made a great relation with the other members of the team, as he guided the young players beautifully, sharing his huge basket of experience with them, with helping to perform in crunch situations.\n\nIt was quite a phenomenal job by Pat Cummins, who helped the franchise to finish the season at the second position, after being satisfied with the wooden spoon in the last season during the IPL 2023. He will work with the likes of Pakistan pacer Harris Rauf in the San Francisco side.\n\nThe second edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC) will start from July 06, between the MI New York team (MINY) and the Seattle Orcas team (SEA) in Morrisville.

        "body": "New Delhi [India], May 31 (ANI): India's stalwart batter Virat Kohli opened up about the growing impact of cricket in the United States, as they are set to co-host the upcoming T20 World Cup with the West Indies. Cricket has been on the rise in the USA over the past couple of years. The Major League Cricket (MLC) has played a crucial hand in the growth of cricket in the country. Recently MLC became the second Associate Franchise Tournament after the United Arab Emirates' International League T20 to acquire List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\nThe fever of cricket has seen an influx of interest in the USA as the T20 World Cup is just on the verge of commencing. Ahead of the tournament, while talking about the sport's growth in the USA, Kohli stated he never expected to play any cricket format in the USA.\n\n\"Honestly, I never thought that we would be playing cricket in any form in the States. But now it's a reality. That tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world. The United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first one on a global scale to accept it in a way with the World Cup, which is I think it's a great start. It's the ideal way to begin. So I think it's going to have a huge impact,\" Kohli said in a video posted by the U.S. Consulate Mumbai on X.\n\nMLC's debut season in 2023 transformed the landscape of American cricket, bringing world-class domestic T20 action to the United States for the first time with most of the matches played in front of sold-out crowds in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nAfter a successful end of the inaugural season of MLC, the second season will feature top stars from the cricket giants.\n\nKohli talked about the influence of MLC and its potential in developing interest in cricket among the fans and added, \"In starting off a kind of a domino effect and I hope that it carries on for a long period of time. We have enough people as I said from our regions to keep the game up and alive in the States and make the others more aware about what it feels like to play cricket and watch cricket. I think it's got great potential with the MLC as well. There's already franchise cricket happening there. So I think it's moving in the right direction.\"\n\nWashington Freedom will be Australian-stacked in the upcoming season. Top players like Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, and coach Ricky Ponting will feature for the franchise.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns will be bolstered by hard-hitting opening New Zealand batter Finn Allen.
