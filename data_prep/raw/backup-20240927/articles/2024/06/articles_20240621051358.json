        "date": "Wed Feb 22 00:36:49 2023",
        "body": "Steve Smith is reportedly considering a move to America to take part in a new T20 cricket league. Major League Cricket will hold its inaugural season this July, taking part in Texas and North Carolina over a three-week period.\n\nThe six-team league has been bankrolled by a number of heavyweights in India, with a reported AU$174 million invested by Microsoft boss Satya Nardella and Bollywood legend Shah Rukh Khan. Last week, Cricket NSW unveiled a partnership with Major League Cricket that will see American players come over to play in NSW Premier Cricket, and Aussies go the other way to play in the MLC.\n\n'UNUSUAL FOR HIM': Steve Smith's dressing room blow-up revealed\n\n'WHAT A JOKE': Cricket world rages at 'pathetic' Aussie women's farce\n\nCricket NSW has also entered into a partnership with the Washington DC franchise - one of six teams with a $1.5 million salary cap each season. The other teams are based in New York, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, with a number of IPL franchises engaging in similar partnerships with the US teams.\n\n“With the global cricket landscape currently undergoing significant transition, we view the United States as a market with immense growth potential,” Cricket NSW chief executive Lee Germon said last week. “Cricket NSW’s track record in high performance cricket and elite match operations is second to none and we believe we can bring a raft of experience to MLC and the Washington DC franchise in the coming years.”\n\nThe partnership will see Cricket NSW provide players and coaches to the Washington team, which could eventually include Smith. The talismanic Aussie batter won't play in the American T20 League this year due to the Ashes, but is reportedly weighing up a move to the States once he finishes his Test career.\n\nAccording to News Corp, Smith has been in talks with Major League Cricket bosses about making a cameo in 2024. The T20 World Cup will take place in the US and West Indies next year before the Major League Cricket season, opening a window for Smith to stay in the States and play.\n\n“We’ve been in touch with Steve about his plans and what he’s thinking,” MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta told News Corp. “What he’d love to do at some point is play cricket in the US as his schedule permits.\n\n“His view was that if he could make it work and if we could make it work – I know this season, he has commitments. I don’t know what the Australian calendar is next year but I believe there is enough space for him to potentially play.” Long-term … our view is that we might see a lot of him in the US.”\n\nSmith has a second home in New York and a connection to the Big Apple. He popped the question to wife Dani during a holiday there in 2017.\n\n\"The opportunities for all our players is going to be brilliant,\" Germon said. \"Steve has made no secret he loves New York. But there are also two or three other players I have spoken to who would love to play cricket in the United States.\n\n\"We will look to use the players within the Cricket NSW ecosystem to not only highlight the T20 competition and MLC, but cricket in the United States as well. Put it this way - I don't think we'll be short of players putting their hands up.\"\n\nSteve Smith set to finish cricket career in America?\n\nSpeaking last year, Smith flagged the possibility that he might finish his career in America. “There’s obviously leagues popping up everywhere around the world now, and I think you’ll probably see more players in the back end of their career going down that route, so it’s potentially something I’ll look at in the future,” Smith told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n“The US has been a market that cricket’s been trying to get into for some time. So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nAnd it might come sooner rather than later, with Smith revealing in January that he wasn't sure how much longer he wants to play Test cricket. \"We'll see. I'm enjoying it at the moment,\" he told reporters during the SCG Test. \"I really can't say how long I'll play for. I'm not sure.\n\n\"I'll take it one tour at a time, just enjoy it, enjoy training and trying to get better as well. Whilst I'm doing that, I'm happy playing but I don't know how long that'll last.\"\n\nHe later hosed down speculation he is on the verge of walking away from international cricket, but he's clearly thinking about what his future looks like."

        "date": "Thu Jun 20 02:53:15 2024",
        "body": "How the American Cricket Market Can Leverage Opportunities to Draw High-Profile Players\n\nPat Cummins, Australia’s Test and one-day captain, recently made headlines by joining the San Francisco Unicorns in the emerging Major League Cricket (MLC) competition. Despite earning $3.67 million in the IPL, Cummins’ decision to play in the MLC, where players can earn up to $300,000 for a season, was driven by more than financial gain.\n\nCummins saw an opportunity to build relationships with some of America’s most successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. The San Francisco team’s lead investors, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, both Stanford-educated entrepreneurs, played a pivotal role in securing Cummins’ involvement.\n\nThis strategic move highlights the unique selling points that the American cricket market can leverage to attract high-profile players and enhance the commercial appeal of cricket in the U.S.\n\nTech-Savvy Collaborations and Networking Opportunities\n\nOne of the primary attractions for Cummins was the potential to develop deep relationships within Silicon Valley. This region is home to top companies and venture capital firms, offering players like Cummins unparalleled networking and learning opportunities.\n\nCummins’ manager, Neil Maxwell, emphasized this aspect: “He’s a very curious bloke and finds learning about these things really interesting. There’s a range of people connected to this franchise, including CEOs of major companies. It just opens up Silicon Valley.”\n\nThis unique angle can be a major draw for other international players who are looking beyond their cricket careers and want to explore opportunities in technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nEnvironmental Initiatives and Social Impact\n\nAdditionally, Cummins’ involvement with the Unicorns aligns with his environmental advocacy. The opportunity to connect with the tech community in Silicon Valley and engage with California’s green initiatives resonated with his aspirations beyond cricket.\n\nNick Cummins, CEO of Cricket Victoria, who facilitated the signing, noted, “This is so much more than cricket. It’s a chance to connect with the tech community, and align with his work for Cricket for Climate.”\n\nBy emphasizing the broader impact and opportunities for social engagement, the MLC can attract players who are passionate about making a difference off the field as well.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Market Positioning\n\nThe American cricket market can strategically position itself by forming partnerships with tech hubs and promoting the holistic benefits of playing in the MLC. Highlighting the potential for players to network, learn, and engage with leading tech entrepreneurs can significantly enhance the league’s appeal.\n\nMoreover, leveraging the influence of successful entrepreneurs and integrating environmental and social initiatives can create a compelling narrative that attracts both players and fans. This approach not only boosts the commercial lure of cricket in America but also positions the MLC as a forward-thinking and innovative league.\n\nPat Cummins’ decision to join the San Francisco Unicorns underscores the potential for the American cricket market to attract high-profile players through strategic, tech-savvy collaborations and social impact opportunities. By leveraging these unique selling points, the MLC can enhance its commercial appeal and build a robust and dynamic cricket market in the U.S.\n\nThis strategic focus on technology and social impact aligns with Ministry of Sport’s commitment to providing authoritative and engaging insights into the business of sports, inspiring our community to innovate and thrive in the sporting industry."

        "date": "Wed Jun 19 05:50:00 2024",
        "body": "Pat Cummins became Cricket Australia’s first $3 million player last year, and earned another $3.67 million at this year’s IPL, but money had nothing to do with him joining the San Francisco Unicorns in America’s fledgling Major League Cricket competition.\n\nAustralia’s Test and one-day captain was planning some time at home but has instead jumped at the opportunity to build relationships with some of America’s most successful entrepreneurs in nearby Silicon Valley.\n\nThe most an MCL player can earn is about $300,000 for seven regular games and, potentially, two finals. Cummins earned more than $216,000 a match in the IPL.\n\nThe lead investors in the San Francisco team, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, friends from Chennai who completed computer science PhDs at Stanford University and have become successful entrepreneurs, initiated the chase for Cummins.\n\n“Of course we’re huge fans of Pat Cummins and really wanted him to join the team,” Rajaraman told this masthead. “But what really helps us out is how sort of tech-savvy and forward-thinking Pat Cummins is.\n\n“He was thinking of his career beyond cricket, and he’s thinking about how to do interesting things at the intersection of technology and cricket, even after his playing days are done.\n\n“He felt it would be valuable for him to develop deep relationships with Silicon Valley. We are, fortunately, in Silicon Valley, and we can help connect that.\n\n“All the top companies and the top venture capitals are here, and we can help him network and build the kind of knowledge that he wants about start-ups and venture capital and so on. That’s why it kind of worked out.”\n\nCummins’ manager, Neil Maxwell, said the player was excited about the opportunities.\n\n“He’s a very curious bloke, and he likes to learn,” Maxwell said. “He finds that learning about these things is really interesting.\n\n“There’s a range of people connected to this franchise, including the CEO of YouTube, CEO of Adobe. It just opens up Silicon Valley.”\n\nCummins, who is in the West Indies preparing for Australia’s Twenty20 World Cup match against Bangladesh on Friday morning (AEST), may be the world’s only premier fast bowler with a degree in business management.\n\nIt was a strange signing because the Unicorns are supported by Cricket Victoria, while his home state of NSW supports the Washington Freedom. The four other teams in the MLC are run by IPL franchises.\n\nLoading\n\nRajaraman and Harinarayan approached Cricket Victoria chief Nick Cummins about signing the elite paceman.\n\nNick Cummins once worked with Pat Cummins as general manager of the Sydney Thunder, and knew it would take more than another T20 competition to clinch the deal.\n\n“Pat was pretty clear: ‘I’m not looking for more opportunities to play cricket,’” Nick Cummins told this masthead.\n\n“My conversation with him and Neil was more around, ‘This is so much more than cricket, thinking about your aspirations and what you want to do beyond cricket.’\n\n“It’s a chance to connect with the tech community in Silicon Valley, connect with the greenest state in America around what he’s doing for Cricket for Climate [an environmental organisation], and I think that’s what really excited him about it.”\n\nSports news, results and expert commentary.

        "body": "The upcoming edition of Major League Cricket (MLC) has suffered an early blow, with New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell ruled out due to injury. Mitchell's franchise, the Texas Super Kings, have replaced him by signing talented Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad.\n\nMitchell, who was one of the prized overseas signings for Texas ahead of the second MLC season, had been in poor form and was suffering from injuries over the past year. He managed just 36 runs in three innings at theT20 World Cup 2024 as the Blackcaps crashed out of the marquee event in the group stage.\n\nThe 33-year-old had previously missed games for the Kiwis due to a foot injury which ruled him out for the second Test against South Africa in February. Upon returning, he failed to get his best form during a below-average IPL campaign with Chennai Super Kings.\n\nAlso read: 45 Major League Cricket stars to compete in ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024\n\nTexas Super Kings get Marcus Stoinis for second edition of MLC\n\nWith Mitchell now set for a rehabilitation program, Texas have turned to the 19-year-old Noor Ahmad as his replacement. The left-arm wrist spinner has already represented Afghanistan in 10 T20 Internationals, claiming seven wickets at an economy rate of 7.00.\n\nNoor has been a regular on the T20 franchise circuit as well, playing in leagues like the SA20, ILT20, and IPL. He has taken 97 wickets from 96 T20 matches, with best figures of 5/11. The teenage spinner is currently part of Afghanistan's squad at the marquee event.\n\nAlso read: How Pat Cummins’ love for technology lured him to Major League Cricket\n\nMitchell's absence is undoubtedly a big blow for the Texas Super Kings, who had retained him along with former South African captain Faf du Plessis and the Kiwi pair of Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner ahead of the new MLC season.\n\nHowever, they will be happy with the signing of Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis, who was recently crowned the No.1 ranked T20I all-rounder. Stoinis will add further firepower to Texas' already strong batting lineup.\n\nThe 2024 MLC season runs from July 6-29, with the Texas Super Kings opening their campaign against the LA Knight Riders.\n\nTexas Super Kings squad\n\nFaf du Plessis (c), Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, Milind Kumar, Cameron Stevenson, Zia Shahzad, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Mohammad Mohsin, Zia ul Haq, Joshua Tromp, Raj Nannan, Noor Ahmad, Aaron Hardie, Marcus Stoinis, Aiden Markram, Naveen-ul-Haq"

        "body": "New Zealand’s star batter Kane Williamson has made a significant decision, stepping down from the T20I and ODI captaincy while declining a central contract for the 2024-25 season.\n\nKane Williamson prioritizes family and overseas cricket leagues\n\nThis move prioritizes both his desire for more time with family and the pursuit of an overseas cricketing opportunity.\n\nNotably, he is set to be picked by a top team at the SA20 and might also feature in the upcoming Major League Cricket (MCL) in the USA.\n\n“Helping push the team forward across the formats is something I’m very passionate about and something I want to keep contributing towards,” Williamson said in a New Zealand Cricket (NZC) release. “However, pursuing an overseas opportunity during the New Zealand summer means I’m unable to accept a central contract offer.”\n\nWilliamson open to accept the central contract in future\n\nDespite this decision, Williamson remains committed to representing New Zealand and accepting a contract in the future.\n\n“Playing for New Zealand is something I treasure, and my desire to give back to the team remains undiminished,” he said. “My life outside cricket has changed, however. Spending more time with my family and enjoying experiences with them at home or abroad is something that’s even more important to me.”\n\nThis announcement follows a less-than-stellar T20 World Cup 2024 campaign for New Zealand, where they failed to reach the semifinals for the first time since 2014. Williamson remained unclear about his future in T20Is, stating, “On, I don’t know. We’ll see where things land,” when asked about his involvement in the 2026 edition.\n\nBy choosing a casual contract, Williamson will receive a retainer while in the camp with the Black Caps, along with the usual match fees. He is expected to be available for most Tests, potentially missing only the September match against Afghanistan in India (which lacks World Test Championship significance).\n\nThe Black Caps’ forthcoming schedule includes tours of Sri Lanka (Tests and ODIs) and India, followed by a home series against England starting in November. Williamson will likely miss the white-ball matches against Sri Lanka before rejoining the team for the home season opener."

        "date": "Thu Jun 20 13:56:35 2024",
        "body": "The upcoming Major League Cricket (MLC) season faced an early setback as New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell was sidelined due to injury. Mitchell, a key overseas signing for the Texas Super Kings, has been struggling with form and fitness in recent times. His stint at the T20 World Cup 2024 was lackluster, managing only 36 runs across three innings as New Zealand exited the tournament in the group stage. The 33-year-old's troubles extended back to earlier injuries, including a foot injury that forced him to miss the second Test against South Africa in February. His return to cricket thereafter saw him struggle to regain his peak performance, evident in his underwhelming performances for the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL. In light of Mitchell's unavailability, the Texas Super Kings swiftly made a move by signing Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad as his replacement. Ahmad, known for his spin prowess, joins the franchise with expectations to bolster their squad ahead of the MLC season.\n\nMitchell's absence poses challenges for Texas, who had pinned hopes on his all-round abilities. Despite his recent setbacks, Mitchell's experience and potential were seen as valuable assets for the team. However, his recurring injuries and subpar performances necessitated a strategic change, prompting the franchise to opt for Ahmad as a replacement. As the MLC season approaches, the Texas Super Kings will rely on Ahmad to fill the void left by Mitchell, hoping the Afghan spinner can make a significant impact and contribute positively to their campaign.\n\nFollowing Daryl Mitchell's need for rehabilitation, the Texas Super Kings have turned to 19-year-old Noor Ahmad as his replacement. The left-arm wrist spinner boasts international experience, having featured in 10 T20 Internationals for Afghanistan where he has claimed seven wickets with an economy rate of 7.00. Noor Ahmad has also made his mark in various T20 leagues including SA20, ILT20, and IPL, accumulating 97 wickets from 96 matches with impressive figures of 5/11. Currently, he is part of Afghanistan's squad at a major tournament, showcasing his burgeoning talent and potential.\n\nMitchell's absence presents a significant challenge for the Texas Super Kings, who had planned around his contributions alongside key players like former South African captain Faf du Plessis, and New Zealand duo Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner for the upcoming MLC season. Despite this setback, the franchise has found solace in the acquisition of Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis. Recently crowned the top-ranked T20I all-rounder, Stoinis adds substantial firepower to Texas' already formidable batting lineup.\n\nWith Noor Ahmad stepping into Mitchell's role, Texas anticipates his youthful energy and spin expertise will complement their squad dynamics effectively. The team's strategy now pivots towards integrating Ahmad seamlessly into their plans, leveraging his talent to maintain competitiveness throughout the MLC season.\n\nTexas Super Kings Squad"
