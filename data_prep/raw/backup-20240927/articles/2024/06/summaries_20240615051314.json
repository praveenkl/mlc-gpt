        "text": "**Season 2 of MLC**: The second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) will begin five days after the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup, featuring six franchise teams across two venues: Grand Prairie in Texas and Morrisville in North Carolina.\n\n**Success of Season 1**: The inaugural season of MLC was deemed a success, with revenues of $8m and 17,000 spectators across 18 days and 19 matches.\n\n**Team Ownerships**: Sanjay Govil, owner of Washington Freedom, is the only solo owner of an MLC franchise, while three other franchises (Texas Super Kings, LA Knight Riders, and MI New York) are owned by IPL bigwigs. The remaining two franchises, Seattle Orcas and San Francisco Unicorns, have multiple millionaire co-owners.\n\n**Washington Freedom's Progress**: The Washington Freedom team, which partnered with Cricket NSW, finished third in Season 1 and is looking to improve in Season 2 with a new CEO and a strong roster featuring Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, Steve Smith, Marco Jansen, and Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\n**MLC's Goal**: The ultimate goal of MLC is to make cricket a \"semi-mainstream\" sport in the US, comparable to lacrosse or rugby, within the next decade.\n\n**Challenges**: Cricket faces stiff competition from established sports leagues in the US, and MLC will need to break through the noise and grab eyeballs in a multi-sports-league-saturated market.\n\n**Importance of Grassroots Cricket**: Increasing playing numbers from the current 100,000 weekend players, mostly from the South Asian diaspora, is crucial to the growth of cricket in the US.\n\n**Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium**: The Grand Prairie cricket stadium, repurposed from an abandoned baseball venue, will host 16 of the 25 MLC2 matches, with Morrisville's Church Street Park hosting the remaining nine."
