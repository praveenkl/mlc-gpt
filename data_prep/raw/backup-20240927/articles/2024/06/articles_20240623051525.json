Major League Cricket is attempting to build more 7,000- to 10,000-seat stadiums for the sport, with cities like San Francisco — which has a community of 250,000 people originally from South Asia, where the sport is sensationally popular — seen as an ideal site to build a proper stadium for teams like MLC’s San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nPatrick Sisson, The New York Times"

There’s an even bigger sport in town.\n\nThis week, Major League Cricket will play its first-ever game in the U.S. and every last ticket to the highly anticipated opener has been sold. (Don’t worry, it’s also being broadcast live.) The Texas Super Kings will face off against the Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Thursday. The 6,000-person venue replaced the former home of the professional baseball team, the AirHogs. Anurag Jain, the managing partner of venture capitalist firm Perot Jain, is part-owner of the Texas Super Kings and founded the Dallas-based franchise earlier this year in hopes of creating a buzz stateside.\n\nMore from Robb Report\n\nThe Texas Food Scene Can't Decide Whether It Wants a Michelin Guide\n\nA Thief Stole $600,000 Worth of Wine From This L.A. Bottle Shop\n\nThis $37 Million Tuscan-Inspired Estate in Los Angeles Will Transport You to the 1920s Italian Countryside\n\n“My vested interest was to bring cricket right into the heart of America,” Jain told Bloomberg. “I see a lot of cricket being played one off, club level, league level, at the local levels. But not at the professional level and that’s what I really wanted to change.”\n\nCricket is currently ranked as the second-biggest sport in the world right behind soccer, and Jain’s not the only one betting on its future. Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside business mogul Jay Mehta, acquired the Knight Riders back in 2020 and has plans to build his own state-of-the-art cricket stadium 40 miles outside L.A. The $30 million venture is being spearheaded by Major League Cricket and designed by award-winning architecture firm HKS.\n\nHistorically, the bat and ball sport has struggled to develop a fan base outside of India, South Africa, Australia, and the U.K. However, deep-pocketed investors are willing to put an impressive $120 million into the U.S. league to expand its profile in America, Bloomberg reported.\n\nOf course, with this kind of financial backing, cricketers from across the globe want in on the action. The Texas Super Kings have since signed overseas players including Devon Conway, Dwayne Bravo, and David Miller. Veteran South African batter Faf du Plessis has also joined the team as captain, while West Indies spinner Sunil Narine leads the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n“American sports fans want to see the best in the world,” MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport. “That’s the demand in U.S. professional sports.”\n\nSign up for Robb Report's Newsletter.

USA's stand-in captain Aaron Jones has finally gotten a team as the Seattle Orcas added him back to the squad having released him following the inaugural edition of the MLC. Jones was amongst the three supplementary draft picks. LA Knight Riders signed up Chaitanya Bishnoi as the first supplement pick followed by Orcas getting Jones in the second one. The defending champions MI New York added spinner Sunny Patel to their squad as the third supplementary pick.\n\nJones, who has smashed 14 sixes in the ongoing T20 World Cup so far, set the tournament alight on its opening night with a rapid knock of 94* off just 40 balls. Jones is also leading the USA team in the absence of regular skipper Monank Patel, who injured his shoulder after the Pakistan match. Jones rejoins the likes of Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, Michael Bracewell, Obed McCoy, Nathan Ellis, Harmeet Singh and Imad Wasim as the Orcas look to go one better than last year.\n\nAmong the other new signings, New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra has joined his fellow Kiwi Lockie Ferguson and a bunch of Aussies at Washington Freedom. Ravindra, whose stocks have risen since the ODI World Cup in India last year, has taken to all three formats like fish to water and will be hoping to do well in the tournament.\n\nTo add to that Steve Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Sauarabh Netravalkar and Akeal Hosein with Ricky Ponting as a coach, there is already enough star power in Washington Freedom and will be hopeful of a great season."

This provided an opportunity for undrafted domestic players to secure a place in the upcoming tournament.\n\nThe draft order was randomly determined on June 18. Teams were given 48 hours to strategize and finalize internal discussions before the supplementary draft occurred.\n\nPick #1 – LA Knight Riders – Chaitanya Bishnoi\n\nA top-order batsman and spin bowler, the 29-year-old played for the Chennai Super Kings championship side in 2018 before moving to the United States in early 2023. He was part of the San Francisco Unicorns squad in the 2023 inaugural season of Major League Cricket, featuring in all five matches. He also played a key role for the Dallas Xforia Giants during the 2023 edition of Minor League Cricket.\n\nPick #2 – Seattle Orcas – Aaron Jones\n\nJones returns to a familiar dressing room, having played for the Orcas in last year's inaugural Major League Cricket season. The top-order batsman has been instrumental in Team USA's success during the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Jones made headlines throughout Team USA's historic World Cup campaign and was part of the USA's significant victory over Pakistan in Texas. Orcas fans will be hoping for similar performances throughout MLC.\n\nPick #3 – MI New York – Sunny Patel\n\nA right-handed middle-order batsman and leg-spin bowler, Sunny Patel made a notable impact during the 2023 Minor League Cricket season. His contributions with both bat and ball were crucial in advancing the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers to the Championship match, where they lost to the Dallas Mustangs. Patel adds variety to MI New York's domestic player brigade as the only domestic leg-spinner on their roster heading into the 2024 season.\n\nThe draft has set the stage for an engaging second season of Major League Cricket, with new talents ready to showcase their skills on a larger platform.\n\nStory first published: Saturday, June 22, 2024, 13:09 [GST]"

The financial allure of the tournament is notable, with average players earning up to INR 2.5 crore for seven games and a couple of final matches. In comparison, Cummins earned approximately INR 1.8 crore per match during the recent IPL 2024 season.\n\nFor this MLC season, Cummins has been signed by the San Francisco Unicorns. The team’s lead investors, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, are ardent fans of Cummins, and their admiration goes beyond his cricketing prowess.\n\n“Of course, we’re huge fans of Pat Cummins and really wanted him to join the team, but what really helps us out is how tech-savvy and forward-thinking he is. He’s considering his career beyond cricket and is interested in the intersection of technology and cricket, even after his playing days,” Rajaraman told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nALSO READ: White House Applauds USA Cricket Team’s Historic T20 World Cup 2024 Performance\n\nThe alignment of interests in technology played a significant role in bringing Cummins to the Unicorns. The team has connections with prominent figures in the tech industry, including the CEOs of YouTube and Adobe, offering Cummins a unique opportunity to explore Silicon Valley’s innovative environment. Cummins’ manager, Neil Maxwell, emphasized this learning aspect as a major draw for the cricketer.\n\n“He’s a very curious individual who enjoys learning about new things. The range of people connected to this franchise, including high-profile tech CEOs, opens up Silicon Valley to him,” Neil Maxwell explained.\n\nAdditionally, the San Francisco Unicorns are supported by Cricket Victoria, while Cummins’ home state, New South Wales (NSW), backs Washington Freedom. The Unicorns’ investors approached Cricket Victoria’s chief, Nick Cummins, about the signing.\n\nALSO READ: Virat Kohli Prepares for Afghanistan Clash Amid Struggles; Possible Inclusion of Kuldeep Yadav\n\nNick clarified that while Pat is not seeking more cricket-playing opportunities, the chance to delve into Silicon Valley’s tech scene made the offer appealing. The move to the MLC not only broadens Pat Cummins’ cricketing horizons but also allows him to engage with cutting-edge technology and forward-thinking individuals, aligning perfectly with his post-cricket aspirations."

(Source -Getty Images)\n\nThe upcoming edition of Major League Cricket (MLC) has suffered an early blow, with New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell ruled out due to injury. Mitchell’s franchise, the Texas Super Kings, have replaced him by signing talented Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad.\n\nMitchell, who was one of the prized overseas signings for Texas ahead of the second MLC season, had been in poor form and was suffering from injuries over the past year. He managed just 36 runs in three innings at theT20 World Cup 2024 as the Blackcaps crashed out of the marquee event in the group stage.\n\nThe 33-year-old had previously missed games for the Kiwis due to a foot injury which ruled him out for the second Test against South Africa in February. Upon returning, he failed to get his best form during a below-average IPL campaign with Chennai Super Kings.\n\nAlso read: 45 Major League Cricket stars to compete in ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024\n\nTexas Super Kings get Marcus Stoinis for second edition of MLC\n\nWith Mitchell now set for a rehabilitation program, Texas have turned to the 19-year-old Noor Ahmad as his replacement. The left-arm wrist spinner has already represented Afghanistan in 10 T20 Internationals, claiming seven wickets at an economy rate of 7.00.\n\nNoor has been a regular on the T20 franchise circuit as well, playing in leagues like the SA20, ILT20, and IPL. He has taken 97 wickets from 96 T20 matches, with best figures of 5/11. The teenage spinner is currently part of Afghanistan’s squad at the marquee event.\n\nAlso read: How Pat Cummins’ love for technology lured him to Major League Cricket\n\nMitchell’s absence is undoubtedly a big blow for the Texas Super Kings, who had retained him along with former South African captain Faf du Plessis and the Kiwi pair of Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner ahead of the new MLC season.\n\nHowever, they will be happy with the signing of Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis, who was recently crowned the No.1 ranked T20I all-rounder. Stoinis will add further firepower to Texas’ already strong batting lineup.\n\nThe 2024 MLC season runs from July 6-29, with the Texas Super Kings opening their campaign against the LA Knight Riders.\n\nTexas Super Kings squad\n\nFaf du Plessis (c), Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, Milind Kumar, Cameron Stevenson, Zia Shahzad, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Mohammad Mohsin, Zia ul Haq, Joshua Tromp, Raj Nannan, Noor Ahmad, Aaron Hardie, Marcus Stoinis, Aiden Markram, Naveen-ul-Haq"
