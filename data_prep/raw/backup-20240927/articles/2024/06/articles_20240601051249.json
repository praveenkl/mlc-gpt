        "body": "Reports are indicating that a new women’s T20 franchise tournament might soon take place in the United States. Although the idea is still in its nascent stages, key figures in American cricket are eager to leverage a unique opportunity.\n\nThis opportunity arises from the upcoming 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the recent success of the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) men’s T20 tournament.\n\nWith cricket poised to debut in the 2028 Olympics and the USA women’s national team likely qualifying as hosts, there is a growing recognition of the need to foster the women’s game domestically. The recent success of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in India, where international stars have earned substantial salaries, underscores the commercial viability of women’s T20 cricket.\n\nThough the proposed tournament is still in the discussion phase, it would aim to attract top global players and potentially run alongside the existing men’s franchises in the MLC. Owners of several MLC franchises, including the Ambani family who own MI New York, have shown interest in developing women’s teams. This initiative could significantly enhance the profile and earnings of women’s cricketers worldwide.\n\nShould these plans come to fruition, they could impact the international schedules of England’s women cricketers and their participation in domestic tournaments such as The Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has already increased domestic women’s players’ earnings, but these still lag behind the lucrative offers seen in the WPL.\n\nStarting a Women’s T20 Cricket League in the USA: A Major Boost for the Sport\n\nEstablishing a women’s T20 franchise league in the USA would be a landmark event for cricket, providing a stage for the best talent globally to display their skills and potentially inspiring a new generation of American women cricketers.\n\nOver recent years, USA Cricket has made significant strides in the sport. Notably, the upcoming ICC men’s T20 World Cup in 2024 will be the first ICC event hosted in America.\n\nThe development of a women’s T20 franchise league in the USA is seen as a timely and strategic move to enhance the sport’s domestic presence. It represents not only a significant boost for women’s cricket but also an important step in the broader growth and popularity of cricket in the United States.\n\nThe initiative aligns with the global trend of increasing investment in women’s sports, highlighting the growing recognition of women’s cricket as a commercially viable and exciting proposition."

        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the United States.\n\nThe Guardian said the US league now has six franchises but plans to launch two more in the near future, and two more soon after that.\n\nThe announcement comes just after MLC has been fully legitimised by the news that its matches have been awarded List A status by the International Cricket Council.\n\nThe significant development marks yet another crucial milestone in the growth and status of Cognizant Major League Cricket, and cricket more broadly in the United States.\n\nIt recognizes Cognizant Major League Cricket as an official T20 league and America’s first world-class domestic tournament.\n\nNow, every century, half-century, ‘five-for’, run-out, win, loss, and championship will be documented as official career statistics in an internationally recognized format of the game.\n\nThis will also provide local US players and upcoming stars of the game the opportunity for international recognition, furthering the development of domestic talent by the MLC.\n\nThe List-A Status comes after the MLC’s successful inaugural season and underscores its unwavering dedication to delivering premier cricket in the United States.\n\nIn addition to the official List-A status, MLC CEO, Vijay Srinivasan, recently announced aspirations to expand from what began as a 19-game season in 2023 to a 34-game season by 2025.\n\nHe said, “It was always intended to be a 10‑team league. Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nThe Guardian further stated that the move will have significant implications for the landscape of the professional sport in England.\n\nThe second season, which starts at the end of the men’s T20 World Cup, runs for 23 days and overlaps with The Hundred.\n\nThe US tournament next year will be significantly longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC is keen to play in June.\n\nHe said, “Ultimately for us our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer. With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nThat would clash with the T20 Blast season in England but leave The Hundred to run from late July through August.\n\nMLC’s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed that it was the “direction of travel” for the game on 10 May, but there is frustration about slow progress.\n\nMLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local players. It is now working on developing more List A venues. “We’re not here to play a league and go away every year,” Srinivasan said.\n\n“We feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think 10 years from now, I think you’ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we’ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.”\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.

        "body": "Read Also: England Clinches Series Victory\n\nEarly Investors and Launch of Major League Cricket (MLC)\n\nThe US Cricket Board has talked about starting a franchise-based cricket league in 2018. Overcoming the initial hurdles, $120 million i.e. about Rs one thousand crore was raised for the league in May 2022.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, Shah Rukh Khan co-owned IPL franchise KKR, technology entrepreneur Anand Rajaraman, and former Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan were among the early investors. The first season of the MLC was played in July 2023 with 6 teams. All the teams consisted of Indian investors. Actor Shah Rukh Khan is a co-owner of IPL franchise KKR, IndiaWin Sports, the company that runs Mumbai Indians (MI), GMR Sports, the owner of Delhi Capitals, and Chennai Super Kings bought teams with different partners.\n\nStructure and Results of MLC’s First Season:\n\nThe first season of the MLC had 15 group-stage matches played between July 14 and July 26. The four playoff matches took place on July 27, 28 and 30. All 19 games were played at the Dallas and Morrisville stadiums. The group stage saw 6 teams playing 5-5 matches, i.e. one team played a 1-1 match with the other 5 teams.\n\nLike the IPL, the first season of the MLC had the top-4 teams qualifying for the playoffs. MI New York played the final match after winning the Eliminator and Qualifier-2. The team defeated Seattle Orcas by 7 wickets in the final and won the title of the first season.\n\nNicholas Pooran scored a century, he was also the highest run-scorer in the tournament. MI’s Trent Boult took the highest number of 22 wickets. American Cameron Gannon was the Man of the Tournament by taking 11 wickets for Seattle Orcas.\n\nUpcoming Second Season of MLC\n\nThe final match of the T20 World Cup will be held on June 29. Six days after this, the second season of MLC will start in America on July 6. This time also matches will be played in only 2 stadiums, but 21 matches will be played in the group stadium instead of 15. A team will play 7 matches instead of 5. Season 2 of MLC will start immediately after the World Cup, which will connect the global cricket audience with the American audience. The matches of the second season will start at 12:30 pm and 6 am Indian time. According to America, this time it will be night, so more fans will reach the stadium and watch the match.\n\nChallenges for MLC in Competing with IPL:\n\nThe brand value of IPL is Rs 89 thousand crore, while the brand value of MLC is Rs 1 thousand crore. Rs 1,000 crore is spent on the salaries of players in IPL, while only Rs 57 crore is spent on the salaries of players in MLC.\n\nWhile cricket is not among the top 10 most watched sports in America, no other sport is watched more than cricket in India. Major League Cricket (MLC) is currently in its initial stages, where 6 foreign players can play in the playing-11. In comparison, only 4 foreign players play in IPL. The biggest reason for the success of IPL in India is Indian players. Therefore, if MLC has to compete with IPL, it will first have to improve the quality of players in its country. Which now seems to take a lot of time.\n\nThe International Cricket Council approved List-A for Major League Cricket on May 28. This means that now the statistics of players and teams in this tournament will also be counted in T20 records. The second season of MLC will begin on July 6, just 6 days after the T20 World Cup.\n\nIn the second season, there will be an increase from 19 to 25 matches. It is planned to increase to 34 matches by 2025, increasing the number of teams from 6 to 8. The MLC chief executive said the MLC plans to eventually make it a 10-team tournament. Barring the IPL, no country has ever had 10 teams in any franchise tournament. It will be important to see how the T20 World Cup will affect Major League Cricket."

This is second season of the Major League Cricket after their rip roaring success in the first season.\n\nThe announcement came just before the start of the T20 World Cup 2024 which is set to begin in a few days. The United States of America is set to co-host the event along with West Indies and this is the first time the Americans are set to host an event of this nature.\n\nMI New York won the first title by beating Seattle Orcas in the finals by 7 wickets. The second season of Major League Cricket is set to begin on the 5th of July with the finals of the event set to be played on the 28th of July.\n\nDavid Miller signs for LA Knight Riders\n\nSouth African star David Miller who is a well known T20 star is set to play for the Los Angeles based LA Knight Riders for the second season of Major League Cricket. The team is being led by Sunil Narine and didn’t have a great season last year. The Knight Riders finished last in the table with 2 points from five matches.\n\nThis year the very first game for the Knight Riders is against the Texas Super Kings. The addition of David Miller will give the LAKR side a huge boost as the left-handed batter is a huge name in this format of the game.\n\nDavid Miller didn’t have a great season in the IPL with just over 200 runs from 9 matches. The veteran batter will be expected to play a key role for his side during the T20 World Cup and possibly help South Africa win their first ICC title.\n\nThe other notable players in the LA Knight Riders team are Bangladeshi legend Shakib AL Hasan, Jason Roy, Ali Khan, Spencer Johnson, Adam Zampa, and Andre Russell. The Knight Riders will want to ride on the wave of their success as they have recently won the Indian Premier League 2024 title by beating Sunrisers Hyderabad in the finals."
