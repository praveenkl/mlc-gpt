        "body": "Corey Anderson will follow his commitments with the USA national team at the ongoing ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with the San Francisco Unicorns captaincy role for the second Major League Cricket (MLC) season\n\nDomestic star Anderson is taking part in his second season with the Unicorns, having finished the team’s top scorer in 2023.\n\nTickets for all matches are available now at tickets.majorleaguecricket.com.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns has today announced that batting all-rounder and USA international Corey Anderson will captain the side for the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nAnderson, 33, has established himself as a key figure in the Unicorns’ locker room since being drafted for the inaugural 2023 MLC season, in which he finished as the team’s top run scorer with an impressive average of 47.50, while also providing economical bowling support.\n\nCurrently on duty with the USA international team at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, Anderson was part of one of the biggest shocks in cricket history as the hosts beat previous finalists Pakistan after a thrilling Super Over to record back-to-back opening victories.\n\nCommenting on his appointment as captain of the San Francisco Unicorns, Anderson said: “It’s an honor to take the mantle of Unicorns’ captain and lead out a team packed full of talent, including our latest signing Pat Cummins. He brings a wealth of expertise to the group, and I’m looking forward to leaning on him as a mentor when it comes to game strategy and leadership.”\n\n“After experiencing the inaugural MLC season, I have high expectations for 2024 both on and off the pitch, and will be fully focused on delivering success to the growing Unicorns fanbase – once I’ve done all I can to take the USA as far as I can in the current T20 World Cup.”\n\nThe former multi-format representative for New Zealand has made a name for himself with a powerful striking style that once saw Anderson hold the record for fastest ODI hundred in just 36 balls. He has since gone on to earn 38 International T20 caps, averaging 26.41 with a strike rate over 130, and represent various T20 franchises including the IPL’s Royal Challengers Bangalore and Big Bash League’s Hobart Hurricanes.\n\nShane Watson, Head Coach of the San Francisco Unicorns, added: “Corey has been pivotal in shaping this franchise’s DNA since the inaugural season last year. He is a natural leader on and off the field and has an immense amount of experience at the highest level, which translates perfectly into leading the San Francisco Unicorn’s this season.\n\n“I am super excited about building a very successful coach-captain relationship with him.”\n\nPat Cummins, Australia Test and ODI Captain and recent Unicorns signing, said: “The culture of the Unicorns group, put into place by the likes of Corey and Shane, is one of the reasons why I’m here. As a USA international and fan favorite, he’s a deserving captain and I can’t wait to play for him and the rest of the team in July.”\n\nCorey Anderson will lead the Unicorns out in his first match as captain against the LA Knight Riders on July 7, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium, near Dallas, TX – the same venue that saw USA edge out Pakistan – featuring a team packed full of global superstars, including recent signing Pat Cummins, NZ batter Finn Allen, and Pakistani pace bowler Haris Rauf."
