        "title": "A Moment Of Reflection for USA Cricket",
        "date": "Tue Aug 13 15:00:00 2024",
        "body": "“It was a lot of fun.”\n\nThis was a common refrain heard from many international superstars who had descended on American soil to play at the second edition of the U.S. Major League Cricket. Pat Cummins looked as relaxed as he’s ever been, squeezing in rounds of golf between games. Steve Smith, captain of the Washington Freedom was beaming when they capped off a near undisputed season with a decidedly one sided win in the finals defeating San Francisco Unicorns (almost as good a name as the Seattle Orcas) by over a 100 runs. This critic actually fell asleep on the job (Sshhh don’t tell the editors). Was some nail biting too much to ask, Steve? Now I have to use a nail cutter like regular people.\n\nBut that final is ancient history in cricket time. The players have moved on to other assignments with their home countries or at The Hundred (yawns in Brit) and Global T20 in Canada. Sri Lanka defeated India in a bilateral ODI series for the first time in 27 years, dominating by spin. The West Indies test team is still breaking our hearts (the word is limerence, google it). And then you had this minor sporting event called the Olympics but let’s not waste any time on that.\n\nRicky Ponting, the head coach of the Freedom and a forward thinking maverick, sees the United States as a playground for cricket’s future. He urged USA Cricket to push the game at the grassroots level especially for kids.\n\nLocal administrators have already got that ball rolling with multiple initiatives like a minor league that has brought small clubs and teams from across the country under its umbrella. The country has been divided into four zones to allow for easier selection and scouting, given that most US states might not have a strong cricket presence unlike more established cricket playing nations. According to USA Cricket, there are over 400 local leagues with around 200,000 players active around the country.\n\nPlans are afoot to have a rookie league for newer entrants into the sport and age group tournaments with academies to nurture young talent, along with training for umpires and coaches. While still nascent, USA women’s cricket is slowly finding a foothold in the international game.\n\nWhen Ponting spoke about grassroots though, he wasn’t just referring to the usual round of expats and first/second generation immigrants from cricketing countries like South Asia and the Caribbean, but children from all ethnic and cultural groups that call the U.S. their home.\n\nI admire Ponting’s trademark Aussie bullishness but Americans still view cricket as this archaic pastime that they can use as fodder for bad jokes. If only they saw how baseball is a poor substitute, they might change their perspective.\n\nNow that I’ve drummed up controversy, let’s get realistic for a second. Cricket is still very much an expat sport in the U.S.; they hosted an entire World Cup and it barely scratched the veneer of American primetime television.\n\nMillions of Americans watched bemused at Indian techies frothing at the mouth supported men in blue. Grounds and accessibility were woeful especially in New York, and for those who could make it to the venue, ticket prices, upwards of $300 were out of reach. Major League Cricket addresses some of those failings in cost and access. They might spread the gospel of cricket in America but seem to operate in a comfy bubble of expat eyeballs.\n\nFor a beloved sport to be taken seriously in the U.S., this not-so-humble armchair critic feels that there has to be some bombastic cross promotions with other sporting megabeasts like the NBA or the NFL. Good luck getting those behemoths to share airspace but in my dream scenario, I see Steph Curry bowling or Lebron hitting a six out of the ground. If we can get superstars to play cricket and experience its joys, then audiences might start paying attention beyond a distracted guffaw at hearing that a cricket match can go on for five days.\n\nUSA Cricket has an arduous journey ahead, especially after being pulled up by the ICC for “non compliance” with the requirements of the Associate status. Administrators have to produce visionary moves to elevate cricket as a serious sport in the USA. Else, it will just be a bit of fun for international cricketers looking for that U.S. vacay."

Each match will last about 90 minutes.\n\nNCL USA Chairman Arun Agarwal said in the press release, “The NCL USA is reimagining cricket as a global entertainment phenomenon, combining athleticism with the glamour of Bollywood.\n\n“We’re building a world-class venue to host this exciting new era of cricket. North Texas is about to experience a cricket revolution. It's cricket meets Coachella!\n\nThe tournament will take place at UT Dallas from October 4 through October 14.\n\nUT Dallas was chosen as the venue because, according to university President Richard C. Benson, it just makes sense, as many members of the UTD community play and follow the game.\n\n\"We are excited for the opportunity to host alumni and supporters and to introduce newcomers to our university,\" he said in the press release."

        "body": "West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell, who might have played his last on the international stage in the T20 World Cup, opened up on why T20 continued to be a lucrative option for the Caribbean players rather than Test cricket. Russell, who is currently playing in the Hundred for the Lomndon Spirit, had come from the Major League Cricket and as soon as this one is done, will go straight into the Caribbean Premier League for the Trinbago Knight Riders.\n\nRussell suggested that it's not a money issue but most of these players are just not inclined towards playing Test cricket. \"I don't think it's the money, I don't think money is the issue,\" Russell was quoted as saying to the Press Association by ESPNCricinfo. \"Based on the amount of T20 and leagues around the world, I think a lot of players are just not interested in playing Tests,\" Russell added.\n\nAll the big T20 superstars of the West Indies Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard, Rovman Powell and Andre Russell have hardly played Test cricket. The best example of this is Shai Hope, who at one point was touted to take the West Indies forward in Test cricket. One bad series and it just all fell apart and he is nowhere near the Test setup now and has strengthened his position in T20 cricket, even made his IPL debut earlier this year.\n\nThe number of franchise leagues, which have germinated across the world have not only brought up opportunities for the players to play on the big stage but has kept them busy enough and given them money enough to stay on that path only.\n\n\"I'm always excited watching the other West Indian batters, especially when they're hitting boundary after boundary,\" Russell said. \"As long as you can do well from contracts outside your nation I think they are going to grab that opportunity but everyone wants to play on the big stage.\n\n\"So, if the big stage comes in Test cricket, I know youngsters will be happy to play. I just don't think it's about money or anything like that,\" the 36-year-old added, who is still one of the most sought-after players in T20 cricket in the world."

        "body": "Australia's Test captain Pat Cummins plans a return to the Sheffield Shield for match readiness ahead of a challenging series against India starting in late November. After participating in Major League Cricket in the USA, he will miss the white-ball tour of Scotland and England to focus on his fitness. Cummins aims to play one or two ODIs along with a Sheffield Shield game to prep his body for a demanding Test schedule, which includes seven matches over seven weeks. He intends to train intensively to ensure he’s fit for this period, which also includes future contests against Sri Lanka.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nCummins last played in the Sheffield Shield in February 2021, with only nine career appearances.\n\nSeven Tests against India are scheduled, followed by two Tests in Sri Lanka.\n\nYes, But\n\nWhile Cummins prepares thoroughly for the India series, concerns linger about the physical demands of consecutive Tests, particularly given that Australia currently trails India in the World Test Championship standings. Balancing match fitness with injury management continues to be a critical focus for the Australian team.\n\nState of Play\n\nNew South Wales has a Shield game scheduled against Victoria on October 20.\n\nODI series against Pakistan begins in early November, coinciding with another Shield match against Queensland.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nExpect Cummins to finalize his Sheffield Shield participation in late October or early November, which will set the tone for his performance in the India series. The build-up might also see strategic selections for ODIs leading into the Tests, affecting the availability of key players.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCummins' approach to pre-Test preparation emphasizes the importance of match fitness and injury management, as Australia gears up for a crucial series against India, which could be pivotal for their World Test Championship ambitions. His recovery plan reflects a strategic mindset aimed at optimal performance under pressure."

Known for his flawless technique and exceptional leadership, Smith has enjoyed a decorated career on the international stage.\n\nAlthough he last played in the IPL in 2021, Smith’s recent success in Major League Cricket (MLC) suggests he’s far from done.\n\nLeading Washington Freedom to their first-ever MLC title in 2024, Smith not only captained the side but also emerged as the leading run-scorer, accumulating 336 runs at a strike rate of 148.67.\n\nHis match-winning 88 in the final showcased his ability to deliver under pressure, making him an attractive option for IPL teams.\n\nHere are three teams that could benefit from bringing Steve Smith on board:\n\nRajasthan Royals\n\nSteve Smith previously captained RR [X.com]\n\nRajasthan Royals, a team Smith previously captained, might consider rekindling their association with the Australian star. While Sanju Samson leads the side, adding a seasoned leader like Smith to the leadership group could bolster the team’s chances of clinching their second title.\n\nMoreover, Smith’s ability to anchor the innings in the middle order would provide much-needed stability to the Royals, who have often struggled with consistency in that department.\n\nLucknow Super Giants\n\nLucknow Super Giants might bring in Steve Smith [X.com]\n\nLucknow Super Giants (LSG) could be another potential destination for Smith. LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka has a history with Smith, having made him captain of the Rising Pune Supergiants in 2017, a move that nearly resulted in an IPL title.\n\nWith KL Rahul possibly leaving the team, Smith’s leadership experience and tactical acumen could be invaluable. His presence at the top of the order would also add firepower to LSG’s batting lineup.\n\nDelhi Capitals\n\nDelhi Capitals might bring in Steve Smith [X.com]\n\nDespite Smith’s previous stint with Delhi Capitals, the franchise could benefit from his return. Rishabh Pant’s leadership has seen mixed results, and the team has often lacked a steady presence in the middle order.\n\nSmith’s calm demeanor and vast captaincy experience could help stabilize the team’s performance. His ability to adapt and perform under pressure could be the key to turning around Delhi’s fortunes in the IPL."

        "date": "Tue Aug 13 09:33:05 2024",
        "body": "Australian Test captain Pat Cummins is planning a return to the Sheffield Shield to fine-tune his preparations ahead of the crucial Test series against India, scheduled to begin in late November. This decision comes after Cummins recently completed a stint in Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States and has been rested from Australia’s upcoming white-ball tours of Scotland and England.\n\nCummins, who last played in the Sheffield Shield for New South Wales in February 2021, has had limited appearances in four-day domestic cricket throughout his career, with only nine matches under his belt. However, with the demanding home summer approaching — featuring five Tests against India followed by two more in Sri Lanka — Cummins is looking to balance his build-up to these matches while ensuring he remains fresh and injury-free.\n\nFocus on Strength and Conditioning\n\nSpeaking to News Corp, Cummins explained his approach to the coming months, emphasizing the importance of both physical preparation and match readiness. “Ronnie [coach Andrew McDonald] called me the other day and said we need to talk about this,” Cummins said. “I prefer to go a little bit fresher but definitely play some cricket going in.”\n\nCummins outlined his potential schedule leading up to the India series, which may include participating in two or three ODIs against Pakistan in early November, as well as playing a Sheffield Shield match or engaging in some limited-overs cricket for New South Wales. “I imagine kind of late October/early November will be when I start playing, building up for the Tests,” he added.\n\nCritical Test Series Against India\n\nThe upcoming Test series against India is crucial for Australia as it will play a significant role in determining their chances of defending their World Test Championship title at Lord’s in June 2025. Australia currently sits second in the WTC standings, trailing India. With a packed schedule ahead, Cummins and the Australian team management are keen to ensure that the fast bowler is in peak condition to lead the side through a demanding series.\n\nStarc, Hazlewood, and Lyon Also Eye Domestic Cricket\n\nCummins isn’t the only Australian star eyeing domestic cricket as part of their preparation. Mitchell Starc, who is set to play in the ODI series against England after resting from the T20Is, and Josh Hazlewood, who will participate in the entire tour, could also feature for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield ahead of the international season. Additionally, Nathan Lyon is expected to play at least two Shield matches before facing India.\n\nMost of Australia’s top-order batters are likely to be available for the Sheffield Shield in October, providing them with valuable match practice before the Test series. Those not selected for the ODI series against Pakistan could have another outing in the Shield, while two Australia A four-day matches against India A in Mackay and Melbourne will offer further opportunities for fringe players to stake their claims.\n\nPlanning for a Grueling Season\n\nCummins’ return to the Sheffield Shield marks a strategic move to ensure he is both physically and mentally prepared for the rigors of the upcoming Test season. Missing the England tour was a long-planned decision, with Cummins focusing on building strength and conditioning over the next six to eight weeks. “I’ll have a good six or eight weeks off bowling where I’ll get in the gym every day, do some running, and get some strength back into my body,” Cummins said.\n\nWith the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan next February and a busy Test calendar, Australia’s management is carefully planning the workload of their premier fast bowlers to ensure they remain fit and firing for the crucial months ahead. Cummins’ return to domestic cricket will be closely watched as Australia prepares for one of the most anticipated Test series of the year."

The Aussies have current bragging rights, though they sit in second position on the points table to India. With that, Cummins will be eyeing to make a telling difference, hoping the strategic rest and build-up phase would work wonders for his leadership to continue ennobling with all the vigor and elan characteristic of his captaincy thus far."

He has been included in the team's 16-member squad for the upcoming two-match Test series against Pakistan starting from August 21 in Rawalpindi.\n\nShakib last played Test cricket for Bangladesh in May when Bangladesh hosted Sri Lanka for a two-match series.
