        "body": "The USA team has made major changes to its squad for the upcoming tour of the Netherlands. The changes include dropping all-rounder Corey Anderson from both the ODI and T20I teams, as well as letting go of Milind Kumar (T20Is) and Nisarg Patel (both formats).\n\nAnchoring the San Francisco Unicorns’ run to the recent Major League Cricket (MLC) final, Anderson delivered a few standout batting and bowling displays. However, he struggled to maintain consistency throughout the tournament.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar, one of the top performers for USA at the T20 World Cup 2024, has been granted paternal leave to be with his wife and their newborn child. Despite missing several matches in the MLC to be present for his child’s birth, Netravalkar still emerged as the league’s top wicket-taker by a significant margin.\n\nBatter Andries Gous was granted paternal leave for the ODI matches, enabling former India under-19 wicketkeeper-batsman Smit Patel to be added to the squad.\n\nMilind’s lackluster showing at the MLC appears to have worked against him, while Nisarg has struggled to make a meaningful impact lately. While, former India Under-19 captain Unmukt Chand may feel disheartened, as his great performances in the MLC and domestic cricket have not been duly recognized.\n\nThe tour begins on August 13th.\n\nUSA ODI Squad: Monank Patel (Captain), Aaron Jones (Vice Captain), Smit Patel, Abhishek Paradkar, Harmeet Singh, Juanoy Drysdale, Jasdeep Singh, Milind Kumar, Nosthusha Kenjige, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Utkarsh Srivastava, Yasir Mohammad.\n\nT20I Squad: Monank Patel (Captain), Aaron Jones (Vice Captain), Andries Gous, Abhishek Paradkar, Harmeet Singh, Juanoy Drysdale, Jasdeep Singh, Muhammad-Ali Khan, Nitish Kumar, Nosthusha Kenjige, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Utkarsh Srivastava, Yasir Mohammad"

Known for his crucial centuries in the 2023 World Test Championship and the 2023 ODI World Cup finals against India, Head has solidified his reputation as a reliable match-winner. His recent exploits in the IPL and Major League Cricket (MLC) further underscore his exceptional form.\n\nOver the past year, Head has shown remarkable consistency across multiple tournaments. He played a key role in Australia's triumphs in two major ICC events. Head’s recent form has been equally impressive, marked by a stellar IPL season with Sunrisers Hyderabad and a strong showing in the 2024 T20 World Cup.\n\nIn the ODI World Cup final, Head's magnificent 137 runs were pivotal in securing Australia’s sixth title, making him the seventh batter to score a century in an ODI World Cup final. His calm and composed approach in high-pressure situations speaks volumes about his mental toughness.\n\n\"I think in terms of the big matches, just staying nice and calm and relaxed and knowing that my game was in good order helped. I didn't try to overthink things or worry too much about the scenario or the situation or the things that are riding on it,\" Head said.\n\nReflecting on his approach, Head emphasized the importance of not overthinking and focusing on his game.\n\n\"Just going out and playing another game of cricket was the thought process. It was nice to play a semi-final and have two days and then play again,\" he further added.\n\nIn the 2024 IPL season, Head scored 567 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad at a remarkable strike rate of 191.55. His excellent form continued in the T20 World Cup, where he was the third-highest run-scorer with 255 runs. Most recently, Head's 336 runs in nine matches earned him the Player of the Tournament award during Washington Freedom's title-winning campaign in MLC 2024."

        "body": "Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials are still undecided about the inclusion of premier all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan in their upcoming two-match Test series against Pakistan.\n\nShakib, who is currently playing in the Global T20 Canada, earlier expressed his desire to feature in the Test series -- with the first Test scheduled to begin on August 21 in Rawalpindi -- before leaving Bangladesh for the USA to take part in Major League Cricket last month.\n\nHaving been granted NOC by BCB until August 12, Shakib was expected to join the national teammates either in Bangladesh or Pakistan from Canada to prepare for the Test series.\n\nHowever, Shakib, who was a lawmaker in the Awami League government that fell after a student protest on August 5, is no longer an MP following the president's order the next day. Due to the current unrest, he is unlikely to return to Bangladesh anytime soon.\n\nIt remains unclear whether his political identity would impact his selection in the national team. According to sources, Shakib's fitness for red-ball cricket is also a concern as he has been playing non-stop T20 matches since the home series against Zimbabwe in May.\n\n\"Before it was just about whether he [Shakib] could come to Bangladesh and then travel to Pakistan. He's been playing cricket but in a format where he has to score quickly in short time. And even though he knows how to play longer matches, there's a concern about whether he can handle the physical demands [of Test cricket],\" a BCB official told The Daily Star yesterday.\n\nThe selectors, who were unable to contact Shakib over the past week due to unrest situation, are likely to sit with skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in one or two days regarding the matter and other issues about the squad for the Pakistan Test series before they announce their final squad.\n\nIt was learned from another source that BCB has already formed an 18-member preliminary squad with Shakib and pacer Taskin Ahmed being in the team, but the final 15-member squad will be decided after the meeting with all the members of the selection panel, which had to be deferred a few times due to the current unrest situation.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, Cricket Operation In-charge Shahriar Nafees informed that Shakib's inclusion in the Test squad depends both on his availability and selection.\n\n\"He is only a cricketer now,\" Nafees told reporters in Mirpur. \"There is a question of whether he is available for the series now, and another being whether he gets picked for the tour. We will run our activity keeping these two factors in mind,\" he concluded."

        "body": "Sunil Gavaskar was the commentator in the recently concluded Major League Cricket(MLC). The 2nd edition of the league ended with the Washington Freedom defeating the San Francisco Unicorns on July 29.\n\nThe league is expected to increase the popularity of cricket in the USA and also raise the quality of their national cricket team. But the second edition was a glow-down compared to the first one, and Sunil Gavaskar isn’t happy with that.\n\nGavaskar, who is also a former legendary cricketer, felt that the cricket this time lacked quality. The decrease in the crowd might also be due to “fatigue as the USA hosted the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 along with the West Indies.” Gavaskar was talking to The Sportster.\n\n“The crowd was not there this time. Maybe it was due to fatigue, as the USA hosted the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 along with the West Indies. The cricket also lacked quality. There were ordinary players in the franchises. The international stars were also a little casual,” Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar.\n\nSunil Gavaskar Wants Players in 2 More Leagues With IPL\n\nGavaskar also opined that the cricketer ‘should be restricted to three leagues of their choice’.\n\n“Nobody wants the cricketers’ source of income to decrease, but I feel players should be restricted to three leagues of their choice. IPL is the best tournament in the world, and the players should be allowed to choose other T20 tournaments,” he added.\n\nMany of the foreign players are playing in multiple leagues in different countries. This sometimes leads to a situation in which some players sign multiple franchises owned by different owners. It’s a bit odd for the commentator to see players who wear the ‘jersey of a rival IPL franchise in other leagues’.\n\n“Players are playing for one franchise in the IPL and turning up for the rival IPL franchise in the other leagues. It is understandable if the franchise they compete for in the IPL doesn’t have a team in the other T20 leagues, but it is odd to see them wearing the jersey of a rival IPL franchise in other leagues,” he concluded.\n\nThe Indian cricketers who are under the BCCI central contract currently are not allowed to play in any other foreign leagues than IPL."
