        "text": "The second edition of the U.S. Major League Cricket has concluded, with the Washington Freedom winning the tournament comfortably. International stars, including Pat Cummins and Steve Smith, participated in the tournament and had a great time. Despite the success of the tournament, the article notes that cricket still has a long way to go to gain traction in the US. Ricky Ponting, the head coach of the Freedom, emphasized the importance of developing cricket at the grassroots level, particularly among local kids. Efforts are underway to develop the sport, including the creation of a minor league and plans for a rookie league and age group tournaments. However, the article suggests that cricket is still largely an expat sport in the US and that more needs to be done to promote it to a wider American audience. The author suggests that cross-promotions with other popular sports like the NBA or NFL could help increase cricket's visibility in the US."
