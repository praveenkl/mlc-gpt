        "body": "On August 7 (Wednesday), USA Cricket announced their limited-overs squad for the tour to the Netherlands without their superstar Saurabh Netravalkar. Both Netravalkar and Andries Gous have been granted parental leave, with Gous expected to be part of the T20I setup of the tour.\n\nThe selectors have also made the bold call to drop Corey Anderson, who looked in great touch - both with the bat and in the field - during the recently concluded Major League Cricket (MLC) season. However, according to Cricbuzz’s reports, the selectors weren’t too pleased with his inconsistent run.\n\nNisarg Patel and Milind Kumar were both axed from the T20I scheme, with Milind finding himself a place in the ODI setup. A similar treatment was dished out to Shadley Van Schalkwyk, who, too, only finds a place in the ODI setup. However, the selectors continued to place their trust in Sai Teja Mukkamalla, who has made both squads.\n\nAnother major talking point from the squad announcement was the return of 31-year-old wicketkeeper-batter Smit Patel. While franchises overlooked him for the recently concluded MLC, his display in the Houston Cricket League earned him a place ahead of Unmukt Chand, who had a good MLC.\n\nODI Squad: Monank Patel (Captain), Aaron Jones (Vice Captain), Smit Patel, Abhishek Paradkar, Harmeet Singh, Juanoy Drysdale, Jasdeep Singh, Milind Kumar, Nosthusha Kenjige, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Utkarsh Srivastava, Yasir Mohammad.\n\nT20I Squad: Monank Patel (Captain), Aaron Jones (Vice Captain), Andries Gous, Abhishek Paradkar, Harmeet Singh, Juanoy Drysdale, Jasdeep Singh, Muhammad-Ali Khan, Nitish Kumar, Nosthusha Kenjige, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Utkarsh Srivastava, Yasir Mohammad."

        "date": "Mon Aug  5 15:59:39 2024",
        "body": "17\n\nEarlier this week, a former baseball stadium in Dallas witnessed Australia’s cricket legends Pat Cummins and Steve Smith face off for the second time in four days. Despite the thrilling match where Smith’s Washington Freedom defeated Cummins’ San Francisco Unicorns in the Major League Cricket (MLC) finals, it barely made headlines back home.\n\nSmith’s brilliant 88 off 52 balls secured the win at the same Grand Prairie ground that hosted the T20 World Cup opener in June. Interestingly, Cummins holds a little-known dominance over his Test vice-captain, dismissing Smith each time they’ve faced in T20 matches. Their head-to-head record is 4 wickets for 8 runs from 13 balls, all occurring outside Australia.\n\nThe MLC, a two-year-old tournament in a non-Test playing nation, has achieved something Australia’s T20 league has not. “Being in America offers a new experience players are eager to have,” said Michael Klinger, Washington Freedom’s general manager. The short three-week tournament and proximity following the World Cup in America and the Caribbean add to its appeal.\n\nBeyond star power, this MLC campaign showcased an increasing Australian influence. Cricket NSW (CNSW) and Cricket Victoria (CV) took pride as Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns, both not affiliated with IPL groups, extended their high-performance programs to these teams. Klinger and Graham Manou, former CV GM, were involved, and the\n\nfranchises are backed by Indian and Indian-American tech entrepreneurs.\n\nAustralians dominated off-field roles, with Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson as head coaches and Aussie support staff. The final featured eight Australians, including tournament MVP Travis Head and final’s Player of the Match, Smith. American players from these teams experienced the Big Bash, enhancing their professionalism.\n\nCricket Australia’s involvement in MLC is under consideration, eyeing benefits for Australian cricket, especially with cricket returning to the Olympics in 2028. Next month’s KFC BBL draft may see American players like Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar join, marking a new chapter in the Australia-USA cricket relationship.\n\nDriving US cricket growth is its large south-Asian heritage population. The sell-out MLC final and high demand for the ICC World Cup highlight this interest. Ponting believes more grassroots promotion in the USA is needed, targeting young Americans and competing with baseball.\n\nThe MLC faces challenges with venue scarcity and the absence of a women’s league. However, it offers unique opportunities, drawing players like Cummins with Silicon Valley connections. Australian cricketers’ social media posts from the USA also serve as great advertisements for the tournament.\n\nKlinger believes the MLC has an edge over England’s Hundred competition. Keeping the tournament short and impactful will be crucial for maintaining its appeal and attracting top players."
