        "body": "It would seem Dallas can’t get enough of cricket. Or, perhaps, cricket can’t get enough of Dallas.\n\nAfter already playing host to Major League Cricket and several World Cup games this year, North Texas will host even more cricket.\n\nThe National Cricket League will play its inaugural season Oct. 4-14 at UT Dallas’ cricket field, which will be renovated for the occasion, the league announced Monday.\n\n“Cricket’s popularity in the U.S. is on the rise, and this tournament will bring world-class cricket to American shores,” league chairman Arun Agarwal, a local bedding magnate and president of the Dallas Park and Recreation board, said in a news release. “Our collaboration with UT Dallas is a perfect match, combining our expertise in cricket with their facilities to create an unforgettable experience.”\n\nRelated:‘Cricket City, USA:’ Grand Prairie is home to a new sports league with deep ties for many\n\nBased in Dallas, the the National Cricket League brings a new form of cricket to the table called Sixty Strikes. The sport has many forms, including some in which a match may take days to finish. The most popular form is T20, which consists of two 90-minute innings. Sixty Strikes, played in other leagues around the world under the name T10, takes about half as long and promises more scoring and excitement.\n\nThe NCL was formally announced last summer at an event featuring Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, with a tournament planned for December in Lauderhill, Fla., one of the few American cities with a large cricket stadium. A spokesperson for the league the tournament was postponed in order to debut the league in Dallas. The NCL was also attached to the new Roland G. Parrish Park in Cadillac Heights for a tournament in the spring, which was also postponed due to conflicts with the T20 World Cup.\n\nThe October tournament will include six teams and feature several high-profile cricketers, including the West Indies’ Dwayne Bravo, Trinidad and Tobago’s Sunil Narine and Pakistan’s Kamran Akmal, with Vivian Richards and Sanath Jayasuriya serving as coaches.\n\nIn preparation, lighting will be added to UT Dallas’ cricket field along with 2,040 bleacher seats and tented VIP areas. UTD has a thriving cricket scene, with a club, intramural cricket and even one of its own playing for MLC’s Seattle Orcas.\n\n“Many in our UT Dallas community play or follow the game, so bringing this innovative tournament to campus is a natural fit,” UT Dallas president Richard Benson said in a news release.\n\nCricket is gaining ground in the U.S., in part due to growing South Asian communities that carry with them a passion for the sport. MLC has played a successful first two seasons primarily at a state-of-the-art facility in Grand Prairie, while the U.S. men’s cricket team had its day in the sun when it upset juggernaut Pakistan at the T20 World Cup in June.\n\n“Earlier this year, Texas hosted the first ever T20 Cricket World Cup in the United States, and our great state has welcomed the Major League Cricket and National Cricket League,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a news release. “As cricket expands its global fanbase, Texas will hold front-row seats to its growth across the nation.”"

        "body": "Pat Cummins will briefly play domestic cricket before the Test series against India later in the year. Cummins, Australia’s Test captain, could feature in the Sheffield Shield competition to tune up for the India series that begins in late November.\n\nCummins, who recently played in the Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA, has been rested from Australia’s white-ball tour of Scotland and England next month.\n\nInstead, he will spend time on strength and conditioning ahead of the home summer with the five Tests against India, spread across seven weeks, followed shortly after by two more games in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe seven Tests will decide whether Australia will have the chance to defend their World Test Championship (WTC) title at Lord’s next June. They are currently second in the standings - behind India.\n\nCummins last played the Sheffield Shield for New South Wales in February 2021. There is also an ODI series against Pakistan in early November which could be used as part of the preparation for the Test matches.\n\n“Ronnie [coach Andrew McDonald] called me the other day and said we need to talk about this,” Cummins told News Corp. “I prefer to go a little bit fresher but definitely play some cricket going in.\n\n“So I’d say it’s either two or three ODIs, plus a Shield [game] or maybe just some Shield, maybe some NSW one-day stuff. I imagine kind of late October/early November will be when I start playing building up for the Tests.”\n\nNSW play a Shield game against Victoria from October 20 then face Queensland from November 1, although the latter overlaps with the ODI series against Pakistan.\n\nCummins has already revealed that missing the England tour was a pre-planned move and that the next few months were about ensuring his body was right for the upcoming workload which will also include the Champions Trophy next February in Pakistan.\n\n“I’ll have a good six or eight weeks off bowling where I’ll get in the gym every day, do some running, and get some strength back into my body,” he said.\n\nMitchell Starc, who will play the ODI series against England after resting from the T20Is, and Josh Hazlewood, who will feature in the whole tour, could also be available for New South Wales ahead of the international season. Nathan Lyon is expected to play at least two matches before facing India.\n\nMost of the batters are expected to be available for the Sheffield Shield in October which features two rounds while those who aren’t part of the ODI side against Pakistan could get another outing. There are also two Australia A four-day matches against India A in Mackay and Melbourne."

The same goes for the batters. There are also a couple of ‘A’ games between Australia and India before the main tour and it won’t come as a surprise if some of the big names from both teams feature in that series."
