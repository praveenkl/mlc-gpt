        "date": "Wed Jul 31 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Sanjay Krishnamurthi, a 21-year-old cricket player, captured attention during Major League Cricket's 2024 season by scoring 79 runs off 42 balls to secure a win for the San Francisco Unicorns against the Washington Freedom. This moment showcased the emerging talent within American cricket, especially among US-born players. Born in Arizona and later moving to Bangalore, his cricket journey began watching the 2011 World Cup, leading to a shift from left-arm spinner to a powerful hitter. After joining a USA cricket training camp and making his international debut in 2021, Krishnamurthi's understated demeanor and performance under pressure highlighted his growing skill set while emphasizing that success is about staying composed.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nSanjay scored 79 runs off 42 balls in the significant MLC 2024 game.\n\nHe has played three One Day Internationals (ODIs) since his debut in 2021.\n\nYes, But\n\nWhile Krishnamurthi's talent is undeniable, critics may point out his relative lack of experience in high-pressure situations, suggesting the need for ongoing development. The competition in American cricket continues to intensify, presenting both opportunities and challenges for young players.\n\nState of Play\n\nMajor League Cricket just wrapped up its second season as a growing platform for talent.\n\nUS-born cricketers are starting to gain prominence, with Krishnamurthi leading the way.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nAs Krishnamurthi continues to hone his skills, opportunities may arise for him to represent the USA at larger international tournaments, potentially influencing the future of American cricket.\n\nBottom Line\n\nKrishnamurthi's rise symbolizes the budding promise of American cricket, suggesting that with continued support and exposure, US-born players can make significant impacts on the international stage."

        "date": "Fri Aug  2 15:21:08 2024",
        "body": "Former Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has raised serious concerns following the conclusion of the second edition of Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024), which was won by the Washington Freedom after beating the San Francisco Unicorns in the final at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nGavaskar was in the US as part of the broadcast team for the recent Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024), where he witnessed drastic changes. He has expressed his disappointment over the MLC’s overall quality, despite several international stars featured in the league.\n\nSunil Gavaskar criticizes Major League Cricket 2024 after witnessing a decline in standards and attendance\n\nThe former Indian captain highlighted a significant decline in the MLC’s standards compared to its inaugural season. He pointed out that the lackluster crowd turnout for the MLC 2024 was almost opposite to the enthusiastic attendance seen during the first edition of the tournament.\n\nEven Gavaskar has suggested a major overhaul to restore the tournament's prestige, including imposing restrictions on players' franchise T20 league involvement to maintain a higher level of competitive cricket and deliver world-class entertainment to the fans.\n\nSunil Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar: “For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual.”\n\nPlayers should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues: Sunil Gavaskar\n\nGavaskar suggested that players should be limited to participating in only three T20 leagues in the world to maintain the high standards and competitiveness of the franchise tournaments. He said that IPL is the world’s best league and nobody wants to leave it, so the players must be allowed to play in the other two leagues in the world.\n\nHe added, “While nobody wants the players’ source of income to be curbed, I feel it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in three leagues of their choice. The IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So, the player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice.”\n\nExplaining his point of view, Gavaskar pointed out that players often compete for one IPL franchise while representing a rival IPL team in other T20 leagues. This situation is understandable if the player's IPL team doesn't have a team in the other leagues, but it seems strange to see players wearing the jersey of a rival IPL team in these other leagues.\n\nGavaskar signed off by saying, “Players are playing for one franchise in the IPL and turning up for the rival IPL franchise in the other leagues. It is understandable if the franchise they compete for in the IPL doesn’t have a team in the other T20 leagues, but it is odd to see them wearing a jersey of a rival IPL franchise in other leagues.”"

        "date": "Sat Aug  3 04:14:00 2024",
        "body": "At a former baseball stadium in Dallas earlier this week, Australia's greatest male bowler and batter of their generation went head-to-head for the second time in four days.\n\nWhat shaped as a pair of captivating duels between Pat Cummins and Steve Smith hardly rated a mention in their home country as the Smith-captained Washington Freedom trumped Cummins' San Fransisco Unicorns in the Major League Cricket (MLC) finals.\n\nDespite Smith's match-winning hand of 88 off 52 balls in the tournament decider at the same Grand Prairie ground that hosted the T20 World Cup opener in June, Cummins maintained a little-known hold over his Test vice-captain in both the decider and a preceding qualifying final.\n\nIn the four T20 matches in which Smith has faced up to his long-time teammate, Cummins has dismissed him each time. Their head-to-head record stands at 4 wickets for 8 runs from 13 balls across their four encounters in the IPL, and now the MLC.\n\nIt's a fact few fans down under will be aware of (nor seemingly was San Fransisco skipper Corey Anderson, who failed to bowl Cummins through the middle overs of the final's first innings while Smith ran rampant) because none of their previous T20 encounters have been in Australia. Nor have they played together in a domestic T20 down under.\n\nSo how has a two-year-old tournament held in a non-Test playing nation been able to achieve something Australia’s own T20 league has not?\n\n\"It's new – being in America is obviously different to being in Australia, and having that experience is something players are really keen on having over here,\" Michael Klinger, the former first-class batter who is now the Washington Freedom general manager, told cricket.com.au.\n\n\"The other thing, which is pretty obvious, is it's a short tournament. It's a three-week tournament and players of that ilk, they're not coming for the money. They're coming for the experience. They don't need the money.\n\n\"This year was unique as well because the tournament was on the back of a World Cup which was played in America and the Caribbean, so lot of these players were already quite close to where we were playing.\"\n\nThe value of Australia’s star power aside, what this latest MLC campaign also revealed was how an increasing number of Australians are driving the fortunes of MLC.\n\nIt was a source of pride for Cricket NSW (CNSW) and Cricket Victoria (CV) that this year's finalists – the only two (of six) MLC teams not affiliated with IPL ownership groups – are basically extensions of their own high-performance programs.\n\nWashington Freedom are aligned with CNSW, where Klinger was until recently its head of male T20 cricket, while San Fransisco Unicorns have a similar partnership with CV, whose current general manager of cricket, Graham Manou, also attended the tournament.\n\nThe Washington and San Fransisco franchises are owned by Indian and Indian-American tech entrepreneurs, but CNSW and CV receive funding from the clubs in exchange for providing high-performance expertise and personnel.\n\nBoth teams' off-field staff are almost entirely made up of Australians. Ex-Test stars Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson are the team’s respective head coaches, complemented by Aussie support staff in Cameron White, Shawn Bradstreet (Washington), Ben Rohrer and Adam Griffith (San Fransisco). MLC's tournament director is Canberra-born Justin Geale, while San Fransisco's GM David White, CV's former head of community cricket, works with Manou in running the Unicorns.\n\nOf the 22 players who featured in the final on Monday morning (AEST), eight were Australian. A further eight took part in the competition. Travis Head was the tournament's most valuable player, while Smith was player of the match in the final.\n\nOn the flipside, many of San Fransisco and Washington's local American players had travelled to Australia during last summer's Big Bash.\n\n\"We made sure that they were exposed to the professionalism of high-level cricket, which not all of them had been exposed to, and play some games against high-quality opposition,\" said Klinger.\n\n\"To have them exposed to that no doubt has given us an advantage. Just from observing this tournament, it looks like at Washington Freedom and even San Francisco Unicorns, the local players have been the best in the competition.\"\n\nIn essence, the state associations are selling the success of Australian cricket.\n\nThat has not gone unnoticed; it is believed Cricket Australia is considering how it might have its own involvement in MLC, and there is an overriding desire to find tangible benefits for Australian cricket from the game’s growth in the USA, particularly ahead of cricket’s return to the Olympics at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\nMore immediately, that may come as soon as next month's KFC BBL overseas player draft, according to Klinger.\n\nA host of American players, including some who helped USA pull off their shock win over Pakistan that fired them into the T20 World Cup's Super Eights stage in June, will be up for grabs.\n\nAnderson, the former New Zealand international, featured for Hobart Hurricanes last season, but the likes of South Africa-born Andries Gous and former India U19 paceman Saurabh Netravalkar featuring in this summer's BBL would mark a step forward in the Australia-USA cricket relationship.\n\n\"I reckon there's going to be a few getting picked up,\" Klinger said. \"There's two in our team who I think (are good chances). Andries Gous a wicketkeeper-batsman who obviously did really well in the World Cup.\n\n\"Netravalkar – he was the leading wicket-taker over here and did well in the World Cup as well, a left-arm bowler who can bowl with the new ball and bowl variations at the death. I thought Hassan Khan from the Unicorns, a left-arm orthodox bowler and left-hand middle-order batter, could provide a team with a great option as well.\n\n\"Teams would be crazy not to have a look at them, especially with the lack of high-end talent coming into the draft this year from overseas. I think having those guys at the middle to the lower levels will add a lot to some teams.\"\n\nDriving the growth of US cricket has been the country’s large population who have south-Asian heritage.\n\nThe sell-out MLC final in Dallas underlined that community’s strong interest in the game, as did the enormous demand for tickets for the ICC's showpiece World Cup moment, the India-Pakistan match at a 'pop-up' stadium in New York.\n\nPonting believes more still more can be done by both the MLC and the ICC to develop the game among young Americans.\n\n\"I think there's a still a role for the players and the franchises. I think the World Cup missed a trick as well in not promoting the game more at grassroots level, getting into schools,\" Ponting, a broadcast commentator during the World Cup, said before the MLC final.\n\n\"That's where I think the next stage and growth will come from. This generation of American cricket fans, we can't just sit back and hope that they're going to promote the game.\n\n\"I think the game needs to do what it can to get out amongst kids. Baseball is such a big game for youngsters here in the US … (but) you go to a baseball game, it's four hours, there's not a lot of excitement that happens. I think it's less than one home-run hit per game.\n\n\"If you look at it that way, compared to what an entertainment package of three hours of cricket can bring to a younger generation, that's the way we should be looking at trying to promote the game here.\"\n\nThose involved in recruiting the game’s best cricketers to their nascent league, are realistic about the road ahead, with Klinger pointing out next year’s international schedule may not be as kind to the competition.\n\nThe scarcity of viable venues – this year’s MLC was played at just two, in Dallas and in Morrisville, North Carolina – is another concern. There is also no women’s MLC, though the BBC has reported discussions on an American women’s league are in their infancy.\n\nFor the world’s best men’s players, however, the MLC offers advantages its competitors cannot.\n\nCummins spoke openly about how the Unicorns owners’ links to Silicon Valley and the venture-capital industry was a major draw for him in signing a four-year deal with the team – an unprecedented move for a current Australian Test captain.\n\nCummins and Fraser-McGurk's filmed Zoom call with Travis Bazzana, a former junior cricketer from Sydney who last month became the first Australian to be taken with the number one pick in the Major League Baseball draft, was another 'only in America' moment.\n\nAustralian cricketers' social media posts of playing golf at some of the world's best courses, attending MLB games, eating southern barbeque, and even going to a Morgan Wallen concert, were shrewd advertisements of a trip to the USA.\n\nIn this respect, Klinger is bullish that the MLC is ahead of England's soon-to-be-privatised Hundred competition. \"Players are choosing it over the Hundred at the moment,\" he said.\n\n\"Who knows what happens in the future, that could change. In an ideal world I'd love to have those two tournaments separated. Potentially with the privatisation of the Hundred, there may be some duplicate owners in both leagues, if that's IPL setups or other setups.\n\n\"A short tournament where they can have maximum impact certainly helps (the MLC's appeal). It's going to be key for MLC down the track not to get too greedy and start to play too many games and make the tournament go longer.\n\n\"If they do that the likelihood is the best overseas players might not want to come. We've got to find that balance of keeping the tournament quite short and sharp and attracting the best players.\""

        "body": "Writing in his column for Sportstar, Gavaskar gave his opinion on the recently-concluded season of Major League Cricket, the second in the league's history. Gavaskar was present at the tournament on commentary duty.\n\nGavaskar: MLC international stars seemed a little casual\n\n\"The Major League Cricket, where I had the pleasure of commentating, has a new winner, with the Washington Freedom franchise winning the trophy. For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe, because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual.\"\n\nGavaskar took the chance to put forward a solution to his perceived casual attitude of the star overseas players: \"This makes one feel that while nobody wants the players’ source of income to be curbed, it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in, say, three leagues.\n\n\"The whole world agrees that the IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So maybe a player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice.\"\n\nInterestingly, Gavaskar's comments come soon after a meeting between the BCCI and IPL team owners, at which the franchise owners sought to crack down on overseas players pulling out of the tournament despite being picked in the auction, reportedly suggesting a two-year ban if they pull out without a good reason (injury or international/family commitments).\n\nWhat are the existing restrictions in place?\n\nFranchise T20 leagues have been in the spotlight recently, as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) denied no-objection certificates to centrally-contracted players Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afridi to take part in the Global T20 league in Canada. Saim Ayub and Azam Khan have also not been given NOCs for the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nThe PCB has a formal policy written into players' central contracts, that they are allowed to play only in the Pakistan Super League, and two further franchise leagues in a given season.\n\nThe BCCI is another board that imposes restrictions on its players. India men's players are not allowed to participate in overseas franchise T20 leagues, unless they retire and forego the chance to participate in the IPL. However, India women's players have taken part in the Women's Big Bash League, the Women's Hundred and Women's Caribbean Premier League, to name a few.\n\nThe reason for this policy is believed to be that the presence of Indian players in the IPL makes it unique, and increases the value of the product overall. Most other cricket boards do not place such blanket restrictions on their players.\n\nThere have been increasing calls of late for a governing body such as the ICC, to introduce centralised regulations for franchise T20 leagues to ensure better coordination and manage players' workloads and movements better."

        "title": "MLC vs The Hundred - Which Competition Has The Better Overseas Players?",
        "date": "Fri Aug  2 12:10:00 2024",
        "body": "The overlap between the two competitions has caused significant disruption in the overseas player marker, with several marquee names not available for the start of The Hundred.\n\nMajor League Cricket: New kid on the block, but an attractive option\n\nAlthough the MLC is only in its second season, it has a huge volume of high profile international names on its roster. The most notable of these this season was Pat Cummins, who announced he would captain San Francisco Unicorns ahead of the tournament for its entirety, and on a multi-year basis until 2027. This was a significant coup for the youngest franchise league on the circuit to snap up the Australia captain, but also a blow for The Hundred that its biggest rival was able to attract the biggest names in the world.\n\nThe overseas names in MLC are second only to the IPL. To name just a few of the regulars on the franchise circuit who played in the tournament this year, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Trent Boult, Dwayne Bravo and Glenn Maxwell are some of the most well-known.\n\nHowever, where MLC has overtaken the Hundred is in its ability to attract either centrally contracted overseas players who are limited in the number of franchise tournaments they play. For example, South Africa players Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada and Heinrich Klaasen all picked up stints in the MLC. As did Australia's Alex Carey, Marcus Stoinis, Steve Smith and Travis Head.\n\nHaving multiple such high profile names in a squad means even below the elite level, the pool of overseas players is deep. For The Hundred, that does not exist this year. Several of the most high profile names dropped out before the tournament began. Shaheen Shah Afridi was set to play in the competition but withdrew at the beginning of the summer. The same happened with Naseem Shah as the PCB tighten their NOC regulations. With fewer international heavy weights and the overseas players beneath them short on star quality, there's no doubt the MLC overseas roster is far superior.\n\nWhy does The Hundred lag behind MLC?\n\nThere is a significant overlap of players who played in the MLC also playing in The Hundred once their obligations in the USA are fulfilled. Rashid Khan flew over after the conclusion of the MLC to reprise his place in Trent Rockets' squad. Adam Zampa did similar. But, in the gap before the highest profile names flew over, the tournament was notably less competitive.\n\nThere are several reasons why The Hundred has fallen so far off MLC in terms of overseas players. Firstly, the rules of MLC are specifically designed to bring in top quality talent from overseas, with cricket still a minority sport in the USA. Each franchise can have up to nine overseas players, with a maximum of six in an XI.\n\nFor The Hundred, only three overseas players are allowed in a squad. Not only is there simply more space for overseas players, but as more names join the competition, the quality of the cricket is guaranteed to be better with marquee players often making up more than half of each side.\n\nThe spectre of the IPL looms large\n\nThe IPL factor is also important. Four of the six MLC teams are owned by franchises with teams in the IPL. Players with contracts in one competition to a franchise with a presence in another have an easier way-in to a competition than those who don't. They can also go lengths to securing their place in another franchise competition they want to play in, like the IPL through playing for a franchise with a team in that league in a competition like MLC.\n\nIn many ways, particularly looking at the advances of competitions like the SA20 and MLC, franchise competitions who do not have some element of IPL team ownership are rapidly falling behind.\n\nRead more: Five uncapped players who England could pick for the Australia white-ball series\n\nThe timing of MLC this year also could not have been more perfect to attract the biggest names. With the T20 World Cup held in the Caribbean, it was a convenient hop over after the end of the tournament. There's also been a lack of international cricket outside of the England v West Indies Tests, meaning most players could afford to pick up a paycheque in a league before rejoining their national squads.\n\nWith the perfect conditions created this year for a tidal wave of overseas stars to add glitz to MLC, it's left The Hundred in a difficult position playing catch-up."

        "body": "The owners of Chennai Super Kings also own Joburg Super Kings in the SA20 League and the Texas Super Kings in the Major League Cricket. Usually, they try to find a common batch of cricketers who represent them in all these leagues. Hence, if they have signed a player for one tournament, more often than not, this player will also be targeted for their squad in another league. On that note, here, we take a look at the list of two new Joburg Super Kings players whom CSK should target for IPL 2025.\n\n1) Jonny Bairstow\n\nJonny Bairstow was a big move by JSK for SA20 2025. With Reeze Hendricks not doing so well, the team had to work on the top order. They had retained Faf du Plessis and now, they have pulled off a coup by partnering Jonny Bairstow with him at the top of the order.\n\nJonny is an excellent T20 cricketer and would straightaway add value to the side. He has loads of experience and on his day, he could easily win a game for his side. Therefore, CSK should also target the cricketer and also because he can keep wickets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Tabraiz Shamsi\n\nTabraiz Shamsi is one of the new Joburg Super Kings players whom CSK should target for IPL 2025. It has been a while since CSK has had a good leg-spinner in the side. The last option they had was Imran Tahir and it was quite a few years ago. For the pitch at Chepauk, a good leg-spin option is a must.\n\nJSK executed a brilliant trade by bringing Shamsi to the franchise. Along with Imran Tahir, he would form a brilliant partnership in the spin department. Shamsi can surely weave his magic at a venue like Chepauk. He offers variety, as well. The South African cricketer is a passionate man and would be a top choice for CSK, too."

        "date": "Fri Aug  2 06:30:58 2024",
        "body": "Former Indian batter Sunil Gavaskar opined on the Major League Cricket’s (MLC) quality drop after the end of the second edition recently. The Washington Freedom became the champions after defeating the San Francisco Unicorns at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas. Gavaskar was a part of the broadcast team that covered the tournament. However, he was disappointed with the quality of the event, despite the several reputed international players participating.\n\n“For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe, because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual,” Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar.\n\n“This makes one feel that while nobody wants the players’ source of income to be curbed, it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in, say, three leagues. The whole world agrees that the IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So maybe a player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice,” he also stated.\n\nHowever, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) currently have a rule in place that only allows players to take part in a fixed number of overseas leagues apart from the Pakistan Super League (PSL). With the Major League Cricket having as many as three franchises backed by IPL franchise owners, there are instances of players playing for their sister teams as well.\n\n“It is also a bit strange to see players who play for one franchise in the IPL playing for the team of another rival IPL franchise in the other leagues. It is perfectly understandable if the franchise they play for in the IPL does not have a team in the various countries’ T20 leagues, but it does seem odd to see them wearing the jersey of a rival IPL team franchise in the other leagues,” Sunil Gavaskar again added in his column."

        "body": "DALLAS, TX (JULY 29, 2024): In a spectacular display of power hitting and strategic bowling, Washington Freedom claimed the Cognizant Major League Cricket 2024 trophy with a commanding 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in the Championship final at Grand Prairie Stadium on Sunday.\n\nLed by stellar performances from Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell, Washington Freedom set an imposing target of 208, which proved insurmountable for the Unicorns. In desperate need of a strong start, the Unicorns faltered early. Jake Fraser-McGurk (3) was dismissed in the third over, and Marco Jansen delivered a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen (13), who had scored a century in the qualifier. At 30/3, the Unicorns were in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued with Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) falling early, dashing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then finished the job with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the match, Washington Freedom had lost Travis Head (9) early. Steve Smith (88) then took center stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock. He found support from Andries Gous (21), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without making significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, easily finding the boundary.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40) joined Smith, and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith’s departure, followed shortly by Maxwell’s, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. Washington Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nWashington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) defeated San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs."

        "date": "Fri Aug  2 10:52:00 2024",
        "body": "It was a wonderful campaign for Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket as we won our maiden title in the 2024 season.\n\nWe were the first team to qualify for the Playoffs of MLC 2024 and also topped the points table after the league phase, with 11 points from seven games. It was a clinical performance as we won both our Qualifier and Championship matches to cap off a memorable season.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the major highlights for the Freedom squad this season.\n\nThe Aussie Flavour\n\nHead coach Ricky Ponting and assistant coach Cameron White took over the coaching duties at the start of the season. The signings of captain Steve Smith, Travis Head, and Glenn Maxwell, along with the coaching duo, brought the competitive edge that Australia possesses in international cricket.\n\nThe results were evident as the Aussies contributed significantly to our campaign, and we won seven out of nine matches in the entire season, with one match being abandoned due to rain.\n\nConsistent Performances\n\nFreedom showed consistency right from the get-go, making it to the Playoffs in both seasons. We finished third in the points table in MLC 2023 before losing to MI New York in the Eliminator.\n\nIn MLC 2024, we took a step forward by finishing at the top of the points table and won the Championship against the San Francisco Unicorns, demonstrating a marked improvement in our performance.\n\nPerfect start in the league stage\n\nWe had an excellent start to our MLC 2024 campaign, winning 5 of our first six matches in the league phase, with one match being abandoned due to rain. This helped us race off the blocks quickly, giving us the winning momentum and making us the first team to qualify for the Playoffs.\n\nThe convincing margins of our victories also ensured that we finished at the top of the points table with a better net run rate, although the San Francisco Unicorns also finished level on points with us. The top-two finish also gave us the chance to directly qualify for the Championship match by winning the Qualifier.\n\nSmith and Head: The Run Machines\n\nSteve Smith and Travis Head were in top form in MLC 2024, scoring more than half of our total runs this season. A majority of our large wins owed to the brilliant starts provided by the opening duo during the powerplay. Both batters had a breakthrough season this year finishing joint-second in the overall batting charts with 300-plus runs.\n\nSmith amassed 336 runs from nine matches at an excellent average of 56.00 and a strike rate of 148.67 whereas Head also tallied 336 runs from as many matches at an average of 48.00 and an astonishing strike rate of 173.19.\n\nTravis Head’s 5-consecutive fifties\n\nTravis Head had a dream debut season in Major League Cricket with the Freedom squad. Though the southpaw started slowly getting a meagre 33 runs from his first three matches, his next five matches produced a mammoth 294 runs, including five fifties, at a mind-boggling average of 73.50 and a strike rate of 176.05.\n\nIn the process, Head also created a breathtaking record in MLC, a run of five consecutive fifties, a feat which no batter has managed in the tournament. The last of those knocks saw him smash an unbeaten 77 off just 44 balls against the Unicorns in the Qualifier, Head’s highest score in the MLC.\n\nTravis Head, deservedly, finished as the Player of the Tournament in our victorious MLC 2024 campaign.\n\nBowling in partnership\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar finished as the highest wicket-taker in MLC 2024 with 15 wickets from only seven matches at an average of 13.46 and a strike rate of 10.53. But what impressed more was the performance of the supporting cast consisting of Rachin Ravindra, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell, all finishing with a tally of 10 or more wickets.\n\nRavindra’s left-arm spin accounted for 12 wickets from six innings at an unbelievable average of 6.08 and a strike rate of 7.58. The Kiwi took two four-wicket hauls and his 4/11 against the Unicorns in the Qualifier were the best bowling figures, both in his T20 career as well as in MLC 2024.\n\nMarco Jansen was impressive with the new ball providing crucial breakthroughs for us throughout the competition. He ended the MLC 2024 with 11 wickets from eight matches striking under every 17 balls he bowled.\n\nJansen’s three wickets in both the Qualifier as well as the Championship prevented the Unicorns’ big-hitting top order from breaking free and restricted them to modest totals.\n\nGlenn Maxwell and Lockie Ferguson also finished with 10 wickets each from eight and seven matches respectively to round off an excellent bowling performance for us this season.\n\nThough Jasdeep Singh and Andrew Tye played only two matches for us in MLC 2024, they shone in the limited opportunities they had by picking up six and five wickets, respectively. Jasdeep finished as the Player of the Match in both matches he played during the season, with impressive three-wicket hauls in each.\n\nThe three-dimensional players\n\nGlenn Maxwell and Rachin Ravindra provided depth and balance to the side with their multifaceted skill sets. Both players could change games with the bat, ball or with their fielding.\n\nApart from his bowling exploits, Maxwell accumulated 153 runs from five innings at an average of 38.25 and a sensational strike rate of 164.51. His game-changing knock of 54 off just 23 balls against the Unicorns in the Qualifier showcased his big-hitting prowess.\n\nRavindra scored 99 runs in the tournament at a strike rate of 137.50, his whirlwind knock of 31 off 14 balls, which included 20 runs from a Trent Boult over, against the MI New York being his best effort.\n\nBoth were gun fielders too, taking crucial catches and saving important runs."

We saw some all-round performances throughout the season as three of our bowlers and two batters finished in the top-five overall bowling and batting charts.\n\nHere is a look at some of our records in the MLC this season.\n\nHighest Total\n\nOur highest total in MLC 2024 came in the Chanpionship against the Unicorns when we scored 207/5 batting first. Incidentally, this is also the highest total in the entire competition this year. Having a huge first innings total helped us cross the line in the title match by 96 runs.\n\nOur 206/5, which we scored in a 42-run win over Texas Super Kings in a league game, is at second place in the overall list.\n\nHighest Individual Score\n\nSkipper Steve Smith’s 52-ball 88 in the Championship against the Unicorns, which powered us to the highest total this season, is the highest individual score for us in MLC 2024. Smith hit six sixes and seven boundaries during his innings to guide us to our first title in MLC.\n\nThis is also the highest individual score for us in the history of MLC as Smith went past Matthew Short’s score of 80 scored against TSK last season.\n\nTop Run-scorer\n\nSteve Smith and Travis Head, with 336 runs from nine matches, were the joint highest run-scorers for us in the MLC 2024 finishing second in the overall batting charts. Smith’s runs came at an impressive average of 56.00 and a strike rate of 148.67 whereas Head averaged 48.00 striking at an astonishing rate of 173.19.\n\nThe pair provided brisk starts at the top of the order and scored 52% of our total runs in MLC this season.\n\nLowest Total against Freedom\n\nMI New York’s 88 in response to our 182/5 is the lowest total by a team against us this season. Jasdeep Singh shone with the ball on his MLC debut picking up 3/14 to restrict MINY as we won the game by 94 runs.\n\nMarco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell also picked up two wickets apiece in an all-round bowling performance. This was also MINY’s lowest total in the MLC.\n\nHighest Wicket-taker\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar finished on top of the overall bowling charts in MLC 2024 with 15 wickets from just seven matches at an average of 13.46 and a strike rate of 10.53. The left-arm pacer’s best bowling effort of 4/35, this season, came against Los Angeles Knight Riders during our eight-wicket win.\n\nNetravalkar was also our top wicket-taker last season with 10 wickets from six matches.\n\nRachin Ravindra is second on the overall list with 12 wickets from six innings at an unbelievable average of 6.08 and a strike rate of 7.58.\n\nBest Bowling in an innings\n\nRavindra’s magical spell of 4/11 in the Qualifier match against the Unicorns is the best bowling figures recorded for us this year. The left-arm spinner’s career-best figures in T20s helped us qualify for the Championship with a seven-wicket win.\n\nIncidentally, Ravindra picked up another four-wicket haul this season, a spell of 4/16, in our league win against TSK by 42 runs.\n\nHighest Partnership\n\nSmith and Head’s 101-run association for the first wicket off just 60 balls in the final league match against the Unicorns is our highest partnership in MLC 2024. The duo hit nine fours and five sixes during their time together at the crease to provide us our first century partnership in MLC.\n\nBut unfortunately, we ended up on the losing side of the content as the Unicorns won by six wickets.\n\nLargest victory margin\n\nThe 96-run win over the Unicorns in the Championship of the MLC 2024 is our biggest victory margin by runs this year.\n\nBatting first, we posted 207/5 on the board with captain Steve Smith top-scoring with a 52-ball 88. In response, the Unicorns could manage only 111 as Ravindra and Jansen picked up three wickets each.\n\nThe eight-wicket win over LAKR during the league phase is our biggest victory in terms of wickets this season. Netravalkar and Maxwell got four and three wickets respectively as Travis Head shone with the bat with a 32-ball 54.\n\nHighest Batting average and strike rate\n\nSteve Smith, averaging 56.00, has the best average, second overall, for us in MLC this season. Out of the nine innings he has batted, Smith has scored 336 runs, including three fifties, and has remained unbeaten on three occasions. He reserved his best for the last as he top-scored in the Final with 88 off 52 balls to help us beat the Unicorns.\n\nMeanwhile, Travis Head has the best strike rate among our batters who have scored a minimum of 100 runs this season. Head amassed 336 runs this season at an excellent strike rate of 173.19. He is also fifth on the overall list of batters with the highest strike rate.\n\nThough Mukhtar Ahmed has a strike rate of 175.00, he faced only 24 balls for his tally of 42 runs in MLC 2024.\n\nMost Fifties\n\nTravis had a purple patch for us this season scoring five fifties, in five consecutive matches. Head leads the overall chart for most fifties in MLC 2024 with five from nine matches. Smith is second on our list with three fifties from the same number of matches.\n\nMost sixes and sixes in an innings\n\nWith 21 sixes from nine matches, Steve Smith is our highest six-hitter, and second overall, this season. Smith and Head, with six sixes each, together share the spoils for the most sixes hit in an innings.\n\nMeanwhile, Head leads the boundary count with a total of 40 fours from nine matches. The southpaw also holds the record for most fours scored in an innings for us with 10 fours in his unbeaten knock of 77 off just 44 balls against the Unicorns in the Qualifier match.\n\nBest Bowling average, economy and strike rate\n\nRachin Ravindra has the best bowling average in MLC 2024 with an average of 6.08 runs for every wicket picked up. The left-arm spinner ended with a total of 12 wickets from seven matches in this campaign conceding only 73 runs.\n\nRavindra also heads the charts for the best economy rates among bowlers in MLC this year. He has sent down a total of 15.1 overs in the tournament at a miserly economy rate of 4.81 runs an over.\n\nAmong bowlers who have sent down a minimum of 10 overs in MLC this year, Ravindra heads the list of best strike rates too with an impressive frequency of 7.58 balls per wicket. His total tally of 12 wickets came in just 91 balls.\n\nAndrew Tye and Jasdeep Singh with 6.00 and 7.00, respectively, have better strike rates but have bowled only five and seven overs each.\n\nMost Catches\n\nMukhtar Ahmed tops our list of most catches by an outfield player with seven catches from nine matches. He is also third on the overall list in MLC 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Mukhtar and Ferguson share the honours for most catches in a single match with three each against TSK and MINY, respectively."
