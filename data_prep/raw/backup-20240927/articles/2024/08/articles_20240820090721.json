        "body": "The University of Texas at Dallas is partnering with the National Cricket League USA in hosting the tournament, which will last 10 days and feature six different teams from around the world.\n\n\"Earlier this year, Texas hosted the first T20 Cricket World Cup in the United States, and our great state has welcomed the Major League Cricket and National Cricket League USA — both of which have a presence and teams in North Texas. As cricket expands its global fan base, Texas will hold front-row seats to its growth across the nation.\"\n\nThe Sixty Strikes event will feature a shortened 60-ball format known for power-hitting and high-scoring matches. The quick, action-packed games typically last around 90 minutes and allow players to be more aggressive while showcasing their skills.\n\nUT Dallas President Richard C. Benson said that many in the “UT Dallas community play or follow the game,” which made the partnership an easy decision for the university.\n\n\"We are excited for the opportunity to host alumni and supporters and to introduce newcomers to our university,” he added.\n\n\"UT Dallas, home of many international students and the Comets Cricket Club, is the perfect site for NCL USA's inaugural season,\" said James B. Milliken, chancellor of The University of Texas System.\n\nNCL USA chairman Arun Agarwal said that it will be a “groundbreaking moment for cricket in the U.S.” as the sport attempts to capture the attention of Americans.\n\n“By merging world-class cricket with premier entertainment, we will captivate a diverse audience and elevate the sport’s presence in North Texas. Sixty Strikes is set to be a game-changer,” Agarwal said."

        "body": "Australia Test captain Pat Cummins will take an eight-week hiatus to recharge as he prepares for the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against India later this year. Fresh off his debut stint in Major League Cricket in the United States, Cummins has opted for rest and recuperation, stepping away from next month's white-ball tour of the United Kingdom.\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\nThis decision is part of a strategic effort to manage his workload and ensure he is physically and mentally prepared for the demanding summer ahead.\n\nCummins believes his absence from the UK tour will enable him to address any physical strains and return to peak condition, aiming to lead Australia effectively in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The series will be particularly critical for the Aussies, as they have conceded successive series defeats to India at home (in 2018/19 and 2020/21).\n\n\"Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it,\" Cummins was quoted as saying by Fox Sports.\n\n\"I've basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago.

After a demoralising start in Adelaide, where India was bowled out for a mere 36 in the day/night Test and suffered a seven-wicket defeat, the tour seemed destined for disaster.\n\nYet, despite the departure of then-captain Virat Kohli for personal reasons and a series of significant injuries that left India fielding a makeshift bowling attack in the final Test, the team defied expectations and clinched a 2-1 series victory.\n\nThe crowning achievement came at the Gabba, a venue long regarded as a fortress for the Australian Test team, unbeaten there since 1989. Pat Cummins, who was part of the Australian squad during India's 2020/21 tour, will look to end India's chances for a hat-trick.\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\n{{^userSubscribed}} {{/userSubscribed}}\n\n\"It's the trophy I haven't won before... this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven't ticked off,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"We've achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\n\"That's what lies ahead of us this summer. They're (India) a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" he added."

        "body": "Major League Cricket: Australia captain Pat Cummins has announced eight weeks complete off from bowling as he prepares his body for another action-packed cricket season, starting with the five-match home Test series against India in November.\n\nThe pacer was not picked for Australia's white-ball tour of the United Kingdom in September as part of workload management which gives him ample time to recover his body from tiring 18 months of cricket.\n\nThe 31-year-old recently returned from the United States following his maiden Major League Cricket campaign with San Francisco United.\n\nTrending\n\nThe last 18 months have been gruelling for Cummins. Following a wrist fracture towards the end of the Ashes series in England, he has played in an ODI series against India, the victorious ODI World Cup in India, three Tests against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour of New Zealand, two Tests against the Black Caps, the Indian Premier League, the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, and the MLC tournament.\n\n“I’m very sore today after a week of gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can’t really nail it while you’re in the midst of the season,” Fox Cricket quoted Cummins as saying.\n\nThe speedster said he will work on rehabilitation exercises during the break and focus on building strength ahead of the tight cricketing season.\n\n“I’ll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can’t really fit in the middle of the season,\" he added.\n\nCummins said the break will allow him to come back fresh and to avoid any injury setback.\n\n“Everyone that comes back after a break and is a little bit fresher, you never regret it. I’ve basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago,\" he said.\n\n“This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer. It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintain pace is a bit easier, make you less susceptible to injuries,\" Cummins added.\n\nThe Border-Gavaskar Trophy, now a five-Test series this summer, has been held by India since 2017. During this period, India has won four consecutive series, including landmark victories on Australian soil in 2018/19 and 2020/21. When Australia last won the trophy, Cummins had just one Test cap.\n\nDespite the Australian men’s team’s significant accomplishments in recent years - including two World Cup titles and a World Test Championship - Cummins recognised that India’s dominance in Test cricket remains “the one blight” that needs to be addressed.\n\n“It’s the trophy I haven’t won before … this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven’t ticked off,” Cummins said.\n\n“We’ve achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\n“That’s what lies ahead of us this summer. They’re a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we’re really well placed also,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Cummins revealed that he has no plans to retire from the game’s shortest format, hoping he can help Australia win gold at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. “Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle,” Cummins said.\n\n“That’s what lies ahead of us this summer. They’re a really good side.

One of them is all-rounder Andre Russell, who has made himself unavailable for this series for West Indies despite recently featuring in the Major League Cricket in the USA and The Hundred in England.\n\nOn Sunday, Cricket West Indies (CWI) announced a 15-man squad for the three-T20I series against the Proteas. Rovman Powell’s side will host Aiden Markram’s team for three games in the shortest format from August 23 to 27.\n\nAll three T20Is will be played at the Brian Lara Stadium, Tarouba, Trinidad.\n\nWhy is Andre Russell not picked for the T20I series against South Africa?\n\nRussell, Jason Holder and Alzarri Joseph will not be part of the WI vs SA series as they have been rested, with Russell particularly requesting the board for rest.\n\nCWI’s director of cricket Miles Bascombe said, “Andre Russell requested a period of rest and recovery as well as Jason Holder who played five back-to-back five Tests against England and South Africa. During this period, they will work closely with the CWI science and medicine team.”\n\nThe 36-year-old has played three T20 tournaments in a row in the past few months: ICC T20 World Cup, MLC and Hundred.\n\nAlzarri Joseph, who was West Indies’ vice-captain at the T20 World Cup, was rested from the test series against South Africa and his resting period has been extended.\n\n“As far as Alzarri is concerned, it always helps to have a period of time away from the game to work on your individual skills, because you could get drawn into moving from one tournament to the next and might actually lose some of your skills,” West Indies’ red-ball coach Andre Coley said.\n\nWest Indies squad for South Africa T20Is:\n\nRovman Powell (C), Roston Chase (VC), Alick Athanaze, Fabian Allen, Johnson Charles, Matthew Forde, Shimron Hetmyer, Shai Hope, Akeal Hosein, Shamar Joseph, Obed McCoy, Gudakesh Motie, Nicholas Pooran, Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd"

        "body": "Australian Test skipper Pat Cummins has decided to take an eight-week break from cricket. The pacer has taken a strategic pause, potentially to boost his performance in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\n\nThe past year has been incredibly demanding for Cummins, with a packed schedule that included the Ashes, ODI World Cup, various Test series, IPL, T20 World Cup, and most recently, the Major League Cricket campaign in the United States. This non-stop cricket schedule has taken its toll, prompting Cricket Australia to manage Cummins' workload carefully.\n\nCummins' decision to step away from cricket for eight weeks is part of a calculated plan to prepare for the highly anticipated five-Test series against India starting in late November. The break will allow him to focus on his strength work and conditioning.\n\n\"I’m very sore today after a week of gym, Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can’t really nail it while you’re in the midst of the season. I’ll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can’t really fit in the middle of the season,\" Cummins told Fox Cricket.\n\nAlso read: CA announces upcoming seven comprehensive years of cricket\n\nI’ve basically been bowling non-stop since the WTC final: Pat Cummins\n\nThe Sydney-born plans to use this time for intensive gym work, running, and rehabilitation exercises.

        "body": "Australia’s Test captain, Pat Cummins, has announced an eight-week break to rejuvenate himself ahead of the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India later this year. This decision comes after a demanding schedule that included his debut in Major League Cricket (MLC) and a busy international calendar.\n\nA Well-Deserved Break\n\nCummins, who recently returned from the United States after participating in the MLC, was rested for the upcoming white-ball tour of the United Kingdom to manage his workload effectively. He expressed his thoughts on taking a break, stating, “Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it.” This time off will allow him to recover physically after nearly 18 months of continuous bowling since the World Test Championship final.\n\n“I’ve basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover,” Cummins explained. He believes that this break will help him maintain his pace and reduce the risk of injuries when he returns to the field.\n\nRecent Challenges\n\nThe past year has been particularly taxing for Cummins, who fractured his wrist during the Ashes series in England. Despite this setback, he has continued to play a crucial role for Australia, participating in various formats, including the IPL 2024, the T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies, the MLC 2024, and multiple Test series.\n\nReflecting on his physical state, Cummins mentioned, “I’m very sore today after a week of gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can’t really nail it while you’re in the midst of the season.” He plans to focus on gym workouts, running, and rehabilitation exercises during his break.\n\nThe Importance of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy\n\nThe upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy will consist of five Test matches, and Cummins is eager to lift the trophy, which has eluded Australia since 2017. India has dominated the series in recent years, winning four consecutive titles, including historic victories on Australian soil in 2018-19 and 2020-21.\n\n“It’s the trophy I haven’t won before… this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven’t ticked off,” Cummins stated. He emphasized the importance of the series, noting, “We’ve achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home.”\n\nFuture Aspirations\n\nLooking beyond the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Cummins is also eyeing the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make its debut. He expressed his desire to compete for Australia in the Olympics, stating, “Watching the Olympics got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle.”\n\nAt 31, Cummins hopes to still be in contention for selection when the time comes. “Honestly right now, it feels a long way away. Maybe once we get closer and start building into it, everyone gets a bit more excited,” he added."
