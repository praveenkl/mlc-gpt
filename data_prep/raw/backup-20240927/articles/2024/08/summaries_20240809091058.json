        "text": "The second season of the MLC, held in July, featured top cricket stars and exciting gameplay, but the bigger challenge is getting a potential audience to notice the tournament. Willow by Cricbuzz, the official North American broadcaster of the MLC, partnered with Regional Sports Networks (RSNs) to broadcast select free MLC matches, even though Willow itself is a subscription-based broadcaster. This strategy aimed to expose cricket to more mainstream sports fans and grow the sport in the US.\n\nThe partnership with RSNs, including Monumental Sports Network, YES Network, ROOT SPORTS, Bally Sports Southwest, Bally Sports SoCal, NBC Sports Bay Area, and NBC Sports California, allowed MLC teams to reach a wider audience and introduce cricket to local sports fans. The broadcasts helped bridge the gap between teams playing on the road and their local fans.\n\nThe RSNs also benefited from the partnership, gaining access to an attractive demographic and valuable content. However, the RSNs needed education on cricket as a broadcasting proposition, and the execution timeline was a lesson learned for improvement in the future. The teams are already looking forward to building on this initiative in 2025."
