        "title": "Major League Cricket Is Luring the World’s Top Stars to the U.S.",
        "date": "Wed Jul 31 12:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Australian bowler Pat Cummins made his debut in Major League Cricket’s second season, which wrapped July 28. The international star, whom Wisden, the English cricketing bible, lists as the leading player in the world, is one of the few athletes with such a broad skill set that he can excel at all three of the sport’s codes: five-day Test matches, one-day games, and the three-hour Twenty20 format played in MLC.\n\nCummins, like many of the game’s best, has his pick of any league, and can set his own schedule; he has recently limited his appearances to international matches for Australia and a roughly $2.4 million annual deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League (IPL)—by far the highest-quality and best-paid T20 league in the world.\n\nIn recent years Cummins has shunned playing in any of the other national T20 competitions that litter the cricket calendar. He has not even competed in the Australian tournament, known as the Big Bash, since 2017. That’s why Cummins’s two-year deal to play for the San Francisco Unicorns was a particular coup for MLC—a relatively small U.S. league with a draw that pales in comparison to overseas leagues, based in a country that still lacks international-standard facilities. His agreement with MLC, inked in June, saw Cummins play in the U.S. before any of MLC’s closest rivals, such as The Hundred in England or SA20 in South Africa.\n\nHe’s just one of the many outstanding overseas cricketers who have landed in the U.S. “We’re ecstatic with the international players we signed up,” says Justin Geale, tournament director of Major League Cricket. “We’ve got some of the best players in the world.”\n\nTalent keeps trickling in from overseas leagues in part because MLC can lay out cash—and other opportunities—in a way some overseas leagues simply can’t. Even as a start-up league in a sport where salaries are relatively low, international stars defecting to the U.S. are finding themselves with paydays that spell earnings they never would have gotten in even some of the world’s biggest leagues.\n\nCricket rosters in the U.S. are increasingly loaded. Cummins (below) joined other outstanding overseas cricketers, including Trinidadian all-rounder Kieron Pollard and South African wicket-keeper batsman Heinrich Klaasen.\n\nThis year, the league has also attracted three key Australians: Steve Smith, a former national team captain; young batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk; and Travis Head, the star of the recent T20 World Cup held in the U.S. and the Caribbean. Add New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra and South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada, and the MLC has jumped ahead of its rivals—The Hundred, in particular—in the race for talent.\n\nIt’s extraordinary that athletes favored the second season of a cricket competition in the U.S. ahead of a tournament held in England, the sport’s historic home. But money talks.\n\nGeale tells Front Office Sports that each of MLC’s six teams has a cap of $1.15 million to hire a squad of between 15 and 18 players. Of this total, $320,000 can be spent on domestic cricketers and $830,000 on up to nine overseas stars. (This is pocket change compared with the wages on offer in the IPL, but noteworthy relative to everywhere else.)\n\nAt the draft for domestic players, first-round picks earned $75,000—but international stars have the potential to earn much more. For example, the Unicorns maxed out their allocation of overseas players in 2024, so if each of the other eight earned the same as the top-earning domestic players, the team would have $230,000 left for Cummins. Exact figures aren’t disclosed, but for the highest-shelf players who will certainly command more than the best domestic players, their earnings for this short stint are highly competitive with—often better than—The Hundred, where the top salary band for domestic and international players is £125,000 (around $160,000).\n\nThese paychecks have left other leagues scrambling. The fourth season of The Hundred, which began July 23, was missing around half of its overseas players because they were involved in MLC. For this year, MLC’s fixture list overlaps with The Hundred by six days. This has forced English franchises to rush to sign players on one-match deals to cover those players still involved in the U.S.\n\n“We’re not here to destroy world cricket,” Geale says. “But for a long time, England has had that summer window to itself by virtue of being in a different hemisphere. If you look at the English winter, you have Australia, South Africa, and India all competing in that space. So, I think some competition [for players] in the summer was inevitable.”\n\nMLC also made an important strategic decision early on that has helped it to draw in overseas players. Before its debut season in 2023, it accepted investment from four of the Indian enterprises that run teams in the IPL. This brought in considerable operational experience, but also demystified MLC for some of the players the league was seeking to attract.\n\n“The players had preexisting relationships with owners, coaches, and support staff, so they could immediately feel comfortable in what is essentially a new tournament,” explains Dan Weston, an English cricket consultant who has worked with franchise teams in The Hundred and the IPL. The New York franchise, which is run by the same operation as the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, includes three overseas players—Tim David of Australia, Dewald Brevis of South Africa, and Romario Shepherd of the West Indies—who play for Mumbai in India.\n\nMLC has been so successful in luring international talent that The Hundred is likely to make changes to catch up.\n\nThe Hundred’s eight teams are currently owned and operated by the England and Wales Cricket Board. This decision means the ECB has complete operational control over the tournament. The ECB also receives all of The Hundred’s revenue. However, this model also puts a ceiling on salaries and prevents the sort of international links that have brought foreign stars to MLC.\n\nThe ECB has secured the approval of the English domestic teams to sell 49% stakes in all Hundred franchises to private investors later this year. Although the ECB has spoken of investing proceeds from the sales into the domestic game and recreational cricket, its major goal is to prevent The Hundred from being outflanked by other competitions, including MLC. An ECB spokesman told FOS, “The global cricketing landscape is highly competitive and that is why we are working to ensure we can attract the best overseas players along with retaining the best English talent.”\n\nThat the ECB is playing catchup to a nascent U.S. league is remarkable. “We certainly have not taken first-mover advantage on private investment,” admitted the ECB’s chief executive, Richard Gould, in a recent interview with The Cricketer. Weston, meanwhile, believes the arrival of private investment would enable the ECB to raise salaries “markedly,” eroding MLC’s current superiority.\n\nYet for all the effort, other leagues may struggle to replicate some of the factors that help MLC draw in overseas stars.\n\n“A lot of the guys see opportunities off the field, as well for their post-cricket careers,” Geale tells FOS. “There is a certain fascination about the American sports market. It is incredibly sophisticated. The brands are big, and they do it really well.”\n\nWhen announcing his deal with the Unicorns, Cummins noted the “long-term” appeal of building links to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Cricket does not yet have the culture of veteran players investing in sports properties, but it is possible that Cummins’s generation could take the first exploratory steps.\n\nAnd even without players without strategic plans, a month in the States is simply an enjoyable time. “Everyone wants to go to the U.S. and see the country,” says Cameron Gannon, an Australian-born bowler who has played in both seasons of MLC. “It’s a huge tourist destination, and the league is a great way to make that happen.”\n\nAs they jostle for the sport’s best players, both MLC and The Hundred have expansion plans. Geale says MLC wants to add another two teams in 2026 and even more beyond that, provided it can build some more grounds to host matches. And across the pond, part of the ECB’s pitch to its potential investors is the opportunity to add more games to its fixture list.\n\nAlthough Geale believes “there is no reason why MLC and The Hundred cannot live nicely together,” future schedule clashes seem likely, necessitating that the leagues will continue to go head-to-head to host the world’s best players.\n\nAs for Cummins, the Unicorns were well beaten in Sunday’s final by Washington Freedom. Nevertheless, the Aussie skipper took the wickets of countrymen Head and Smith and smote two big sixes in a batting cameo of 13 runs off seven balls. A runners-up spot for Cummins and the chance to learn from one of the best players in the game means that both player and team will consider his contract to be money well spent."

        "title": "Major League Cricket 2024 Review: Including talented local cricketers crucial for success in coming years",
        "date": "Wed Jul 31 12:03:33 2024",
        "body": "As Major League Cricket (MLC) completed its second season in July 2024, the league has emerged as an exciting platform for international players while also posing a significant challenge: engaging local youth to ensure cricket’s long-term viability in the United States.\n\nOne of the standout moments this season was Oregon-born Sanjay Krishnamurthi, a 21-year-old computer science student, who hit the winning run for his San Francisco Unicorns, scoring 79 off 42 balls in a thrilling match against Washington Freedom on July 22. This victory not only marked Washington’s first loss of the season but also highlighted the potential for USA-born cricketers to enrich the local sports landscape, laying the groundwork for a vibrant future for cricket in America. Including talented local cricketers in MLC teams will be crucial for the league’s success in the coming years.\n\nHowever, what truly fills the stands at sports venues? It could be the electric atmosphere, the star power of elite athletes, or the intense rivalries that captivate fans. More importantly, fans’ deep emotional bond with their teams keeps them returning. Take the Chicago Cubs in Baseball and their devoted supporters at Wrigley Field or the sold-out crowds cheering for Michael Jordan at the United Center. Currently, Major League Cricket operates with just two venues hosting six teams, which poses a challenge for fans looking to forge a personal connection with their teams. The absence of a home-and-away structure further complicates this relationship, leaving fans yearning for greater engagement and loyalty.\n\nREAD | A second coming for their second home in the T20 World Cup 2024\n\nBuilding that vital fan-team camaraderie remains an uphill battle. With two teams based in California and another in Washington, the lack of dedicated West Coast stadiums hampers local support development. Once the infrastructure is established, proper home-and-away matches can foster deeper connections. However, as the tournament continues to grow over the years, a positive momentum is building. Players are beginning to consider their long-term affiliations, such as Harmeet Singh, the left-arm spinner with roots in the Seattle franchise who has shown his commitment to the team coached by Pravin Amre.\n\nTake, for instance, Pat Cummins, the exceptional Australian bowler who recently signed a four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns, backed by tech entrepreneurs Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan. Cummins strategically aligns his passion for cricket with smart investments for his future, illustrating how players can merge their athletic careers with opportunities that pave the way for long-term success. The United States, often dubbed the land of opportunity, may represent the perfect paradigm for this new venture.\n\nSo far, six teams have participated in MLC’s first two seasons, with four teams from IPL franchises playing integral roles in team management. With the proposed expansion on the horizon, it’s only a matter of time before other IPL teams are interested in the newer MLC expansion teams.\n\nSanjay Parthasarathy, the operating partner and co-owner of the Seattle Orcas, shares his insights with Sportstar on what needs to happen for cricket to thrive in the USA: grassroots development in schools, colleges, and communities; a winning USA national team and appropriate infrastructure. He noted that the USA team’s success in reaching the Super 8 stages of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 has sparked heightened interest and awareness. The Seattle Orcas is actively investing in grassroots initiatives, emphasising, “Building a new location for cricket in the US will take a while. We are moving in the right trajectory with accelerated speed.”\n\nWhen asked about the potential for other IPL teams to join, he remarked, “The first movers in the IPL moved quickly. Based on other T20 leagues, we should expect Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, and Lucknow Super Giants to show interest. All this will depend on the expansion of the MLC, which remains to be seen.”\n\nIn terms of cricket-related excitement, the league has not disappointed. The challenger match between Texas and San Francisco reached a thrilling climax when the Texas Super Kings needed 18 runs off the final over. It faced the formidable Pat Cummins, whose exceptional skill with yorkers proved decisive, ultimately humbling the Super Kings and securing a memorable victory to reach the finals of MLC season 2. While the cricketing entertainment factor has been abundant, the fervent support from loyal fans has been lacking, highlighting a critical area for growth in cultivating dedicated team followings. In the finals of the 2024 MLC, Washington Freedom was led by Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell to provide them with a thumping win over San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nForeign players have also capitalised on the opportunities presented by MLC. Pakistan’s young all-rounder Hassan Khan made the most of his chances this season, citing the benefits of playing in the league."

        "body": "By Chaithanya G\n\nPublished: Thursday, August 1, 2024, 11:45 [IST]\n\nlekhaka-Chaithanya g\n\nNew Zealand international Finn Allen caught the attention of many with his batting exploits in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. The dynamic New Zealand opener set the tournament on fire by playing with intent.\n\nThe 25-year-old who played for San Fransisco Unicorns, finished MLC 2024 as the fourth-highest leading run-getter with 306 runs in nine games at an average of 34, including 1 century and 2 fifties. Moreover, he maintained a sensational strike rate of 187.73, the most by a batter in the tournament. He hasn't played in the Indian Premier League so far. He registered his name at the IPL 2024 auction for his base price of INR 75 lakh.\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to attract the bids at the auction. Nevertheless, he made a real case for himself as an aggressive batter in the recently-concluded MLC 2024 tournament, which strengthened his resume by a notch, making him a most-wanted asset for any T20 team. Let's take a glimpse at the three teams that will go after Finn Allen in the upcoming auction.\n\n1. Sunrisers Hyderabad: The 2016 IPL champions could benefit immensely from Finn Allen’s batting style. The cricket community saw the Sunrisers setting new records in the last season as the players adopted ultra-aggressive batting approach, which helped them record humongous totals. The IPL 2024 runners-up might show a great deal of interest to sign the New Zealander since he possesses all the qualities to accelerate the scoring rate.\n\n2. Chennai Super Kings: The five-time IPL champions purchased Rachin Ravindra for INR 1.8 crore at the previous auction. Unfortunately, the signing turned out to be an utter flop as he hardly upped his game as an opener. CSK who failed to qualify for the playoffs last season might offload Rachin Ravindra in an attempt to rope in fellow New Zealander Fin Allen as a long term investment. CSK might benefit from Allen's explosive stroke play in the powerplay overs.\n\n3. Gujarat Titans: The Ahmedabad-based franchise won the trophy in their debut season in IPL 2022. In the subsequent season, they failed to defend the title before surrendering at the hands of Chennai Super Kings in the final. However, they failed to qualify for the playoffs in IPL 2024 by finishing eighth on the points table. After a forgettable campaign, GT might try to sign quality players at the auction. If they manage to sign Finn Allen, he would bolster their lineup and enhance the team's chances of dominating the league.\n\nGet breaking news alerts.\n\nAllow Notifications\n\nOther articles published on Aug 1, 2024"
