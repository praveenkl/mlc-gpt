        "body": "Australian batter Steve Smith is looking forward to making a return to the Indian Premier League (IPL) after not getting a chance to play in the tournament in the last three seasons. The 35-year-old, who had a splendid season with the bat in the Major League Cricket (MLC), talked about putting his name in the mix in the upcoming IPL 2025 auction.\n\nNotably, Steve Smith was the key player at the top of the order for the Washington Freedom, who went onto defeat the San Francisco Unicorns in a one-sided final, to win the MLC title. He was the joint second-highest run-scorer in the tournament alongside his opening partner Travis Head, putting together 336 runs at an average of 56 and a strike-rate of 148.67.\n\nWhile speaking in an exclusive interview to Fox Cricket, Steve Smith looked forward to playing in the IPL in the upcoming season after making his last appearance in the tournament in 2021 for Delhi Capitals, going unsold in two subsequent auctions. He said, “I'd certainly love another opportunity at the IPL. I'll be throwing my name in the ring, and we'll see how we go.”\n\nI've played quite nicely: Steve Smith on his recent T20 performances\n\n“I feel like in every opportunity I've had in T20 cricket recently and franchise stuff, I've played quite nicely. So hopefully I just keep putting my name up there and enjoying it,” he added.\n\nSteve Smith also shared his excitement on being a part of the Sydney Sixers, looking forward to turning up for them in the Australian summer despite a busy Test schedule with the national team. The New South Welshman remarked, “I haven't even looked at the schedule, to be honest. But I've enjoyed playing for the Sixers whenever I've had the opportunity. It's a really great franchise with great people, and they've had a lot of success. We'll see how we go. I'd love to play a few games.”"

        "body": "Pat Cummins, the captain of Australia’s Test cricket team, is planning a short return to the Sheffield Shield to prepare for the upcoming Test series against India, which is set to commence in late November. Cummins, who has just finished a stint in Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States, has been given a break from Australia’s white-ball tour of Scotland and England scheduled for next month. This time off will allow him to concentrate on his strength and conditioning, ensuring he is in peak form for the home summer season. The Sheffield Shield matches will serve as a critical part of Cummins' preparation, offering him an opportunity to fine-tune his skills and regain match fitness before facing India. The Test series against the Indian team will be a demanding one, consisting of five matches spread over slightly more than seven weeks. Following this intense series, Cummins and the Australian team will then travel to Sri Lanka for two additional Test matches, making for a busy and challenging schedule.\n\nOverall, Cummins' strategy reflects a thoughtful approach to balancing rest and preparation. By focusing on conditioning and competitive play in the Sheffield Shield, he aims to be fully prepared for the rigors of the Test series against India and the subsequent tour of Sri Lanka. His proactive approach underscores the importance of meticulous planning and physical readiness in maintaining peak performance throughout a busy international cricket calendar.\n\nThe upcoming seven Test matches against India and Sri Lanka are crucial for Australia as they determine the team’s chances of defending their World Test Championship title at Lord’s next June. Currently, Australia is positioned second in the World Test Championship standings, trailing behind India. These matches will be pivotal in Australia’s quest to secure a spot in the final and retain their championship status.\n\nPat Cummins, who last participated in the Sheffield Shield for New South Wales in February 2021, has played in only nine Shield matches throughout his career. His brief return to the domestic competition will be a vital part of his preparation for the upcoming Tests. Cummins' involvement in the Shield will help him regain match fitness and sharpen his skills ahead of the high-stakes series against India.\n\nIn addition to the Sheffield Shield, there is an ODI series against Pakistan scheduled for early November. This series could also play a role in Cummins' preparation, providing him with valuable match practice and helping him build form and rhythm before the Test series begins. Overall, Cummins’ strategic focus on domestic cricket and potential ODI involvement reflects his commitment to ensuring peak performance in the critical Test series. The outcomes of these seven Tests will be significant, as they will determine Australia’s ability to defend their World Test Championship title and influence their preparations for the final at Lord’s.\n\n\"Ronnie [coach Andrew McDonald] called me the other day and said we need to talk about this.I prefer to go a little bit fresher but definitely play some cricket going in. So I'd say it's either two or three ODIs, plus a Shield [game] or maybe just some Shield, maybe some NSW one-day stuff. I imagine kind of late October/early November will be when I start playing building up for the Tests,\" said Australian captain Pat Cummins during a recent interview."
