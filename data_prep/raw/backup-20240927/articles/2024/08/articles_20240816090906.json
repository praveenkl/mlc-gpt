        "body": "New Delhi, Aug 8 (SocialNews.XYZ) The participation of Bangladesh’s premier left-arm spin bowling all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan in the upcoming two-match Test series against Pakistan, starting on August 21 in Rawalpindi, is still uncertain.\n\nA report in The Daily Star newspaper says Shakib, who is currently playing in the Global T20 Canada league after playing in Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA last month, was given NOC by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) till August 12, following which he was expected to join the national side either in Bangladesh or Pakistan directly.\n\nBut with the current unrest in Bangladesh, which resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her fleeing the country, Shakib is unlikely to come back anytime soon. Moreover, Shakib was an elected MP via the Awami League party but is not a lawmaker anymore due to the Bangladesh Parliament being dissolved.\n\nThe report, though, says Shakib’s fitness for playing red-ball cricket is a concern for the selectors as he has been playing T20 matches since May. \"Before it was just about whether he (Shakib) could come to Bangladesh and then travel to Pakistan.”\n\n“He's been playing cricket but, in a format, where he has to score quickly in a short time. And even though he knows how to play longer matches, there's a concern about whether he can handle the physical demands (of Test cricket),\" a BCB official was quoted as saying in the report.\n\nIt added that the selectors are likely to talk to skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in one or two days to finalise the 15-member squad for the Test series against Pakistan.\n\nShahriar Nafees, in charge of Cricket Operations with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), was quoted as saying in the report that Shakib's inclusion in the Test team is dependent on both his availability and selection.\n\n\"He is only a cricketer now. There is a question of whether he is available for the series now and another is whether he gets picked for the tour. We will run our activity keeping these two factors in mind,\" he concluded.\n\nSource: IANS"

        "body": "Chris Green has been summoned as cover for Rashid Khan for the last couple of matches that the Rockets are scheduled to play. The Australian all-rounder was previously a part of the Rockets for the first couple of matches when players were yet to arrive from the closing stages of Major League Cricket.\n\nRashid injured himself while trying to save a boundary in the field in their recent clash against Southern Braves. He was also in the news for the wrong reasons after Pollard thrashed him for five back-to-back sixes, a record etched in the annals of the Hundred.\n\nWhile the severity of the injury is uncertain, the Rockets would be hoping for Imad Wasim’s quick recovery to bolster the side along with injury replacement Green.\n\nCurrently, the Rockets are positioned fifth in the points table with six points from as many matches. They will face the Birmingham Phoenix and the Oval Invincibles in their next couple of assignments."

        "body": "In this article, we will discuss the Top 5 All-Rounders You Can’t-Miss in MLC 2024. As Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 approaches, the anticipation is building for an action-packed season featuring some of the best cricketing talents from around the world. Among these players, all-rounders are crucial as they provide balance and versatility to their teams. Here, we spotlight five all-rounders you can’t miss in MLC 2024.\n\nSunil Narine\n\nSunil Narine has been exceptional, particularly in the 2024 IPL where he was the highest-impact player of the tournament. With 488 runs at a strike rate of 180.7 and 17 wickets at an economy rate of 6.7, he was second-best only to Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nNarine’s versatility is invaluable, especially on the slightly sluggish pitches expected in America. He might be utilized as an opening batter, a role where he has found significant success for the Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nRead More: Which Top 5 Batters Will Dominate MLC 2024?\n\nAndre Russell\n\nAndre Russell, the dynamic West Indian all-rounder, was the standout performer for the Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) last season. Despite the team’s overall struggles, Russell’s batting brilliance shone through with a strike rate close to 160 and an excellent average of 68, including two fifties.\n\nIn 2024, Russell has continued his form, boasting a batting average of around 43 and a phenomenal strike rate of 203.2 in 28 innings. Fresh off a title-winning campaign with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, Russell’s explosive hitting and useful bowling will be key for LAKR’s success in MLC.\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nWith a reputation for explosive batting, Glenn Maxwell entered IPL 2024 on fire, having accumulated 552 runs in 17 T20s since November 2023, with an average of 42.46 and a strike rate of 185.85, including two hundred. However, his IPL 2024 performance was underwhelming, scoring only 52 runs in 10 matches at an average of 5.78.\n\nDespite this, Maxwell remains a key figure for Washington Freedom in MLC 2024. His ability to change the game with both bat and ball makes him a critical component of the team.\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nRachin Ravindra’s meteoric rise in international cricket has been nothing short of spectacular. After a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup, Ravindra was snapped up by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for INR 1.8 crore in the IPL. His explosive debut, where he opened the innings due to Devon Conway’s injury, saw him scoring a quickfire 37 off 15 balls against the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and a 20-ball 46 against the Gujarat Titans.\n\nNow, Ravindra is expected to open for Washington Freedom in MLC 2024. With pitch conditions in the USA likely to assist his bowling, Ravindra’s performances will not only be critical for his team.\n\nMitchell Santner\n\nMitchell Santner, one of the most promising all-rounders in the world, has been a potent force for New Zealand in limited-overs cricket. With his vast experience playing across different conditions globally, Santner brings a wealth of knowledge and skill to the Texas Super Kings (TSK).\n\nWith dual strengths in batting and bowling, Santner is an essential team member. He has accumulated 199 wickets in 196 matches while scoring 2213 runs, showcasing his capability to impact the game in multiple facets. On the batting-friendly pitches of Texas."
