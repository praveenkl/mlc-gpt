However, former Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar, who was part of the broadcast team, expressed disappointment over the decline in the MLC's overall quality and attendance compared to its inaugural season. Gavaskar suggested that the tournament's standards were affected by the presence of \"ordinary players\" and international stars who seemed \"a little casual\" in their performances. He proposed a major overhaul, including restricting players to participating in only three T20 leagues worldwide, in order to maintain high standards and competitiveness."
