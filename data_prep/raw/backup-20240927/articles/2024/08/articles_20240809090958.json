        "date": "",
        "body": "Cricket fans witnessed yet another nail-biter as the San Francisco Unicorns edged out MI New York by just three runs at the Major League Cricket tournament on July 19. The game's excitement was palpable, and it showcased the thrilling nature of T20 cricket and what can happen when two competitive teams clash on the field.\n\nThe Unicorns initially batted first, struggling to build momentum as they stumbled at 148 runs, losing seven wickets over their 20 overs. This opening innings was marked by uncertainty, with several critical wickets falling at key moments. After establishing the foundation with their top order missing, the middle and lower orders had to scramble to salvage as many runs as possible.\n\nCorey Anderson stood out as the leading scorer for the Unicorns, contributing 47 runs from 32 balls. Anderson's innings included five fours and two sixes, which proved instrumental in keeping the score respectable. He, along with Pat Cummins, who smashed 28 runs off just 14 balls, gave the Unicorns the late push they desperately needed. Cummins' aggressive batting and windfall of runs helped breathe life back for the Unicorns as they looked to defend their score against MI New York.\n\nMI New York, armed with their own star players, walked onto the field confidently. Chasing 149 runs, they had the heavy hitters necessary for such tall orders. They quickly got to work, but the hopes of their fans were soon dealt severe blows. Early wickets fell to the Unicorns' impressive bowling lineup, leaving MI New York struggling at 41 runs with only three wickets to show at one point.\n\nDespite the shaky start, MI New York showed resilience and made brief comebacks at various stages, particularly through Heath Richards, who rallied to score 28 runs and included some thrilling moments as he smacked sixes and fours throughout his innings. Each run seemed to fuel the growing anticipation among the fans, but the mounting pressure and tight bowling soon began to take its toll.\n\nThe climax of the game unfolded under the dazzling lights, with MI New York's score teetering on the edge of victory. With just ten runs needed from the final over, the excitement turned electric. But the Unicorns' bowlers held their nerve. The last over encapsulated the drama of T20 cricket, as MI New York went from hopefuls to the brink of defeat. Last-minute wickets fell, and it all came down to one final delivery, needing just one run to tie. Alas, MI New York ended their innings at 145 runs, falling just short of taking the win.\n\nUnicorns' Rashid Khan played a critical role as their star bowler, snaring 4 wickets for just 32 runs across his four overs. His wicket-taking ability proved utterly destructive, particularly during the middle overs, which helped prevent MI New York from ever fully stabilizing their chase. Alongside Rashid, Romario Shepherd also shone with the ball, securing 2 wickets and maintaining pressure on the MI New York batters.\n\nThe crowd was entertained, and the match illustrated the entertainment and unpredictability of T20 cricket. Each ball delivered, each swing of the bat, and every catch taken contributed not just to the game but to the excitement radiated from the stadium. Fans knew they were part of something special, filled with adrenaline and suspense.\n\nDespite the heartbreak of narrowly losing, MI New York’s performance could not be dismissed. Their fight so deeply embedded the spirit of the game, and fans took heart knowing their team could have easily turned the tables with just one more good run. For the Unicorns, it's all about how they maintained focus and demonstrated key elements of composure, skill, and strategy at the critical moments.\n\nWhile both teams displayed moments of brilliance, the day undoubtedly belonged to the San Francisco Unicorns. Their victory serves as another reminder of the charm and unpredictability of cricket, especially within the thrilling structure of T20. The excitement is only meant to build up as the tournament progresses.\n\nLooking ahead, fans are eager to see how both teams will adjust and learn from their respective performances. Each match is not just about the scores but developing strategies and building momentum through the series. With every game, teams will aim to solidify their places and potentially head for the playoff rounds."

        "body": "Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials are still uncertain about including premier all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan in their upcoming two-Test series against Pakistan. Shakib, who is currently participating in the Global T20 Canada, had previously shown interest in playing the Test series, which is set to begin on August 21 in Rawalpindi. He had planned to return to Bangladesh from the USA, where he had been playing in the Major League Cricket, following his NOC from the BCB until August 12.\n\nHowever, Shakib's situation has changed after he lost his parliamentary seat on August 6 due to the recent political unrest, which may delay his return to Bangladesh. This uncertainty could potentially affect his selection for the national team. Furthermore, there are concerns about Shakib's readiness for Test cricket, given his recent continuous T20 matches since the home series against Zimbabwe in May.\n\nAccording to a report by The Daily Star, a BCB official mentioned that the initial concern was whether Shakib could travel to Bangladesh and then Pakistan, but now there are worries about his ability to handle the physical demands of Test cricket after playing T20s. The selectors have struggled to reach Shakib over the past week due to the unrest and are expected to consult with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in the coming days before finalizing the squad.\n\nThe report further added that an 18-member preliminary squad has already been prepared, including Shakib and pacer Taskin Ahmed, but the final 15-member squad will be determined after discussions with the selection panel. Meanwhile, Cricket Operations In-charge Shahriar Nafees has stated that Shakib's inclusion will depend on both his availability and his selection for the series.\n\nAll-rounder withdraws from BD 'A' team's tour of Pak\n\nSaifuddin, who was selected for the second four-day match of a two-match series and the subsequent three-match one-day series against Pakistan 'A', communicated his need for a break via email\n\nAll-rounder Mohammad Saifuddin has withdrawn from the upcoming Bangladesh 'A' team's tour of Pakistan, citing mental exhaustion and requesting a two-month break from all cricketing activities.\n\nSaifuddin, who was selected for the second four-day match of a two-match series and the subsequent three-match one-day series against Pakistan 'A', communicated his need for a break via email to the selectors earlier this month, according to a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official.\n\nIn his email, Saifuddin expressed his disappointment over not being selected for the ICC T20 World Cup squad in June and his inability to travel to Canada for the ongoing Global T20 due to unrest in the country.\n\n\"Due to these matters, I want to keep myself away from all forms of cricket for the next two months. Hopefully, you will take the matter in a positive way,\" Saifuddin's email read.\n\nHowever, Saifuddin did not mention the right rib injury he sustained during a gym session in Mirpur two days before his scheduled flight to Canada in late July. He was set to represent the Montreal Tigers in the GT20, having obtained a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the BCB until August 8. Afterward, he was expected to join the 'A' team in Pakistan.\n\nBCB physio Muzadded Sany explained that Saifuddin noticed the injury after the gym session and consulted the BCB medical team when the pain persisted. BCB chief physician Dr. Debashish Chowdhury assessed his condition and provided treatment instructions, noting the severity of the pain. Concerns about the impact of a 22-hour economy-class flight on his injury led the BCB to advise against his travel to Canada.\n\nAccording to the report in The Daily Star, Saifuddin's recent letter has frustrated the selectors, as he had missed most of the Bangladesh Tigers' practice sessions in Sylhet and Chattogram last month.\n\nAn anonymous official noted that Saifuddin only participated in nine days of practice in Sylhet and four days in Chattogram out of a 45-day camp. He left the Chattogram camp early, citing the need to attend a biometric appointment for his Canada visa.\n\nPreviously, he had taken leave for family issues before Eid, and subsequently requested an extension, which was granted due to the family emergency. The official concluded by expressing concern over Saifuddin's current reluctance towards cricket."

He's been playing cricket but, in a format, where he has to score quickly in a short time. And even though he knows how to play longer matches, there's a concern about whether he can handle the physical demands (of Test cricket),\" a BCB official was quoted as saying in the report.\n\nIt added that the selectors are likely to talk to skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in one or two days to finalise the 15-member squad for the Test series against Pakistan.\n\nShahriar Nafees, in charge of Cricket Operations with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), was quoted as saying in the report that Shakib's inclusion in the Test team is dependent on both his availability and selection.\n\n\"He is only a cricketer now. There is a question of whether he is available for the series now and another is whether he gets picked for the tour. We will run our activity keeping these two factors in mind,\" he concluded."

Each match is crucial, influencing team standings on the points table. Recent fixtures, especially involving the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings, have offered valuable insights into team form and strategies.\n\nMatch Recap\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders fell to the Seattle Orcas in Dallas, where the Orcas won by 9 wickets.

Texas Super Kings\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have made a strong statement in the early stages of MLC 2024, securing victories in three out of their four matches.

        "date": "Wed Aug  7 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Growing a professional sport in the US is a massive undertaking: a multi-decade, multi-front effort.\n\nAmong many other tactics, it requires exposing the sport to potential new fans, and having a product compelling enough to convert them into regular ones.\n\nSeason 2 of Cognizant Major League Cricket (MLC), held this past July, provided such a product. It featured dozens of the world’s top stars – a collection of franchise talent many say is second only to the IPL – and an exciting level of play.\n\nBut having a great tournament is actually the easier half of the battle.\n\nThe bigger challenge is getting a potential audience – existing cricket fans and, more importantly, non-cricket fans – to notice what is going on to begin with.\n\nJust getting to that starting point requires first winning an all-out war for consumer attention: against every other entrenched major professional sport and every form of passive video entertainment – from YouTube to social media platforms to streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon.\n\nWith the dust now settling on MLC Season 2, it is becoming clear that the awareness initiative with arguably the highest impact this time around, and with even stronger potential for future seasons, was Willow by Cricbuzz’s local broadcast partnership strategy, spearheaded by COO Todd Myers.\n\nSpecifically, Willow partnered with Regional Sports Networks (RSNs) for each of the MLC teams to broadcast select free MLC matches, even though Willow itself is a subscription-based broadcaster.\n\nWillow and the MLC\n\nWillow by Cricbuzz (“Willow TV” or “Willow”), owned by Times Internet, is a pillar of US cricket. It is the official North American broadcaster for the ICC, virtually all major franchise tournaments, and many national boards. So it has a keen interest in growing cricket in the US.\n\nMoreover, Willow was not only the official North American broadcaster of Major League Cricket’s Season 2, it was also a major sponsor – one of the two Official Partners.\n\nIt was through that lens that Willow’s COO Myers – who previously spent over 16 years as a producer programming director with ESPN – approached the challenge of expanding the MLC’s broadcast audience.\n\n“Look,” says Myers, “we want to grow cricket in the US. And one path to do that is to expose cricket to more mainstream sports fans that are watching other sports.”\n\nSo Myers conceived of an ambitious plan only a few months before the tournament to partner with RSNs, namely:\n\nMonumental Sports Network (DC Freedom)\n\nYES Network (MI New York)\n\nROOT SPORTS (Seattle Orcas)\n\nBally Sports Southwest (Texas Super Kings)\n\nBally Sports SoCal (LA Knight Riders)\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nNBC Sports California (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\n“These RSNs combined reach a way larger potential audience than Willow. And it’s that exposure piece for the league, for the individual teams and then for the sport of cricket to grow as well.”\n\nConverting local sports fans to cricket fans, one at a time\n\nBeyond the simple exposure math, Myers emphasized the importance of RSNs to introducing existing local sports fans to a new local sports team.\n\n“So we have a deal with Root Sports Northwest. You like Seattle sports? Great. We’ve got another professional team for you to root for, the Seattle Orcas. And oh, by the way, if you’re watching the Mariners game, you can watch the cricket. There’s no additional subscription fee that you have to pay, or subscribe to another tier on television. It’s all Root Sports Northwest. ”\n\nSeattle Orcas CEO Hemant Dua noted how the value was not just in broadcasting into new homes, but also bringing cricket into public spaces, especially sports bars, and introducing the sport beyond the traditional South Asian audience.\n\n“Sports pubs are visited by the local populations and the percentage of South Asians is probably 5% of the foot traffic footfalls, right? And if you look at what’s up on the screen it’s all the time? Root Sports. So even a few matches shown this year, at the pubs thousands will see cricket. That to me if, even out of that a small percentage convert, that’s a huge win.”\n\nThe Orcas took it a step further and planned local activations around games, complete with games and fan activities, at major sports bars such as Seattle’s Flat Stick pub:\n\nMulti-platform collaboration\n\nThe partnerships between teams and RSNs also extended beyond broadcast and into social media.\n\nFor example, the YES Network (owned by the New York Yankees) did extensive social posts with the MI New York team.\n\nThis worked as expected: networks like YES were thrilled to collaborate with players with social media profiles of the magnitude of Rashid Khan.\n\nAccording to Jared Boshnack, the YES Network VP of Production, “The entire MI New York organization and their partners were incredible to work with and we used assets to collaborate and execute promotions across all of our platforms.”\n\nThis was also an effective channel to introduce cricket to new American fans, as seen in priceless comments such as: “Can any of these guys play 2nd base?”\n\nThe YES Network also included cricket in its other programming, including a “Cricket 101” segment on Jimmy ‘Jomboy’ O’Brien’s popular studio show.\n\nPlaying away from home\n\nAnother important function played by these broadcast partnerships was helping solidify the connection between local fans and teams that were not playing in their hometowns.\n\nWith the exception of the Texas Super Kings, none of the MLC teams have a home stadium, and these other five teams played all their games on the road in Grand Prairie, TX or Morrisville, NC\n\nIn that context, these broadcasts are critical to bridging the gap between now and a future where MLC teams all play home games. David White, GM of the San Francisco Unicorns, explains:\n\n“To take Major League Cricket to its full potential, it’s critical that we have the broadcast partners to take what is a first class sporting product to the widest audiences. We want to give Unicorns fans the chance to watch their heroes while they’re on the road.\n\n“This partnership with NBC Sports is the ideal platform to showcase what the Unicorns are all about to a sports mad Bay Area, and will lay the foundations for future support as we look to build a local fan base capable of filling out our future stadium game in, game out.”\n\nA two-way street\n\nFor as much value as the MLC teams and the league are getting out of the RSN partnerships, the RSNs are getting tremendous benefits as well.\n\nFor starters, cricket brings with it a very attractive demographic. Just as teams are eager to reach local fans of same-city sports teams, Regional Sports Networks are keen to expand their network to new local audiences, especially the professional-heavy South Asian demographic, which is present in large numbers in all the MLC markets.\n\nCaitlin Mangum, Vice President, Content & Programming at Monumental Sports Network agreed with this: “Cricket is undergoing a surge of popularity in the U.S. and we’re excited for a new audience to get exposure to the plethora of live, local sports programming on our air.”\n\nThe other valuable asset that the RSNs are obtaining in these partnerships is the content itself. And this comes at an interesting and challenging time for RSNs, who are facing a major challenge from streaming and OTT models.\n\nThe Yes Network, owned by the Yankees, is an exception to these content challenges. But the remainder of the RSNs in question have to license sports content from teams, and are also losing subscribers, leading to well documented challenges to their business models.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the content provided by cricket is a very welcome, and attractive, asset.\n\nEducating RSNs\n\nAccording to Willow’s Myers, when he first reached out to the RSNs about the possibility, they were extremely positive:\n\n“Each of the RSNs was truly very enthusiastic about it. We didn’t have any negativity from the other side of like – oh that’s cricket, we don’t care. No one said viewers won’t care. It was the exact opposite: ‘This is cool. We love to try to be part of this and help grow MLC and grow cricket.’”\n\nAt the same time, they needed to be educated, especially on cricket as a broadcasting proposition.\n\nMyers continued: “I had to educate them, which is probably no surprise, on just what the sport of cricket is. Not that they didn’t know the sport existed, but: here’s how a game works, how to use vernacular, how a match plays out – ex. after every over there’s a 30 second commercial, explaining to them that when there’s a strategic time out or when a wicket falls that creates a commercial break. So kind of explaining them to the game. But all of them were very enthusiastic.”\n\nLessons for the future: an earlier start in 2025\n\nIf there was one glaring area for improvement in the future for this initiative, it is in the execution timeline.\n\nMyers reflects on lessons learned: “What would I change? I would engage with our RSN partners a lot earlier. Because literally we were completing deals right up until almost when the first ball was bowled. And that was because we reached out really late to try to make this happen. It takes time to get contracts done.”\n\nAs a result, the opportunity was not maximized. RSN schedules are programmed in advance, and not everything could fall neatly into place this time.\n\nLead time would also help with respect to planning marketing activations like the Orcas pursued.\n\nMyers continued: “Instead of engaging with these partners in mid-May, it should be early April. But the second time around should be easier. They will have (already) done it. We won’t have to go through the education process again, it should be more streamlined.”\n\nAll that said, the teams are already getting excited for 2025.\n\n“I think Todd’s done a great job on this,” said the Orcas’ Dua, summing up the sentiment in the league about Willow’s initiative. “So more power to him and we’re very excited and we want to build this and showcase all our games next year.”"

        "body": "Officials from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) are still not sure if they will include top all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan in their next two-Test series against Pakistan. Shakib is currently playing in the Global T20 Canada tournament and had earlier expressed interest in joining the Test series, which starts on August 21 in Rawalpindi. He had intended to come back to Bangladesh from the USA, where he was playing in the Major League Cricket, after his permission from the BCB ended on August 12.\n\nBut things have changed for Shakib since he lost his position in parliament on August 6 because of recent political problems, which might make him come back to Bangladesh later. This change could possibly affect whether he gets picked for the national team. Also, there are worries about whether Shakib is ready for Test cricket, considering he has been playing continuous T20 matches since the series against Zimbabwe in May.\n\nA BCB official said in a report that they were first worried if Shakib could go to Bangladesh and then Pakistan, but now they are concerned about if he can handle the physical challenges of Test cricket after playing T20 games. The selectors have had trouble contacting Shakib in the last week because of the unrest, and they plan to talk to captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in the next few days before picking the final team.\n\nThe report also mentioned that an 18-player preliminary team has been made, including Shakib and fast bowler Taskin Ahmed, but the final 15-player team will be chosen after talking with the selection panel. Cricket Operations In-charge Shahriar Nafees said that whether Shakib is included in the team will depend on if he is available and if he is chosen for the series."
