        "title": "San Francisco Unicorns Embracing Silicon Valley Identity As Major League Cricket Takes Off",
        "date": "Thu May 23 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Co-owned by Silicon Valley venture capitalists, San Francisco Unicorns have decided to embrace a specific identity as the franchise builds a brand in the fledgling Major League Cricket.\n\n\"The way we assembled the franchise...we want to be the Silicon Valley team. Silicon Valley is where start-ups are key,\" Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman told me in a phone interview. \"We want to identify young players who become icons. Our focus has been on finding superstars for the future.\n\n\"We wanted to use data and AI to inform and evaluate the sport.\"\n\nAnd which budding star did the cutting edge technology spit out? Jake Fraser-McGurk, the 22-year-old batting dynamo whose devastating power-hitting has lit up the ongoing Indian Premier League to such a degree that Australia's hierarchy were compelled to add him to their T20 World Cup squad as a reserve.\n\nThe Unicorns, who finished second from the bottom last year, quickly pounced and signed Fraser-McGurk for the upcoming season starting on July 5 in a somewhat reconnection with his former state Victoria, who have a high-performance partnership with the Unicorns.\n\n\"We've seen in the IPL that T20 is moving towards power striking and we're seeing huge totals scored, so we've gone for young players who can do that,\" Rajaraman said.\n\n\"We are trying something different with that start-up mindset. We've built a young list. We're hoping to start building tight affiliations with players, so fans can start seeing those connections.\"\n\nRajaraman and co-owner Venky Harinarayan understand the challenges that lie ahead for the Unicorns, with the novelty factor wearing off from the successful debut of MLC as cricket attempts to genuinely infiltrate the world's biggest sports market.\n\nAfter building the blocks in 2019, with investment topping $100 million, the well-heeled MLC's scheduled launch in 2021 then 2022 was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But its debut last season was nonetheless rushed leaving franchises scrambling to fill rosters.\n\n\"The decision to play the season was made just two months before the season. We didn't really have time to assemble a team,\" Harinarayan said. \"We just tried to put everything together and it was sort of a trial. It was a case of getting some players and see if this thing works.\n\n\"Even for a lot of the players it wasn't clear that this league was here to stay. The first season exceeded our expectations, but we start the second season with a little bit of nervousness because we have to sustain the momentum and then grow it.\"\n\nThe six-team MLC will expand by six games this season with teams to play seven matches in the group stages ahead of the four playoff games concluding with the final on July 28. As I reported recently, salary caps will not increase, but player wages will remain in the top echelons of T20 professional leagues.\n\nThere is an eventual goal that a home-and-away season - where teams play each other twice - will underpin MLC, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds with significant infrastructure required.\n\nLike last year the entire tournament will once again be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina. For the Unicorns, a stadium in San Jose in the works but still likely several years away.\n\n\"We are hampered until we actually play games at home. It's going to be a challenge for us to actually build real connectivity in the community,\" Harinarayan said. \"We want to first nail the South Asian community. The number two country in terms of new citizens in the U.S. was India after Mexico.\n\n\"At the same time we are very conscious that we want to make this experience, especially in the stadiums, really friendly to folks who are not South Asian.\n\n\"We saw last season that a fair number of locals, who weren't cricket fans, just showed up because it was on and they were surprised how much they enjoyed it.\"\n\nMLC starts less than a week after the T20 World Cup, which is partly hosted by the U.S. with group games in New York, Dallas and Lauderhill, Florida.\n\nWhile the build-up of the T20 World Cup has been completely overshadowed by the pointy end of the money-spinning IPL, there has been considerable attention on cricket's investment into the U.S.\n\nThe newly constructed ground in Long Island - costing around $30 million, as I reported recently - has grabbed much of the headlines and so too the exorbitant prices for resale tickets for the tournament's marquee game between rivals India and Pakistan in New York.\n\n\"Folks have commented how crazy the (India-Pakistan) prices are... they are even mind blowing for a Super Bowl,\" Rajaraman said. \"There's a lot of energy and excitement about that game and particularly India playing in the U.S.\n\n\"It's obviously phenomenal for cricket in America. Hopefully MLC gets a tailwind from it.\"\n\nThe Unicorns are the latest partnership between Rajaraman and Harinarayan. They were founding partners of early ecommerce company Junglee, which was acquired by Amazon Amazon in 1998 for $250 million. They also later founded Kosmix, which was acquired by Walmart Walmart , and were early investors in Facebook.\n\nThey've had an early win in their foray into sports with the Unicorns' distinctive name proving catchy among its fanbase after initial skepticism. \"You can either pick a safe name and just create an empty vessel or basically pick something which maybe not everybody likes,\" Harinarayan said.\n\n\"It got people riled up, but people really love it. There were fans wearing caps and attire and making their own interpretation of the name. The feedback has been extraordinarily positive.\"\n\nOwning a cricket team, the sport they are so passionate about, still feels slightly surreal for the India-born entrepreneurs.\n\n\"There's a bit of drudgery to be honest, but we really enjoy the cricket aspects,\" Rajaraman said. \"We want to get better as a franchise while also playing our part in making the league and U.S. cricket stronger.\n\n\"Just like from the start-up mindset, it sometimes takes a couple of iterations to get things right.\""

The US had a taste of franchise cricket in 2023, with the resoundingly successful inaugural season of Major League Cricket, but international cricket history in North America goes back a long, long time. So far back, in fact, that the first ever international cricket match on record was played here, at the St George's Cricket Club ground in New York, between United States and Canada in 1844 (and Canada won).\n\nIn 1859, the US also hosted the first international cricket tour when an England XI travelled to the country - three years before the first England tour of Australia - to play five matches and three exhibition games against local cricketers, one of whom was later baseball pioneer Harry Wright.\n\nAn illustration of a match in progress in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851, between the New England and St George's cricket clubs © Corbis via Getty Images\n\nCricket's popularity dwindled after the American Civil War, as baseball's began to grow, but clubs across US and Canada continued to play each other intermittently well into the 20th century.\n\nMembers of the Winnipeg Junior Cricket Club play a game in Lincoln Park in Chicago in 1935 © Getty Images\n\nPhiladelphia and Pennsylvania remained thriving hubs of cricket in America where matches still drew sizeable crowds.\n\nImpeccably turned out spectators at a game at Merion Cricket Club in Haverford, Pennsylvania in 1938 © Getty Images\n\nBy the mid- to late 20th century, cricket was reduced to being largely a novelty sport, though expats would often hold exhibition games, as Eddie Phillips, a cricketer from Brighton in England did on his holiday in St Louis.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe the pitches in New Orleans.

        "title": "Canada’s Debut At T20 World Cup Drives Cricket Growth In North America",
        "date": "Tue May 21 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "The Cricket T20 World Cup is approaching fast. Anticipation for the first match between the co-hosts, the United States and their North American neighbors Canada on June 1 is gaining momentum. The game will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium, the former home of the Texas AirHogs and venue of the first Major League Cricket season last year.\n\nWhile much focus is on whether the home nation can compete with the giants of their group, India and Pakistan, the Canadians can slip happily below the radar. In a warm-up five match series with their nearest rivals, geographically at least, they lost 4-0 with one match washed out. Expectation isn't huge. Historically, the Maple Leafers can at least claim the bragging rights over the U.S. with a famous win in the first recorded international cricket match in 1844.\n\nThere’s a huge heritage in Canadian cricket and the continuation of the annual Auty Cup is a nod to the connection between the two nations on the green fields before baseball pitched up. Once upon a time on the prairie, cricket was declared Canada’s national sport by its first-ever PM John A Macdonald. The Toronto Cricket Club was established in 1827 although the inception of the game was strongly influenced by the missions of the Royal Navy and the British Army. George A. Barber, an English schoolmaster, was prominent in setting up the Toronto Club and is known as the father of Canadian cricket.\n\nThe most important development in recent times for the international team has been regaining their ODI status after almost a decade out of he mainstream loop. “Regaining (the ODI) status after nine long years is an outstanding achievement and a game-changing moment for Cricket Canada. It puts us on the same map as the leading Associate cricketing nations in the world,” said a jubilant former Cricket Canada President Rashpal Bajwa to the Emerging Cricket site this time last year.\n\nIt has been a long journey back for a country that had appeared in the 1979, 2003, 2007 and 2011 50-over World Cups before the ICC introduced the new World Cricket League divisional structure. This meant Associate members needed to finish in the top six of the World Cricket League Division 2 tournament. At their lowest ebb, Canada were languishing in League Division Three by 2017.\n\nThis has resulted in difficulties retaining a solid playing pool. In a 2015 interview with ESPNcricinfo, former captain Rizwan Cheema summed up the mood: “Once you slip down the pecking order [in Associate cricket] it's hard to climb out. It's hard to even have players for the team. If there's no career as a cricketer, how do you keep your players interested?\"\n\nNow the surge, the revival, is making the Maple Leaf fly in the wind again. Cricket is the fastest-growing sport in the country, supercharged with the return of the GT20, a franchise that first appeared with considerable success in 2018 when it attracted stars like Steve Smith, Chris Gayle, David Warner and Andre Russell. Before the pandemic, it was the most watched event in North America outside of the Super Bowl.\n\nIn the 2023 GT20 season, six teams were allocated $579,000 to spend on a 16-man roster with the proviso that at least six Canadians would be included and that three must be in the starting XI. That averaged at $36,000 per player and again attracted a healthy cohort of international stars who could energize and educate homegrown talent. Tim Southee, Mohammad Rizwan, Rassie van der Dussen, and World No. 1 allrounder Shakib Al Hasan were among the luminaries. Gayle, now very much in his dotage at 44, also returned for the fun as did Pakistan cricket legend Shahid Afridi.\n\nThe action took place in Ontario's Brampton sports complex which is aiming to morph into a major cricket international facility. The City has allocated $7 million for further growth although funding might be three or four times more than an estimated $49 million to expand the current CAA Centre from a 5,000-seater to a fully-fledged and equipped venue.\n\nThe tournament was broadcast to 110 countries around the world with an estimated television audience of about 150 million people globally, the vast majority of which was outside North America. The trick now is to grow the grassroots game and get away from the part-time \"weekend warriors\" contracts of the past. There's still a dearth of dedicated cricket grounds as many matches are played in multi-sport venues. Canada's elevation to League 2 will ensure the squad are paid salaries between $55,000 to $65,000 and will train full-time.\n\nCanada’s first venture into the T20 World Cup is led by 37-year-old skipper Saad Bin Zafar, a veteran of 38 T20Is. Like the U.S. team, most of the playing members are thirtysomething and of Indian or Pakistan origin although opening bat Aaron Johnson brings some Caribbean flair to the team. His 74 at Prairie View in the second T20 against the States in April came at a strike rate of 184 with six sixes. Canada will need something special from him in the real thing."

At least two of the three American venues will host matches, with a site for the India v Bangladesh warm-up match on June 1 yet to be confirmed though the expectation is that it will be played at the newly unveiled Nassau County International Stadium.\n\nUSA’s pair of warm-up fixtures have been announced for May 28 and 30 to both be played at Grand Prairie Stadium, 12 miles west of Dallas, Texas. In a peculiar decision, USA will play Bangladesh in an official warm-up match on May 28 despite the fact that USA is already scheduled to play three official T20Is against Bangladesh at Prairie View Cricket Complex from May 21-25. USA’s second official warm-up match will be played against Nepal on May 30.\n\nNepal will also have an earlier warm-up match to be played against Canada on May 27 in Grand Prairie, which will be the first international matches of any kind – warm-up or full T20Is – to be played at Grand Prairie Stadium. The USA v Nepal match on May 30 will be part of a doubleheader in which the second match of the day will feature Netherlands against Canada to complete the set of four warm-up matches to be played at the facility which reopened in 2023 – and hosted the first season of the Major League Cricket T20 franchise tournament – following an estimated $20 million renovation from its original layout as a minor league baseball stadium.\n\nBroward County Stadium in Lauderhill, Florida will be hosting three warm-up matches, beginning on May 28 when Netherlands plays Sri Lanka. It will be the first of two warm-up matches for Sri Lanka at the facility. They will also take on Ireland on May 31 before both teams travel to New York ahead of their first matches of the tournament. Sri Lanka starts off their Group D slate against South Africa on June 3 at Nassau County International Stadium while Ireland opens on June 5 at the same venue against India.\n\nThe remaining warm-up fixture scheduled for Broward County Stadium is an intrasquad match for South Africa on May 29. It is the only intrasquad practice match officially scheduled by the ICC for any team in the tournament.\n\nThe final warm-up fixture between India and Bangladesh is yet to be given a designated venue by the ICC. The expectation is that it will be held in New York on June 1 at Nassau County International Stadium so that the ICC can have at least one match played on the new drop-in wickets that have been installed at the newly opened venue in Long Island, New York before the official first T20I is played at the venue on June 3. But if the New York venue – which took less than four months to complete at an estimated $30 million cost – is unavailable for any reason, the match may be held at Broward County Stadium or canceled outright because Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas will be unavailable that day since it is due to host the opening match of the tournament that night between USA and Canada.\n\nA total of eight other warm-up matches are slated to be held in Trinidad & Tobago – the only Caribbean venue due to host any official warm-up matches – at both Brian Lara Academy and Queen’s Park Oval. The only two Full Member to have two warm-ups scheduled in Trinidad are Australia and Afghanistan. Australia will play Namibia on May 28 and West Indies on May 30. Afghanistan are set to face Oman on May 29 and Scotland on May 31.\n\nAssociate sides Papua New Guinea, Oman, Uganda, Scotland and Namibia all have two warm-up matches scheduled. The only tournament participants not to have any warm-ups scheduled against other teams are England, South Africa, Pakistan, New Zealand and Zimbabwe."

Roy’s decision will not effect his future selection prospects, with the batter still England’s incumbent opener in ODI cricket ahead of their World Cup defence in India this autumn.\n\nIn a statement, Roy insisted representing England remained his chief priority.\n\n“I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will ‘walk away from England’,” Roy said. “Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer. I hope to play for England for many more years.”\n\nRoy is set to become the first English player to sign up to the new competition, which takes place in Texas during the final two weeks of July, with reports suggesting he is likely to turn out for the LA Knight Riders, one of six newly-formed teams, four of which are at least partially backed by IPL owners.\n\nRoy has just returned from a stint with Kolkata Knight Riders at the IPL and is set to make his first Surrey appearance of the season in Thursday’s Blast opener against Middlesex at Lord’s.\n\nIt is understood that Roy will still be available for the entirety of Surrey’s Blast campaign, including Finals Day on July 15 should the county get that far, before flying to the US and then returning in time to play for Oval Invincibles in the Hundred.\n\nRoy was demoted to an incremental deal last October, having been dropped by England’s T20 side ahead of their successful World Cup campaign, and will now forgo the remainder of his salary up until the contract was due to expire at the end of September.\n\nIncremental contracts are worth between £60,000 and £70,000 a year and Roy could earn more than twice that amount for just two weeks’ work in the US."

        "body": "The USA acquired ODI status in 2019 and are looking for active international cricketers so that they can make a strong squad to live up to the status. Several big names are in line to represent the USA in international cricket. USA Cricket received a major boost when Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan's Kolkata Knight Riders announced that it would invest in Major League cricket (MLC), a tournament emulating the IPL, as well as own a franchise in it.\n\nThe USA are targeting players who haven't been selected in international cricket for some time and are ready to shift there to rekindle their careers in cricket.\n\nThe Business Standard (TBS) looks at five cricketers who have recently opted to play cricket for the USA.\n\nCorey Anderson\n\nCorey Anderson, an explosive left-handed batter and a useful medium-pace bowler, is a great addition to the USA's cricket set-up. The former Black Caps all-rounder once held the record of the fastest century in ODIs. He has made 93 appearances for New Zealand across formats and won them several games. Anderson was part of the 2015 World Cup squad that came second in the tournament.\n\nThe all-rounder's international career has been plagued by injuries. The 30-year-old called time on his international career last year and signed a three-year deal with the USA's Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nSami Aslam\n\nSami Aslam captained Pakistan to the final of the 2014 Under-19 World Cup in the UAE. The talented left-handed batter made his international debut in 2015. Aslam played 13 Tests and four ODIs for Pakistan and since then he has fallen out of favor. In November 2020, the 25-year old cut ties with Pakistan Cricket with the aim of representing the USA.\n\nAslam said that he wasn't happy with the way he was treated and added that he was more than happy to be in America after being depressed in Pakistan for two years. He will be eligible to play for the USA in 2023. Recently he was selected in the players' draft ahead of Minor League Cricket (MLC).\n\nDane Piedt\n\nDane Piedt, former Protea off-spinner who played nine Tests, ended his association with Cricket South Africa last year and shifted to South Africa to play in the Minor League Cricket (MLC).\n\n\"It was an opportunity I just couldn't pass up, financially and for lifestyle reasons, but it was still a tough decision to make,\" he said.\n\nPiedt made his Test debut in 2014 and delivered a career-best performance to thump Zimbabwe. His last appearance in international cricket was in 2019 against India. Piedt is a prolific performer in South Africa's domestic set-up, having picked up more than 400 first-class wickets.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nShehan Jayasuriya is another exciting addition to USA Cricket as he retired from the Sri Lanka cricket team earlier this year and decided to relocate to the USA with his family. Jayasuriya is a handy all-around cricketer, batting left-handed and bowling right-arm off-spin. He played 30 international matches for Sri Lanka but couldn't really replicate the success he had in domestic cricket.\n\nJayasuriya last played an international match for Sri Lanka in March 2019. In June 2021, he was selected in the players' draft ahead of Minor League Cricket (MLC).\n\nUnmukt Chand\n\nUnmukt Chand was earmarked to become a superstar of Indian cricket after he led India to glory in the 2012 ICC Under-19 World Cup. He made a sensational hundred against Australia in the final of that tournament and became a household name in India. He played for India A regularly from 2013 to 2015. Chand represented three IPL franchises but failed to live up to his immense potential.\n\nThe 28-year-old cricketer has relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and signed a multi-year agreement with Major League Cricket in the USA. The 28-year old will be eligible to play for the USA after serving the residency period."

By adding the Knight Riders Group to our family of world-class and diverse investors, this investment into the future of Major League Cricket is a huge validation of our vision for the new league, and we are particularly excited to have such an iconic cricketing brand onboard with us.\n\n“As USA Cricket’s official partner in developing a professional T20 league in America, we have a shared vision to bring world-class professional cricket to the world’s largest sports market. The announcement today is a significant step forward in showing the potential of the American market, and we are delighted to have the backing and expertise of the Knight Riders Group to help us achieve this vision.”"

        "body": "Plagued by injuries, New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson, who once held the record for fastest ODI hundred, called time on his international career and signed a three-year deal with USA's Major League Cricket (MLC). The 29-year-old, who has played 13 Tests, 49 ODIs, and 31 T20Is for New Zealand, didn't feature in any of Black Caps' assignment for the past two years.\n\nIn the 93 international games across formats, he scored 2277 runs with two hundred and 10 half-centuries. He also picked up 90 wickets. \"It's been a huge honor and (I am) extremely proud to represent New Zealand,\" Anderson, who holds the record for the fastest ODI century for his 36-ball innings against West Indies in 2013, was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.\n\nHis 36-ball hundred against West Indies on New Year's Day in 2014, was the fastest ODI hundred for a year before AB de Villiers' broke the record with a 31-ball feat against the same opposition. Anderson lamented the fact that he couldn't play more international games for his country.\n\n\"I would have loved to have achieved and played more but just is what it is sometimes, and different opportunities arise and send you in a direction you never thought would be a possibility. Very appreciative for everything that NZC has done for me.\"\n\nAnderson also played in the IPL for Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians, and Royal Challengers Bangalore and also was a part of New Zealand's runners-up finish at the 2015 World Cup. However, his career was affected by multiple injuries, including a spate of stress fractures, groin injuries, and chronic back issues. He last played a T20I for New Zealand in November 2018.\n\n\"It hasn't been an easy decision. I asked myself several questions. What do I want to do now or what do I want to achieve in the next two years, five years, 10 years?\" he said. \"As you get older you think about life a little bit more broadly as well. And obviously, my fiance, Mary Margaret, who's born and raised in America, she's had a massive part to play in that because she's sacrificed so much for me.\n\n\"So, when the opportunity arose, we thought that living in America is the best thing, not only for my cricket, but it's, it's the best thing for both of us in general as well.\"\n\nAnderson recently featured in the Caribbean Premier League for the Barbados Tridents in August."

        "date": "Thu May 23 06:49:49 2024",
        "body": "NEW YORK: The US cricket team which will co-host the Twenty20 World Cup may be a fitting cross-section of its country as a roster of migrants, a melting pot of nationalities and cultures.\n\nThe 15-man squad includes players born in India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa. Home-grown players include vice-captain Aaron Jones, who was born in Queens, and allrounder Steven Taylor, of Hialeah, Florida.\n\nThe team provides a snapshot of US cricket at this formative stage, as Major League Cricket jostles for its place in a crowded sporting market. The squad includes foreign players drawn to America by the MLC and local players given the chance to play cricket at a professional level in the United States\n\nThe home team’s most recognized member is the former New Zealand allrounder Corey Anderson. The 33-year-old Anderson played 13 Tests, 49 one-day internationals and 31 T20 internationals for New Zealand between 2013 and 2018 in a career limited by injuries.\n\nHe earned a place in cricket history for his 36-ball century in a one-day international between New Zealand and the West Indies on New Year’s Day, 2014. Anderson also has played in T20 leagues in Australia, India, the Caribbean and UAE before finding an MLC home at the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nAnderson made his first half-century for the US in their T20 win over Canada last month.\n\nMumbai-born Harmeet Singh, who played for India at two Under-19 World Cups, was the star for the 19th-ranked US team earlier this week in an upset win over Bangladesh. It the only the second win over a full ICC member for the US\n\nHe scored 33 from the 13 deliveries he faced and shared an unbeaten, match-winning 62-run partnership with Anderson, who was unbeaten on 34.\n\n“It means a lot to us to put on a show against Bangladesh. We are no walkovers,” Harmeet told ESPNcricinfo. “I think our potential is immense.”\n\nThe US meet Canada in the tournament opener on June 1 and then there’ll be a step up for both teams in Group A, which also includes India and Pakistan, fierce cricket rivals with enormous support, and Ireland.\n\nAmong the other foreign-born players on the US squad coached by ex-Australia batter Stuart Law is right-arm fast bowler Ali Khan, who moved with his parents from Pakistan to the US when he was 18.\n\nHe first played for the US team in 2016 and has also has played in the Indian Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and Pakistan Premier League, in Global T20 Canada and the Afghanistan Premier League.\n\nCaptain Monank Patel, a wicketkeeper-batsman, was born in India and settled in New Jersey after moving permanently to the US in 2016. He played at a junior level for Gujarat in India and played the first of his 47 one-day internationals and 23 T20 internationals for the US in 2019.\n\nAndries Gous, another wicketkeeper-batsmen, was born in Welkom, South Africa, played for South Africa at under-19 level and played 60 first-class matches before relocating to the US in 2021. He and Patel were the highest scorers for the US in the recent five-match series against Canada.\n\nAllrounder Milind Kumar is another India-born player who accumulated nine centuries in 60 first-class appearances for Delhi before making his home in the US\n\nThe Canada team scheduled to meet the US in the opening match is also a team drawn from many places and shaped by the evolution of a professional league at home.\n\nCanada will be led by the veteran left-armer spinner Saad bin Zafar, who was born in Pakistan. He moved to Canada to study and was first named in the Canadian T20 team in 2008. Now 37, he has played 38 T20 internationals and once took two wickets without conceding a run in four overs in a T20 against Panama.\n\nJamaica-born batter Aaron Johnson, Pakistan-born left-arm fast bowler Kaleem Sana and Guyana-born right-arm quick Dillon Heyliger reflect the international makeup of the team which is coached by former Sri Lanka international Pubudu Dassanayake.\n\nFred Trueman of Yorkshire and England was long regarded as his nation’s greatest fast bowler. In his prime, he bowled a thousand overs for Yorkshire during a summer.\n\nThis was an era when the only cricket matches on view, apart from Tests, were three-day county championships between 17 counties. In 1964, Trueman was the first bowler to claim 300 wickets in Test matches. When asked if he thought his achievement would be beaten, his response — typical of the man — was: “Aye, but whoever does it will be very tired.”\n\nSince then, 36 bowlers have beaten Trueman’s record. Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan claimed 800, followed by Australia’s Shane Warne with 708, and then there is England’s James Anderson, who has 700 and is due to play his last Test this year.\n\nAnderson’s longevity and fitness is truly remarkable. He has sent down almost 40,000 deliveries in Test matches alone, the fourth highest among those taking more than three hundred wickets. He is not admitting to any tiredness and is regarded by some as having claim to be England’s finest quick bowler, rather than Trueman. Both their achievements, in different eras, are extraordinary. Trueman’s feat was accompanied by a bowling average of 21.57, only bettered by Malcom Marshall (20.94) and Curtly Ambrose (20.99). Anderson’s is 26.52.\n\nIt is against the background of these achievements that current cries for help by professional cricketers to reduce their workload should be gauged. Another of Yorkshire’s finest players is Joe Root who, in 140 Tests for England so far, has scored 11,626 runs. This puts him 10th on the all-time list of top Test run scorers. His workload has been intense for years, even more so when he captained England in 64 Tests, yet he rarely complains. Last week, however, he called for a major rethink of English cricket’s crowded schedule.\n\nThis was accompanied by the Professional Cricketers Association calling for change “before something disastrous happens.”\n\nBased on a survey of professional male cricketers, the PCA revealed that key concerns are physical heath (81 percent), travel conditions (75 percent) and mental health (62 percent). Long-distance driving late at night, whether moving between matches or traveling home, is a particular worry. It is argued that player welfare and performance are compromised by the lack of time to recover, prepare and practice.\n\nProfessional cricket in England and Wales has a particular issue in that there are four men’s competitions shoe-horned into a window between mid-April and the end of September, with August given over entirely to The Hundred. Last year, proposals to reduce the amount of four-day county cricket and T20 cricket were rejected by the counties. Effectively, the 50 over competition has been downgraded because so few of the top players appear in it. According to Root, the objective should be to get “the standard of first-class and county cricket as close as you can to the international game.”\n\nProfessional cricketers in England and Wales have raised the issue of congested schedules and travelling pressure before. The explosion of T20 cricket in the last 20 years has increased this congestion and turned it into a more international concern. In India and Australia, for example, the distances between venues are much greater, with flying and its attendant risks additional factors.\n\nIn November 2023, during the announcement of India’s ODI squad for a series against Australia, India’s captain, Rohit Sharma, blamed excessive travel for injured players across the teams. It is in the interests of all cricket boards to narrow the gap between the standard of the breeding ground of first-class cricket and international cricket. Each one has different ways of doing so, a reflection of relative resources, geography and historic structures.\n\nIn India, reform is proposed for 2024-25. It seems likely that the Ranji Trophy, the country’s state-based long format game and the equivalent of the English county championship, will be split into two halves. White ball tournaments would be held in between. The main drivers behind this are to address variable winter weather conditions in the north and to allow longer gaps between matches to facilitate travel and recovery. This is similar reasoning to that aired by Joe Root and the PCA.\n\nMore forgiving schedules may release pressure on mental health, an often-overlooked facet of professional sport. There have been a number of high-profile cases in recent years in cricket. Azeem Rafiq’s experience of racism at Yorkshire was one. Another was Jonathan Trott, who played 52 Tests for England between 2009 and 2015. He left England’s tour of Australia in November 2013, unable to cope with the demands at that level. A man with very high levels of concentration lost them and referred to the impact of social media, saying: “People don't look you in the face and have a conversation and ask you how you are.”\n\nRohit Sharma, in the aftermath of India’s defeat in the 2023 ODI World Cup Final, was mentally shattered. He eschewed social media and opted out of ODI and T20I assignments against South Africa. Men’s cricket is a tough environment that appears not to appreciate that mental health issues are real. The growth of women’s cricket has brought about a change in approaches to mental health within the game. A webinar which I joined this week promoted by the Cricket Research Network discussed the different physiological challenges which women face in advancing in the game.\n\nQuite what Fred Trueman would have made of this is an open question. He was an un-constituted menacing quick bowler who bullied opponents. It is not unreasonable to assume he would have been aghast at the notion of women playing professional cricket.\n\nAfter his playing days were over, he became a pundit and commentator. His catch line was: “I don’t know what is going on.” He would be even more at a loss in today’s world of social media and Bollywood-style cricket.\n\nMUMBAI: Nicholas Pooran starred in Lucknow Super Giants’ 18-run victory over pre-tournament favorites Mumbai Indians in the last game of a disappointing Indian Premier League season for both teams Friday.\n\nThe maverick West Indies’ wicketkeeper-batsman hit eight sixes in his 29-ball 75 to take Lucknow to 214-6 after Mumbai skipper Hardik Pandya won the toss and chose to field first.\n\nMumbai crashed to 196-6 despite an impressive start by openers Rohit Sharma and Dewald Brevis in their rain-interrupted chase.\n\nPandya said that it was “quite difficult” for five-time champions Mumbai, who finished the 10-team league in last spot.\n\n“This season we didn’t play good quality cricket and it cost us the whole season,” Pandya said.\n\nLucknow too failed to qualify for the playoffs and ended the tournament in sixth spot.\n\nCaptain KL Rahul said that it was “very disappointing.”\n\nHe blamed mid-season injuries to key players and said that they “didn’t play well enough collectively and couldn’t come together” as a team.\n\nEarlier, Nuwan Thushara got Mumbai off to a great start and removed opener Devdutt Padikkal for a first ball duck.\n\nPadikkal’s partner Rahul stitched together a 48-run partnership with Australia’s Marcus Stoinis, who fell to Piyush Chawla’s leg-spin for a 22-ball 28 in the sixth over.\n\nChawla also removed Deepak Hooda (11) to reduce Lucknow to 69-3 by the 10th over.\n\nThushara finally removed Pooran in the 17th over to end his match-defining, 109-run partnership with Rahul.\n\nHe also removed rookie Arshad Khan (0) in the same over and finished with 3-28 in his four-over spell.\n\nChawla removed Rahul, who took 41 balls for his 55 runs, in the 18th over and finished with 3-29.\n\nKey unbeaten cameos by Ayush Badoni (22) and Krunal Pandya (12) took Lucknow to 214-6.\n\nMumbai’s openers took their team to 88 before Brevis fell for 23 in the ninth over.\n\nIndia skipper Sharma top-scored with a 38-ball 68 with 10 fours and three sixes before he fell in the 11th over.\n\nIn between, Mumbai also lost their best T20 batsman, Suryakumar Yadav, for 0 and were reduced to 97-3 while out-of-form skipper Pandya fell for 16.\n\nIndian rookie Naman Dhir hit five sixes and four fours in his unbeaten 28-ball 62.\n\nLeg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi, who removed Sharma, and Afghanistan’s Naveen-ul-Haq, who removed Brevis, took four key Mumbai wickets between them.\n\nOn May 11, the second of a four-day county championship match unfolded in front of my eyes at the Utilita Bowl, Southampton. This is the home of Hampshire County Cricket Club. On a rare sunny day, there seemed to be around 600 other people watching, a majority in the members’ area.\n\nHampshire CCC is unusual in that it is one of three out of the 18 county cricket clubs in England and Wales that are not subject to member votes. It is owned by Hampshire Sport & Leisure Holdings, a private limited company which oversees sporting and leisure activities on the site. Its former chair, who was instrumental in saving the county from insolvency in 2001, owns 60 percent of the shares.\n\nBy coincidence, Hampshire’s opponents were Durham County Cricket Club, another county not subject to member votes. It is constituted as a Community Interest Company, a form of social enterprise. Northamptonshire County Cricket Club is the third one not to be subject to member votes, being constituted as a private company limited by guarantee.\n\nThe scene at Southampton would have been replicated at the other five county championship matches taking place on May 11. At the same time in Kolkata, the Knight Riders and the Mumbai Indians were preparing to play the 60th match of the 2024 Indian Premier League franchise competition. Average spectator attendance in the IPL is estimated to be 30,000. These two different models of promoting cricket may be about to coalesce, if proposed changes to the landscape in England and Wales come to fruition.\n\nThe changes center on The Hundred, a format of cricket introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board in 2021. The two teams each play a single innings of 100 deliveries, divided into 20 overs of five deliveries, with two overs bowled from each end alternately. Each match is scheduled to last for two-and-a-half hours. Eight men’s teams and eight women’s teams comprise separate competitions with all matches played back-to-back on the same day at the same venue. The whole of August is allocated to The Hundred to the exclusion of other formats.\n\nEver since its inception, the tournament has been divisive on several levels. First, it has segregated the 18 counties into those who host The Hundred and those who do not. The eight participating counties are Glamorgan, Hampshire, Lancashire, Middlesex, Nottinghamshire, Surrey, Warwickshire and Yorkshire. However, the teams do not carry the county names, since the concept was to create city-based teams using existing county facilities. Agreement to progress with the tournament depended upon the support of excluded counties. This was achieved by the ECB’s offer to pay each county £1.3 million ($1.6 million) for their backing.\n\nAt a second level, there are differing opinions about the opportunity cost of this funding. The ECB receives around 75 percent of its income from the sale of broadcasting rights, a substantial part of which relates to Test-match cricket. Critics argue that using this money to support and develop a format which represents an existential threat to Test cricket is willful. They argue that the funds should be deployed in producing players for the longer rather than shorter formats.\n\nOn a third level, it is argued that the focus on eight counties, instead of 18, will hasten the demise of some of the latter, several of whom are in parlous financial circumstances. It is understood that, in the last two years, five counties have received financial help from the ECB. Overall debt levels in county cricket may be in the order of £200 million, some of this being incurred in stadium development designed to host international matches. In addition, operational costs have increased sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is in this context that the ECB’s current proposal to sell off 49 percent of equity in The Hundred has great attraction. The balance of 51 percent would be owned by the host county, which can decide to retain it all or sell part or all of it. The proceeds of the 49 percent are to be distributed to counties according to an undisclosed formula. The ECB requested that counties agreed to a “direction of travel” by May 10.\n\nA divergence of opinion has emerged amongst the counties about the proposed model for distributing the spoils, split broadly between those who host The Hundred and those who do not. Needless to say, both sides appear to want more. In terms of numbers, some reports assert that the ECB’s sale of 49 percent equity might raise some $507 million (£400 million) for distribution, enough to salve the cash problems of a few counties. It is understandable that the non-hosting counties fear that they could get sold down the river.\n\nThere is already a fear that they are becoming marginalized by not being a host of The Hundred format. If the money raised by the ECB falls well short of the $507 million, then their financial problems may not be solved and their marginalization exacerbated. There are also legitimate concerns over governance and scheduling issues once private owners become involved. At this stage, the nature of private investors is unknown. It would be no surprise if Indian franchise owners show interest. However, it is reasonable to assume that they would not be content with either a minority stake or minority voice.\n\nCricket in England and Wales is at a watershed moment, caught in a maze of alternative possibilities, each one of which has unknown consequences. The ECB, under previous management, was the architect of this moment, through its introduction of The Hundred, which is contracted to run until 2028. In a twist of fate, it is now regarded as a medium for escape from impecunity. The alternative to equity sale is to do nothing and watch the system crumble. Equity sale will be tantamount to privatizing a part of that system. It was difficult to escape the feeling at Southampton that I was watching one part of that system which is heading for trauma.\n\nGUWAHATI, India: Skipper Sam Curran starred with bat and ball as Punjab Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by five wickets for a consolation win in the Indian Premier League on Wednesday.\n\nChasing a tricky 145 on a sluggish pitch, Punjab depended on Curran’s unbeaten 63 to achieve their target with seven balls to spare in Rajasthan’s adopted home ground in Guwahati.\n\nLeft-handed Curran put on a key 63-run stand with Jitesh Sharma, who made 22, and despite losing his partner in the 16th over steered the team home to lift them from the bottom of the 10-team table.\n\nImpact substitute Ashutosh Sharma smashed 17 and the winning run to hand Rajasthan their fourth successive defeat in this edition of the T20 tournament.\n\n“To be very honest, we have to sit back and accept that we are going through some failures,” Rajasthan skipper Sanju Samson said.\n\n“You have to find out what’s not working well as a team. When you are getting to the business end, we need someone to raise their finger up and say I am going to win the game for the team. We have the players who can do that.”\n\nThe loss for Rajasthan hurt their chances of a top-two finish in the league stage a day after they confirmed their play-off spot.\n\nRajasthan, who stay in second place with one game in hand, and table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders are the only two teams to have booked their play-off berth.\n\nThe top four teams make the play-offs, but the first and second-placed sides have the advantage of two chances to qualify for the final on May 26 in Chennai.\n\nPunjab, who had already bowed out of the play-off race, kept the opposition down to 144-9 despite a 34-ball 48 by Riyan Parag.\n\nLeft-arm quick Curran bowled Yashasvi Jaiswal, for four, in the first over and then Samson departed for 18 off Nathan Ellis after a slow start.\n\nParag found Ravichandran Ashwin, who hit 28 off 19 balls, for company and the two attempted to push the scoring in their partnership of 50.\n\nThe rest of the batting faltered against a disciplined attack as Curran, fellow quick Harshal Patel and spinner Rahul Chahal took two wickets each.\n\nNEW DELHI: Fiery fifties from Abishek Porel and Tristan Stubbs helped Delhi Capitals sign off their IPL league phase on a high as they beat Lucknow Super Giants by 19 runs on Tuesday.\n\nThe win took Delhi to 14 points in 14 matches and they remain technically in the mix to reach the play-offs of the T20 tournament, but a run-rate in the negative keeps their chances slim.\n\n“We are still in contention even after the last game,” Delhi skipper Rishabh Pant said after he returned to lead the side following a one-match ban for slow over-rate.\n\n“We had a better chance of qualifying if I would have had a chance to play in the last game (which Delhi lost).”\n\nThe left-handed Porel hit 58 before Stubbs smashed an unbeaten 57 off 25 balls to steer Delhi to 208-4 after being invited to bat first at their high-scoring home venue, Arun Jaitley Stadium.\n\nPant, a left-handed wicketkeeper-batsman, made 33 to cap off an impressive season after he came back in the IPL from a horror car crash in December 2022.\n\n“Personally, it was fantastic to come back,” said Pant, who has been picked in India’s squad for the T20 World Cup next month.\n\n“It was heartening to see the support from entire India. Was a long time to wait after one-and-a-half years. I want to be on the field all the time. Don’t want to miss any action.”\n\nKL Rahul-led Lucknow have 12 points with one more match to play and have their hopes hanging by a thread.\n\nThe result confirmed a play-off spot for Rajasthan Royals, who became the second team to enter the final four alongside table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nThe top four teams make the play-offs. The final is on May 26 in Chennai.\n\nIshant Sharma led the bowling charge with three early wickets as Delhi restricted Lucknow to 189-9 despite valiant knocks from Nicholas Pooran, who smashed 61, and Arshad Khan, who hit an unbeaten 58.\n\nDelhi lost attacking opener Jake Fraser-McGurk for a duck but Porel and Shai Hope, who struck 38, put on 92 runs to lay the foundations of the big total.\n\nDelhi stuttered in the middle after they lost Porel, Hope and then Pant at regular intervals and Lucknow bowlers checked the flow of runs.\n\nBut Stubbs had other ideas and he hit back with a flurry of fours and sixes to fire Delhi past the 200 as the last three overs cost Lucknow 45 runs.\n\nLucknow suffered early blows after pace spearhead Ishant took down Rahul, for five, and Quinton de Kock, for 12, inside three overs.\n\nMarcus Stoinis was stumped by Pant off spinner Axar Patel and Ishant, who was named man of the match, struck again to make Lucknow slip to 44-4.\n\nStubbs made it count with his off-spin as he sent back impact substitute Ayush Badoni out for six to end a 27-run partnership with Pooran.\n\nThe left-handed Pooran attempted to drive the chase in his 27-ball knock laced with six fours and four sixes but he left a lot to be done when he departed in the 12th over.\n\nNumber eight Arshad then raised hopes of a turnaround with his late charge as he raised his first T20 50 in 25 balls to give Delhi a scare.\n\nArshad kept losing partners as he continued the charge but in the end failed to match up the asking-rate."

        "body": "The Prairie View Cricket Complex is a group of six cricket grounds located in the city of Prairie View, part of the Greater Houston area in Texas, United States.\n\nJointly-owned by Pakistani American businessman Tanweer Ahmed and Major League Cricket, the Prairie View Cricket Complex was established in 2018 and has a seating capacity of 10,000.\n\nThe Prairie View Cricket Complex is an 86-acre facility that is entirely devoted to cricket. It comprises five turf wicket cricket grounds and a hybrid turf ground.\n\nThe massive cricket complex now hosts about 20 tournaments and around 500 games annually along with MLC.\n\nIt staged its first international cricket match, a T20 played between hosts United States and Canada in April 2024. The hosts won the game by six wickets.\n\nSince then, it has hosted four T20 internationals. It will also stage the upcoming USA vs Bangladesh T20I series ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nLet’s have a closer look at the Prairie View Cricket Complex T20 records and stats.\n\nPrairie View Cricket Complex T20 records and stats\n\nHighest total\n\nThe United States national cricket team holds the record for the highest total at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in T20 cricket. During the second T20I of Canada’s tour of the United States of America, the Monank Patel-led hosts posted 230/3 in their 20 overs against Canada in April 2024. The United States rode on fifties from captain Monank Patel (68), Andries Gous (57) and Steven Taylor (54) to post a record T20 total at the venue. In reply, Canada were bowled out for 199 in 19.4 overs as the hosts won the game by 31 runs.\n\nLowest total\n\nThe Canada national cricket team registered the lowest total at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in the T20 format. Put into bat, the visitors were bundled out for 132 in the first T20I of Canada’s tour of the United States of America in April 2024.Captain Saad Bin Zafar top-scored for Canada with 29 off 16 balls. For the USA, left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was the wrecker-in-chief with three wickets. The hosts later chased down the target in 17.3 overs to win the game by six wickets.\n\nMost runs\n\nCanada’s Aaron Johnson has scored the most runs at the venue in T20 cricket. The swashbuckling right-handed batter has amassed 124 runs in four T20 matches at an average of 31 and a strike rate of 144.18. The United States national cricket team captain Monank Patel features second on the list with 120 runs in three T20 matches at an average of 40 and a strike rate of 169.01.\n\nMost wickets\n\nUSA’s Harmeet Singh and Shadley van Schalkwyk share the record for the most wickets at this cricket ground in the T20 format. Left-arm spinner Harmeet Singh has claimed six wickets in four T20I games at an average of 12.66 and an economy of 5.56. Meanwhile, right-arm medium pacer Shadley van Schalkwyk has also picked up six T20I wickets in four matches at an average of 22.16 and an economy of 9.50.\n\nHighest individual score\n\nAaron Johnson has the record for the highest individual score at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in T20 cricket. Canada’s star opening batter Aaron Johnson slammed 74 off just 40 balls while chasing USA’s 230/3 in the second T20I of a five-match series in April 2024. Johnson’s scintillating knock was laced with six fours and six maximums. Despite his impressive knock, Canada fell short by 31 runs in Texas.\n\nBest bowling figures\n\nIndian-American cricketer Harmeet Singh has the best bowling figures at this venue in the T20 format. The USA left-arm spinner registered match-winning figures of 4/18 against Canada in the fourth T20I of a five-match series. Defending 159, Harmeet Singh dismissed Aaron Johnson, Dilpreet Bajwa, Pargat Singh and wicketkeeper-batter Shreyas Movva to restrict Canada to 145/6 in their 20 overs. Harmeet’s impressive spell helped USA register a 14-run victory in Texas\n\nHighest partnership\n\nUnited States’ Monank Patel and Steven Taylor hold the record for the highest partnership at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in T20 cricket. Monank Patel and Steven Taylor forged a 104-run partnership for the opening wicket against Canada in the second T20I. While Taylor scored 54, Monank slammed 68. USA won the game by 31 runs.
