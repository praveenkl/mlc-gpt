        "date": "Tue May 28 19:46:00 2024",
        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC), the burgeoning T20 tournament in the USA, has achieved a significant milestone by acquiring List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) just before its second season. This achievement places MLC as the second Associate-run franchise competition to receive List A status, following the UAE's ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThe elevation to List A status signifies a formal recognition of MLC as an official T20 league, with all tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics. Justin Geale, the tournament director, expressed enthusiasm about this development, highlighting the recognition of the tournament's high standards and the quality of players involved. He mentioned that this recognition would enhance the credibility of cricket in the USA on a global scale.\n\nGeale thanked the ICC for acknowledging MLC's unique position as an Associate nation, emphasizing the tournament's role in providing a platform for some of the world's best players to showcase their skills alongside their peers.\n\nMLC's 2024 edition is set to commence on July 5, immediately following the conclusion of the T20 World Cup on June 29 in Bridgetown. This timing marks a crucial period for cricket's efforts to establish a strong presence in the US market.\n\nIn addition to the List A status, MLC has unveiled plans for expansion, aiming to grow from six teams to 10 over the next few years. The number of games is also set to increase, from 19 in 2023 to 34 by 2025, with 25 games scheduled for the upcoming season.\n\nVijay Srinivasan, MLC's chief executive, outlined the league's vision for expansion and scheduling adjustments to avoid clashes with other prominent cricket events. He discussed plans to start the league earlier in June to coincide with the school holidays in the US, providing a favorable window for MLC's growth.\n\n\"It was always intended to be a 10-team league,\" MLC's chief executive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the Guardian. \"Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that's our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.\"\n\n\"Ultimately for us, our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,\" Srinivasan said. \"With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That's how we would like to establish our window.\"\n\nLast year, the MLC concluded just two days before the start of the Hundred. However, this time there will be a six-day overlap between the two leagues, with the MLC ending on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. Consequently, up to half of the overseas players in the Hundred may arrive in the UK late after the MLC ends. Twelve out of the 24 overseas players contracted in the men's Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in the MLC, and more may follow before the tournament begins.\n\nFour out of the six teams in the MLC are owned by IPL team owners: Mumbai Indians, KKR, Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals."

        "body": "On the face of it, this should be a World Cup that suits South Asian teams. Pitches in the Caribbean have tended to be slow, in Guyana, Kingstown, and Antigua in particular.\n\nIf the trends seen in last year's Major League Cricket are any indication, surfaces in Dallas are likely to tend towards the slower side also. And in Lauderhill, Florida, only once has a team breached 190 in the six men's T20 Internationals played there this decade.\n\nBut this is a World Cup in which so little can be confidently predicted. So, few matches have been played in the three United States venues. Although drop-in pitches are being imported, and technically should play fairly evenly, there is no real telling how those tracks will fare in the particular climatic conditions that prevail in each of these venues, or how they will wear through the course of the tournament. New York is an especially tricky proposition. One month out, the stadium there is still being constructed.\n\nWith so much uncertainty about how the tournament will pan out, it could be the all-rounders in each squad that define teams' progress.\n\nWhen a side turns up at the ground and the track looks like there will be some seam early on [particularly in the morning matches, some of which start as early as 10:30am local time], captains would ideally like to have a high-quality seam-bowling all-rounder to boost the fast-bowling stocks, while compromising little in the way of batting.\n\nIf, mid-tournament, the pitches begin to change after several matches have been played on the same square, teams with spin-bowling all-rounders may find themselves in advantageous positions, in terms of picking their XI.\n\nMost South Asian sides have the spin-bowling all-rounder spot covered, of course. Bangladesh have Shakib Al Hasan, India have Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, Sri Lanka have Wanindu Hasaranga, Afghanistan have Rashid Khan, and Pakistan have Shadab Khan. So good is South Asia at producing spin bowlers that can bat, that all these players would likely make it into the team based only on their bowling.\n\nBut when it comes to seam-bowling all-rounders, South Asian sides tend not to have as high-quality a production line. Sri Lanka, for example, have Dasun Shanaka and Angelo Mathews in their squad. Both are batting all-rounders, and limited bowlers -- Mathews can be effective with the new ball when there is seam and swing on offer, but struggles in the middle overs, and cannot really bowl at the death except in extreme circumstances. Shanaka prefers bowling a quiet over in the middle, but has been in poor hitting form over the past year.\n\nIndia have Hardik Pandya, but he's coming off a rough IPL season, when for the first time in his career, he has faced the ire of India fans. Shivam Dube is also in the India squad, but at the international level, his bowling returns don't inspire a lot of confidence.\n\nPakistan are unlikely to pick any seam-bowling all-rounders. Afghanistan have the likes of Gulbadin Naib and Karim Janat. Again, these are players with only passable bowling statistics. Unlike the spinners, many of South Asia's seam-bowling all-rounders would not make the XI on one skill alone.\n\nUnusually for a World Cup year, there has also not been an Asia Cup. This year the IPL has imposed itself in the months leading up to the global tournament. Many have noted that the Impact Player rule in the IPL has seriously disadvantaged all-rounders. How India pivots back to a competition in which they cannot call on ultra-specialists to take care of specific passages in the game, remains to be seen.\n\nThe counter to this, of course, is that South Asia perhaps has the finest seam bowling cohort it has ever sent to a World Cup. Bangladesh have Mustafizur Rehman and Taskin Ahmed. Pakistan have Naseem Shah and Shaheen Afridi. Sri Lanka have their fastest seam-bowling battery ever -- Dushmantha Chameera, Dilshan Madushanka and Matheesha Pathirana all capable of breaching 145kph. India, of course, have the most valuable quick of them all, Jasprit Bumrah, as well as Mohammad Siraj, who is likely to prosper when movement is on offer.\n\nBut at a tournament that involves so much travel between time zones, such a diversity of venues, and a huge variety of teams, versatility is likely to be key. How well can you fine-tune your strategy for this particular match? All-rounders may be key to that.\n\nAndrew Fidel Fernando is a senior writer at ESPNcricinfo."

(Photo Source: MLC)\n\nAfter a very successful inaugural season in 2023, the organisers of Major League Cricket (MLC) are trying to make the second season bigger and better. They have received a major boost as the International Cricket Council (ICC) has given the league the coveted List A status.\n\nMLC becomes the second Associate-nation franchise tournament to gain List A status from ICC, after the UAE’s ILT20. The status means that the USA-based franchise tournament will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with tournament playing records now counted as official statistics of the shortest format of the game.\n\nAlso Read: MLC 2024: Los Angeles Knight Riders add Shakib Al Hasan to their roster\n\n“We are really excited for the news as it’s a recognition of the standard and high quality of players taking part in the tournament. By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale. The most important part for me though is it ensures the performances of some of the world’s best players alongside their peers are adequately reflected in their career statistics,” tournament director Justin Geale told ESPNcricinfo.\n\n“Really thankful to the ICC for taking the time to look at it as cricket in the USA doesn’t always fit into a template. We are an Associate nation and proud of that, one with a unique opportunity in front of us. It’s our hope that on the back of the upcoming World Cup and a successful season we can continue to build a platform for the sport to grow and ultimately succeed in the USA,” he added.\n\nThe highly-anticipated second season of MLC will start on July 5, a week after the T20 World Cup concludes on June 29. The T20 World Cup commences in Dallas, USA on June 1, in what is going to be a crucial season in the sport’s continuing efforts to attract the US audience.\n\nAlso Read: MLC, The Hundred overlap creates headache as committed players try to converge\n\nThe Guardian, which reported on the awarding of List A status on Monday, May 27, also revealed MLC’s plans to expand from the current six teams to 10 in the coming years. This will facilitate a leap from 19 games in 2023 to 34 by 2025. Meanwhile, 25 games have already been scheduled for the 2024 edition of the tournament."
