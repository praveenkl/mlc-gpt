        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) is proud to announce that the International Cricket Council (ICC) has granted it official List-A Status ahead of its highly anticipated second season, which commences July 5. 2024.\n\nThis significant development marks yet another crucial milestone in the growth and status of Major League Cricket, and cricket more broadly in the United States. It recognizes the Major League Cricket as an official T20 league and America’s ﬁrst world-class domestic tournament.\n\nNow, every century, half-century, 'ﬁve-for', run-out, win, loss, and championship will be documented as official career statistics in an internationally recognized format of the game. This will also provide local US players and upcoming stars of the game the opportunity for international recognition, furthering the development of domestic talent by the MLC.\n\nThe List-A Status comes after the MLC’s successful inaugural season and underscores its unwavering dedication to delivering premier cricket in the United States.\n\nIn addition to the official List-A status, MLC CEO, Vijay Srinivasan, recently announced aspirations to expand from what began as a 19-game season in 2023 to a 34-game season by 2025.\n\n“We saw cricket mania sweep across the US last year off the back of our inaugural season of Major League Cricket. Now, we take exciting momentum into the highly anticipated ICC T20 World Cup and season two of the MLC.\n\n“With an unforgettable summer of cricket on our doorstep, we’re ready to capture the hearts of American sports fans with our thrilling, adrenaline-charged game that is the most exciting emerging T20 tournament across the globe.”\n\nAfter sell-out crowds in the inaugural season, fans are encouraged to purchase their tickets early to ensure they don’t miss out on the action this season. In addition to the world-class matches, fans have several ticket options, with general admission tickets starting at $30 per person.\n\nThe season's excitement extends beyond the pitch, with entertainment, ﬁreworks, free giveaways, player signings and meet-and-greets, merchandise giveaways, food trucks, and samples throughout the tournament."

        "body": "Synopsis\n\nCricket returns to North America through the T20 World Cup, aiming to capture local interest despite limited awareness. With 30 million U.S. fans, the ICC sees potential. The event sets the stage for cricket's 2028 Olympic comeback. Major League Cricket's launch and strategic marketing aim to expand the sport's U.S. presence.\n\nCricket, a popular pastime in the United States in the mid 1800s, makes a big-ticket return to North American shores through the T20 Word Cup but will it be able to leave an impression on the local audience that knows little to nothing about the gentleman's game? Cricket globally is driven by India but the International Cricket Council sees huge potential in the American market and claims there are already 30 million fans that follow the game in the massive country.\n\nThe T20 showpiece is also seen as a major stepping stone to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make a comeback after 128 years when the big event kicks off on June 1.\n\nA total of 16 games will be played across three venues -- New York, Dallas and Lauderhill -- with a majority of 55 matches scheduled in the Caribbean including the knock-outs.\n\nDay three of the competition will have South Africa and Sri Lanka battling it out in New York, where the first ever international cricket game was held between USA and Canada back in 1844.\n\nIt was a phase when the sport was played widely across America before a much faster alternative in Baseball gained prominence during the Civil War in the 1860s.\n\n\"...(T20) it's entertainment and that's what people look for. That's what Americans look for, you know, they want entertainment,\" says legendary West Indian Brian Lara, one of the most recognisable cricketers in the world but someone who admits that he could walk around Miami without getting a second look.\n\n\"You know, you speak to an American and I've done that many times and they'd say 'you play a game for five days and then you end up in a draw? What's that all about?' So it's, it is difficult,\" he explains the challenge of selling Test cricket to an American, who might just warm up to the shortest format though.\n\nA couple of weeks of international cricket in an alien land will not be enough to evoke long-lasting interest from the local audience and to ensure the game grows beyond the South Asian and Caribbean expat community, the stakeholders will need more time.\n\nFor a beginner, cricket can be rather complex to understand especially when one is introduced to \"third man\", \"fine leg\" or \"deep mid-wicket\", some of the terms used for the many field placements in the game.\n\nThe ICC is pulling out all stops to engage with the American audience, whether it is getting eight-time Olympic gold-winning sprinter Usain Bolt on board as the World Cup ambassador or promoting the event at the recent Formula 1 race in Miami.\n\nTo distract the average American household from the world of baseball, NFL and NBA, cricket will need to grow at the grassroots level.\n\n\"I surely think the game can grow in the USA. When you have presence in a country people start gravitating towards it and want to know more about,\" Bolt, who belongs to the cricket-loving Caribbean, told PTI in a recent interview.\n\nThe Americans have surely one reason to follow the event. Their team, mainly made up of players from South Asian and Caribbean heritage, will be making its World Cup debut.\n\nVenu Pisike, head of USA Cricket, reckons the ICC event will bring much-needed awareness around the game but eventually, it is the lure of taking part in the 2028 Olympics that will draw masses to the sport.\n\n\"So far, cricket is predominantly an expats' game, but with the marketing and promotion activities during the World Cup, there is some momentum and the World Cup will definitely boost the opportunities to expand the game in the USA,\" said Pisike.\n\n\"Definitely, the World Cup is bringing a lot of awareness and then the opportunity for cricket to be in the Olympics, that will definitely attract the community because the US is a huge sports country.\n\n\"Olympics is the prime area where all the sports bodies are focusing on since cricket is going to Olympics, that will actually give more opportunities to expand the sport between the World Cup and the Olympics,\" added Pisike.\n\nThe USA squad picked for the tournament makes up for a bunch of semi-professionals who rely on full-time jobs to run their families. That will have to change if the sport is to appeal to a broader audience in America, believes India-born USA squad member Nisarg Patel.\n\n\"Ultimately what needs to change in the USA is that an American kid in a high school needs to see a future in the game. There are so many sports in America, the country is built on Olympic medals.\n\n\"For cricket to succeed, we need to show them there is a career out of playing cricket,\" said the spinner, who works full-time with a medical research company in Los Angeles.\n\nThe start of Major League Cricket last year, the sport's first professional league in the country, was a big step in that direction.\n\nHowever, to capture the imagination of people in a country with an already crowded and developed sporting landscape, would be a gargantuan challenge for the ICC and other stakeholders.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nInternal tussle over audit red flags?

        "date": "Tue May 28 15:00:44 2024",
        "body": "Major League Cricket Gains List A Status from ICC\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) in the United States has taken a significant step forward by acquiring List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) ahead of its second season. This recognition places MLC alongside other official T20 leagues, affirming the quality and competitiveness of the tournament.\n\nEnhancing the Credibility of American Cricket\n\nJustin Geale, the tournament director, expressed his excitement about this development, noting that it acknowledges the high standard of players participating in the league. “By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale,” Geale told ESPNcricinfo.\n\nGeale emphasised the importance of this status for the players’ career statistics, ensuring their performances are officially recorded. This milestone is crucial for cricket’s growth in the US, an Associate nation with a unique opportunity to build a robust cricketing culture. Geale added, “It’s our hope that on the back of the upcoming World Cup and a successful season we can continue to build a platform for the sport to grow and ultimately succeed in the USA.”\n\nUpcoming Season and Expansion Plans\n\nThe 2024 edition of MLC is scheduled to begin on July 5, shortly after the T20 World Cup concludes on June 29 in Bridgetown. The T20 World Cup itself starts in Dallas, USA, on June 1, marking a pivotal season in efforts to popularise cricket in the US market.\n\nMLC’s plans for expansion are ambitious, with a vision to grow from the current six teams to 10 over the next few years. The number of games will also increase significantly, jumping from 19 matches in 2023 to 34 by 2025. Vijay Srinivasan, MLC’s chief executive, outlined this growth strategy to The Guardian, stating, “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan.”\n\nScheduling and Global Cricket Calendar\n\nThe league’s scheduling is strategic, aiming to find an optimal window in the crowded global cricket calendar. Srinivasan explained that the ideal start would be in early June, aligning with the end of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the start of school holidays in the US. This timing would avoid clashes with other major leagues like the Hundred and the T20 Blast.\n\nThis year, MLC will overlap with the Hundred by six days, with MLC concluding on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. This overlap means that several overseas players contracted to the Hundred might join their teams late. Currently, 12 out of the 24 overseas players in the Hundred have commitments in MLC, indicating a significant crossover of talent.\n\nOwnership and Infrastructure\n\nFour of the six teams in MLC are owned by IPL franchises – Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals. This association with established IPL teams has helped MLC attract high-calibre players and gain credibility.\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC ran from July 13 to 31, featuring 15 group-stage matches followed by four playoff games. MI New York emerged victorious, led by captain Nicholas Pooran. The second season will be hosted at the same venues as the first: Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.\n\nFuture Prospects for MLC\n\nThe official List A status and the planned expansion underscore the growing importance of MLC in the global cricket landscape. The league’s success could play a pivotal role in embedding cricket into the American sporting culture. With strategic planning and support from major cricketing bodies and franchises, MLC has the potential to become a significant player on the international stage.\n\nAs the league prepares for its second season, the anticipation is high. The players, teams, and fans are eager to see how MLC will continue to evolve and impact the sport globally. The future looks promising for Major League Cricket, and its journey will be closely watched by cricket enthusiasts around the world."

        "body": "In a major boost to America’s premier T20 tournament, Major League Cricket has officially been given the List A status by the International Cricket Council. Started in June last year MLC has played a vital role in promoting the game of cricket in the United States which is evident by the fact that the tournament was able to grasp the attention of the audience in a country like India which is said to have one of the biggest consumer base of cricket in the world. Despite the odd time at which the matches were being televised and streamed the T20 league was watched by the cricket-loving nation.\n\nWhat They Said?\n\nIn the words of tournament director Justin Geale “By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Success\n\nAnother reason for the tournament’ssuccess was the involvement of big players gelled with talented local players like USA’s national team captain Monak Patel, and Aaron Jones former Indian all-rounder Harmeet Singh to name some. If we talk about experienced players it includes the likes of Kieron Pollard, Sunil Narine, and Andre Russell all of whom have made a name for themselves in T20 leagues around the world.\n\nAlso Read: Star Batters Quinton De Kock And Heinrich Klaasen Stay With Seattle Orcas For MLC 2024\n\nThe Impact\n\nThe MLC has made a huge impact on the performance of the national team as well which was on show during USA’s first-ever series win against a Test-playing nation as the Monak Patel-led side beat Bangladesh by the margin of 2-1 in the three-match T20 series. This was USA’s second series win on the trott having defeated Canada 4-0 in the previous series.\n\nAlso Read: MLC Franchises Pick One Domestic Player Each Through A Wildcard Draft\n\nThe Start\n\nThe second season of the Major League Cricket will begin from July 5 2024 which is a few days after the conclusion of the 2024 T20 World Cup scheduled to be held in the West Indies and USA from June 1 to June 30 a tournament which can be a stepping stone in ICC’s bid to promote cricket in the US as it is one of the biggest market after India as far as the value of the media broadcasting rights are concerned. USA will kick off their T20 World Cup campaign with the opening match of the tournament against Canada on June 1.\n\nThe Timing\n\nOne of the reasons why the league is starting in early July is to avoid the clash with England’s new competition The Hunfred. If we talk about last year’s scenario in 2023 the league ended just two days prior to the start of the Hundred which resulted in a jam-packed schedule for the players that participated in both leagues as they had to travel from one continent to another in a short span of time."
