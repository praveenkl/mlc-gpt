        "date": "Thu May 25 16:37:09 2023",
        "body": "Jason Roy has given up his England contract in order to play in this summer’s first edition of Major League Cricket.\n\nRoy made a request to the ECB to be released to play in the US franchise tournament, which England have granted on the condition that the World Cup-winning opener relinquish the remainder of his incremental deal.\n\nThe 32-year-old will not miss any England matches in order to play in the tournament, with Jos Buttler’s side not in white-ball action this summer until late-August, but under the terms of their contract the ECB could have asked him to rest during the gap between the Vitality Blast and Hundred. Roy’s decision will not effect his future selection prospects, with the batter still England’s incumbent opener in ODI cricket ahead of their World Cup defence in India this autumn.\n\nIn a statement, Roy insisted representing England remained his chief priority.\n\n“I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will ‘walk away from England’,” Roy said. “Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer. I hope to play for England for many more years.”\n\nRoy is set to become the first English player to sign up to the new competition, which takes place in Texas during the final two weeks of July, with reports suggesting he is likely to turn out for the LA Knight Riders, one of six newly-formed teams, four of which are at least partially backed by IPL owners.\n\nRoy has just returned from a stint with Kolkata Knight Riders at the IPL and is set to make his first Surrey appearance of the season in Thursday’s Blast opener against Middlesex at Lord’s.\n\nIt is understood that Roy will still be available for the entirety of Surrey’s Blast campaign, including Finals Day on July 15 should the county get that far, before flying to the US and then returning in time to play for Oval Invincibles in the Hundred.\n\nRoy was demoted to an incremental deal last October, having been dropped by England’s T20 side ahead of their successful World Cup campaign, and will now forgo the remainder of his salary up until the contract was due to expire at the end of September.\n\nIncremental contracts are worth between £60,000 and £70,000 a year and Roy could earn more than twice that amount for just two weeks’ work in the US."

        "date": "Sun Jul 16 02:52:34 2023",
        "body": "Z is for Zampa. Z is also for zany. Australian cricket star Adam Zampa has attracted instant headlines for America’s fledgling Major League Cricket competition - and it had nothing to do with what he did with bat or ball.\n\nThe extroverted Aussie leg spinner instead caused a storm with his choice of number on the back of his LA Knight Riders’ playing shirt. Zampa opted for number 420 - presumably as a reference to marijuana - for the match against the Texas Super Kings.\n\n'SURPRISED': Alex Carey's telling response to Jonny Bairstow Ashes outrage\n\nCLASSIC: Mitchell Starc's hilarious Alyssa Healy reveal amid Ashes battle\n\nHUGE: Michael Neser puts Ashes selectors on notice in astonishing feat\n\nThe origins of 420 are a little murky, with one suggestion it was the police radio call used for any dope related offence in the US. Another explanation is it’s the room number the Grateful Dead insisted on staying in during their touring days.\n\nA more plausible reason is it’s the codename a bunch of schoolboys gave their group in 1971 after discovering a marijuana crop in San Francisco. The boys would meet after school at 4:20pm, hence the tag.\n\nEvery year around the world, marijuana enthusiasts meet on April 20 (4/20 on the American calendar) to celebrate their love of weed and push for its decriminalisation. Zampa has not publicly declared why he chose shirt number 420 but fans have decided it’s his way of bringing a bit of life and colour to the American tournament.\n\nAdam Zampa shirt number takes internet by storm\n\nIt certainly became a major talking point. Fans from around the cricket world took to social media to speculate about Zampa’s motives for using 420.\n\nAdam Zampa remains one of cricket's quirkiest characters\n\nThe 31-year-old has long done things his way, refusing to conform to cricket’s straight-laced ways. He lives on a farm on the NSW far north coast - away from the major cricketing centres - and long ago adopted a vegan diet.\n\nHe is passionate about environmental and social issues and a keen advocate for animal welfare. Now it appears he is lending his support to another popular cause.\n\nZampa’s LA Knight Riders are co-owned by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and boast premier West Indian players Sunil Narime, Andre Russell, South African Rilee Rossouw and New Zealander Lockie Ferguson among their playing ranks."

        "title": "Zampa admits not getting the same buzz from franchise cricket",
        "date": "Sun May 26 09:49:19 2024",
        "body": "Adam Zampa, the T20I and ODI World Cup-winning leg spinner, has admitted that he doesn’t get the “same buzz” as international cricket while practising his trade in franchise cricket.\n\nZampa was quite active in franchise cricket leagues in 2023; however, that was to get him fully prepared and in the groove for the ODI World Cup in India. Apart from playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Rajasthan Royals (he picked eight wickets in six games), Zampa also played in the Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States of America and the Hundred in England.\n\nZampa was due to return to the Royals camp in 2024 but withdrew from the competition to spend more time with his family at home. The leggie felt that doing so would also allow him to extend his career for Australia and play as long as he could.\n\n“There’s always a lot of chat about ‘can you play franchise cricket all year round’, and it was something I had thought about – at what age do I get through to try to play a bit of franchise cricket then,” Zampa told The Age.\n\n“But after 2023 and winning the World Cup and all that, and having a young family now as well, I’ve realised I want to play cricket for as long as I can, and instead of trying to play for nine or 10 months of the year, it’s played for six or seven.”\n\nZampa also admitted that the great environment provided by head coach Andrew McDonald and skipper Pat Cummins makes him enjoy his cricket. Moreover, his contract with Cricket Australia has allowed him the freedom to opt out of lucrative T20 league stints.\n\n“I’ve really come to love playing for Australia. I always loved it, but playing under Dan Vettori, Andrew McDonald and Pat and Mitch as captains, it is just so enjoyable. I make good money playing for Australia and I would love to prioritise playing for Australia and being with my family,” Zampa said.\n\n“I don’t get enough out of franchise cricket. It’s great for certain aspects of your life, and it can be really enjoyable, but it’s not like being in the Aussie dressing room, not for me anyway. I don’t get the same buzz out of it.”\n\nZampa also accepted that if he had played the IPL, he would have “dreaded” going to the World Cup because of the short turnaround time between the two tournaments. The three-month break before the World Cup has not only rejuvenated the leggie but also allowed him time to spend with his wife and kid.\n\n“The last three months have probably been the best three months of my life. I think if I’d gone to the IPL and I was home now for a few days I think I’d be really dreading going,” Zampa said honestly.\n\n“I haven’t had a break like this since my son was born, and that’s different to what I’ve had now. It gives me a bit of an idea of what life could look like after cricket, and it does excite me. But still a long way away, I think.”\n\nAustralia begin their World Cup journey against Oman on June 6."

        "date": "Sun May 26 17:25:15 2024",
        "body": "On the 2nd of April, 2024, Cognizant Major League Cricket announced that they would be partnering with Stake.com for the MLC 2024 season.\n\nThe social casino, online gaming and sports betting brand is now the official sponsor for the American T20 League. They’ve signed a multi-year deal to support the MLC’s second season this summer.\n\nFor cricket fans in the United States and around the globe, this new strategic partnership is great news. With a strong financial backer supporting the league so early on in it’s history, there’s no doubt that the viewing experience for both casual fans and dedicated bettors will be greatly boosted.\n\nA summer of cricket with Stake.com\n\nWhen asked for comment on the partnership, Stake’s Chief Marketing Officer stated, “We thoroughly enjoyed MLC’s inaugural season in 2023 and jumped at the chance to become an Official Partner for 2024 and beyond. With the T20 World Cup taking place on US soil later in the year, we see this as a breakout year for cricket in the US and can’t wait to be a part of it.”\n\nThe partnership will allow Stake to be among the first betting platforms in line to connect with a passionate and rapidly growing American fanbase.\n\nAs for the fans, they can expect to see splashes of the brand’s logo throughout coverage for the season, which will officially begin on the 4th of July, just 4 days after the 2024 T20 World Cup wraps up. Along with prominent branding, fans may also look forward to participating in a number sponsored contests throughout the season.\n\nStake.com is also proud to be holding a prestigious honor this year at the league’s final. They are sponsoring the MVP of the Tournament award for the season’s top performing player. According to the official press release, this will add some needed recognition and weight to this already coveted award.\n\nLast year’s MVP winner was Nicholas Pooran due to his spectacular display of athleticism in last year’s explosive championship final. After South African cricketer Aiden Markram’s incredible catch earlier this year, it’s clear that 2024 is gearing up to be an exceptional year for cricket excellence, even more so now that Stake.com has entered the fold.\n\nWhat does this mean for bettors?\n\nThe partnership will likely be a cause for celebration among betting fans. The brand already has a great track record when it comes to growing and elevating sporting fan communities. MLC’s co-founder backs up this claim. In a statement, Srinivasan mentioned that he believes the partnership will bring the growth American cricket needs to flourish for many years to come.\n\nThe brains behind the MLC believe that, with Stake.com as a partner, the continued growth of the league is in good hands. In a statement, MLC’s co-founder Vijay Srinivasan said, “We’re excited to be partnering with a renowned company that supports many global sports properties.”\n\nIf fans of the MLC aren’t already familiar with Stake’s offering, now would be a great time to look into what the platform has in store for cricket and other sporting events this year. Not only is the platform highly regarded by seasoned bettors, newcomers can use the following promo code for Stake.com to effectively triple an initial deposit and get started placing wagers with the casino operator.\n\nWith the MLC tournament still a few weeks away, it will quickly become clear what other benefit Stake’s bettor’s can expect to see. Based on previous sponsorships, there’s a good chance bettors might see expanded betting options for MLC matches. There also might be other exclusive promotions on offer closer to the event.\n\nCasual fans might want to look into Stake’s platform too, even if betting isn’t their style. The site will no doubt offer some form of educational resources for people to learn more about the league and it’s players along with live statistic feeds for cricket fans who love to get stuck into extra facts and figures.\n\nThis isn’t Stake’s first rodeo\n\nWith the MLC partnership secured, Stake.com is expanding its already surprisingly extensive sports sponsorship portfolio. Most notably, the brand has previously become a title sponsor for a Formula One team and secured sponsorship deals with the UFC and Everton FC.\n\nThe brand has enjoyed a meteoric rise due, in part, by partnering with major sporting events. In just three short years, the previously unknown betting platform has processed an absolutely mind-blowing 45 billion sports gaming bets. The reasons behind this success has everything to do with Stake’s commitment to favorable odds, instant withdrawals and immensely thrilling promotions.\n\nThere’s little to no doubt that the timing of this MLC partnership is no accident. Stake.com appears to recognize the immense potential of American cricket, especially with the T20 World Cup also set to take place in the United States later this year. If cricket can become a major sport in the country with the same level of prestige as Major League Basketball or the NFL, this would open up a lucrative new betting market.\n\nWhen the season officially gets underway this July, there’s a good chance that the already exciting sport that is T20 Cricket will be even more action packed than ever. With Stake’s expertise guiding community building and facilitating safe and transparent betting, fans of all shapes and sizes will be in for a real cricket-themed treat."
