The Hundred's group stage starts on July 23 while MLC will run until the final on July 28, with the knockout fixtures - which will feature four of the six franchises - starting July 24.\n\nTwelve out of the 24 overseas players under contract in the men's Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in MLC and more could follow before the tournament starts on July 5. The vast majority of them will stay in the US until their respective franchises are eliminated.\n\nRelated\n\n'It's not rocket science' - CPL's CEO asks T20 leagues to collaborate on scheduling\n\nMLC: Rashid, Pooran, Boult, Rauf among overseas players retained\n\nTravis Head joins Steven Smith at Washington Freedom for MLC 2024\n\nTexas Super Kings snap up Mitchell for MLC 2024, Shepherd goes to MI New York\n\nESPNcricinfo understands that Stephen Fleming is likely to buck the trend by prioritising the Hundred. Fleming, who is in India with Chennai Super Kings, coaches Texas Super Kings in MLC but his Hundred team, Southern Brave, have received assurances that he will arrive in the UK before their opening fixture on July 24. Fleming did not respond when contacted.\n\nDepending on which MLC franchises reach the playoffs, some Hundred teams could be without two or even three overseas players for their opening fixture. Fleming's Brave, for example, could be missing Kieron Pollard (MI New York), Akeal Hosein (Washington Freedom) and Finn Allen (San Francisco Unicorns) for their first match.\n\nPlayer wages in MLC were higher than in the men's Hundred last year. The top salary in MLC was around US$175,000 (£135,000 approx.) for a minimum of five games across two-and-a-half weeks; in the men's Hundred, the top salary was £125,000 (US$155,000 approx.) for a minimum of eight games across four weeks.\n\nThe men's Hundred is likely to be short on star power for the opening week, also clashing with the third England vs West Indies Test at Edgbaston which runs from July 26-30. Availability is much better in the women's Hundred, where the only relevant clash is a brief overlap with the Asia Cup.\n\nMLC will start on July 5 - a day later than initially planned - and the 21-match group stage will run until July 23. Each team will play seven group fixtures. The four knockout fixtures have been scheduled for July 24 (Eliminator), 25 (Qualifier), 26 (Challenger) and 28 (final). As well as the Hundred, it will directly clash with the Lanka Premier League which is due to run July 1-21.\n\nLike last year, two venues will be used: Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. The ICC said earlier this year that MLC were evaluating the possibility of using the 'modular' stadium in Eisenhower Park, near New York - which will host eight T20 World Cup matches in June - but those plans have been shelved.\n\nMLC has proved particularly attractive to Australian players this year, with Steven Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell and Jake Fraser-McGurk all due to feature. Two MLC franchises have links with Australian states - Washington Freedom (New South Wales) and San Francisco Unicorns (Victorians) - while a Seattle Orcas squad recently toured Queensland.\n\nA desire to attract the best overseas players in the world is among several reasons underpinning the ECB's plan to sell equity stakes in Hundred teams to private investors later this year. Richard Gould, the ECB's chief executive, said last month that there is a \"strong consensus that we would like to see private investment come into the Hundred\".\n\nThe ECB have been meeting counties regularly and hope they will agree on a direction of travel this week. Under their latest proposals, they would gift a 51% share in each Hundred team to its host county (or MCC, in the case of London Spirit) and would sell the other 49% itself by the end of the year, sharing the revenue generated across the English game.\n\n\"Who gets what within that 49%? That's where the conversation will be over the next couple of weeks,\" Stuart Cain, Warwickshire's chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra last week. \"What's the best way to spread that money around the 18 counties - if you include the MCC, 19 - to try and create a more sustainable, vibrant foundation for the county system?\"\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98"

They will lock horns with the Seattle Orcas, led by the dynamic South African duo of Wayne Parnell and Quinton de Kock.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings, spearheaded by South African Faf du Plessis, will take on West Indian Sunil Narine's LA Knight Riders at the purpose-built Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, later in the evening.\n\nThe opening weekend will also feature the Australians-stacked Washington Freedom featuring Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and coach Ricky Ponting, facing MI New York on July 6. The San Francisco Unicorns, bolstered by hard-hitting opening New Zealand batter Finn Allen, will host the LA Knight Riders on July 7 at Grand Prairie Stadium, TX.\n\nThe Major League Cricket's CEO, Vijay Srinivasan, said he can't wait to see the passion and enthusiasm come to life with cricket fans across the country for the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\n\"We are incredibly excited to unveil the schedule for the 2024 season,\" said Srinivasan.\n\n\"This promises to be our most thrilling season yet, with each of the MLC's six teams actively recruiting in the off-season, adding a host of world-class player signings to their team rosters with more big names to be soon announced.\"\n\nWith some of world cricket's biggest current stars and seasoned veterans involved, including the likes of athletic Jamaican allrounder Andre Russell, New Zealand's left-arm quick, Trent Boult, 2023 MLC Finals MVP Nicholas Pooran, Afghanistan's superstar spinner, Rashid Khan, together with cricketing royalty in coaches Ricky Ponting, Shane Watson and Stephen Fleming, it demonstrates the depth of talent being attracted to the league,\" he added.\n\nIn addition to the highly-anticipated matches, MLC remains committed to supporting the long-term infrastructure to foster the growth of local cricket communities further while strengthening cricket's presence in the US.\"\n\nLast year, we unveiled MLC at the newly upgraded Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, and the brand new Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, which will both once again co-host the 2024 tournament, building on the impact of season one in those communities,\" Srinivasan said.\"\n\nThese venues will deliver world-class pitches and a vibrant atmosphere to support the overall MLC fan experience. Moreover, we are committed to exploring expansion opportunities with new cricket venues to support our six teams' growing American fanbase,\" he said."
