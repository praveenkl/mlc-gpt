        "title": "Anticipation In America Building For Major League Cricket’s Second Season",
        "date": "Sat May 18 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Anticipation is building for the second season of Major League Cricket as the lucrative American professional T20 competition aims to build on a successful debut.\n\nThe upcoming season starts on July 5 with a double header between defending champions MI New York and Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season's final at Morrisville, North Carolina, while Texas Super Kings plays LA Knight Riders in the later fixture in Dallas.\n\nThe final will be played on July 27, with the latter parts of the tournament clashing with the Hundred, the high-profile 100-ball competition in England.\n\nAs I reported recently, MLC officials want the tournament to be held annually from mid-June to mid-July to avoid clashes, but this year was not possible due to the T20 World Cup - co-hosted by the U.S - only finishing in late June.\n\nThe MLC hierarchy are bullish that momentum from a historic T20 World Cup, with games played in New York, Dallas and Florida, can spill over after pre-sale tickets have been in \"high demand\" since the season's schedule was unveiled.\n\nStandard tickets start at $30. “The enthusiasm for cricket in America is increasing rapidly, and we are delighted to provide fans across the nation the opportunity to witness top-tier cricket live in their own backyard,\" MLC chief executive Vijay Srinivasan said.\n\n\"The success of the first season has given us a foundation to establish one of the premier T20 leagues in the world.\n\n\"Our goal is to keep expanding the sport in the United States and offer the community an opportunity to engage with it, whether as fans or participants.\"\n\nAttendances last season were strong with around 70,000 fans turning out to the 18-day tournament played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the more modest Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nThe second season will expand by six games with teams to play seven matches in the group stages ahead of four playoff games. MLC officials and owners want a home-and-away season - where the teams play each other twice - to underpin the competition, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds.\n\nAs I reported previously, salary caps will not increase but player wages will remain in the top echelons of T20 professional leagues. Top players will still be well remunerated and earn $175,000 for a minimum of five games - rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nMLC has benefited from powerhouse Australia having no international commitments after the T20 World Cup. It has led to a barrage of marquee Australian signings, including legendary Steve Smith, emerging star batter Jake Fraser-McGurk and last year's World Cup heroes Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head.\n\nAs I first reported, MLC exceeded financial targets in its debut season with revenues of $8 million.\n\nUndoubtedly the novelty factor helped its long-awaited launch. But, as excitement continues to build, there is growing optimism that MLC will be even more successful on-and-off the field in its second season."
