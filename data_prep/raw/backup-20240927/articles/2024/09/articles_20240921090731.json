        "body": "Major League Cricket to tempt England great Anderson with six-figure offer\n\nEngland’s greatest ever bowler James Anderson could make a comeback in Major League Cricket after attracting interest from US franchises.\n\nAnderson was ushered into international retirement by England chiefs earlier this summer but is considering prolonging his career by playing lucrative white-ball competitions.\n\nThe 42-year-old seamer, England’s all-time record wicket-taker in Test cricket, could earn £130,000 from a stint in Major League Cricket.\n\nThe six-team competition completed its second season in July and featured international stars such as Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, Trent Boult, Travis Head and Faf du Plessis.\n\nOwners of Major League Cricket franchises include the proprietors of Indian Premier League sides Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings.\n\nAt least one team is reported by the BBC to have been alerted to Anderson’s potential availability by comments he made last month following his international retirement.\n\n“I might be in a bit of denial because I’m well aware I won’t play for England again, but I’ve still not made a decision on my actual cricket career,” he said.\n\n“There’s definitely a bit of intrigue with the shorter formats because I’ve not played any franchise stuff before. Watching The Hundred this year, seeing the ball swing around, it makes me feel like I could do a job there.\n\n“I know it’s a while since I played it and my age will get brought up again but I really feel I’ll be good enough to play that form of cricket.”\n\nAnderson took 18 wickets in 19 T20 appearances for England, as well as 269 in 194 one-day internationals.\n\nHis 704 wickets in 188 Tests is a record for an England player and behind only Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan and Aussie great Shane Warne in the all-time list.\n\nHe is currently part of the England coaching team and is expected to travel to Pakistan next month and New Zealand in December as a fast-bowling mentor."

        "body": "England's leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson has come out as a surprise target for USA's Major League Cricket, BBC Sport reported on Monday.\n\nAccording to the report, senior figures from at least one MLC team have taken interest in Anderson's comments last month regarding a possible return to white-ball cricket.\n\nThe unnamed franchise is now set to investigate whether the 42-year-old would be open to participating in the third edition of the T20 tournament in the United States next year.\n\nAnderson could earn approximately £135,000 for a short stint in MLC, which attracted several high-profile players for the 2024 edition.\n\nThe most notable of those was Australia’s captain, Pat Cummins, who has a lucrative contract with the San Francisco Unicorns until 2027.\n\nFellow Australians Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head were all part of the star-studded Washington Freedom team, coached by Ricky Ponting, which won this year’s tournament.\n\nAnderson, who concluded his international career with 704 Test wickets, retired from international cricket following the first Test against the West Indies at Lord's in July.\n\nHe immediately joined England’s backroom staff and remains on a central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) until the end of September.\n\nLast week, Anderson confirmed that he would continue in his role as a fast-bowling mentor for England’s Test series against Pakistan in October, and plans to join the side for their tour of New Zealand in December.\n\nAnderson's last competitive T20 match was in 2014 when he played in the Blast for Lancashire.\n\nHis decision to focus the last decade of his career on red-ball cricket means he has never played franchise cricket overseas, though he believes he is \"fit enough\" and \"good enough\" to play the format.\n\nEngland World Cup winners Liam Plunkett and Jason Roy have both participated in the previous two editions of MLC.\n\nIn May 2023, Roy relinquished his ECB white-ball contract, worth up to £70,000, to sign a two-year deal with the Los Angeles Knight Riders worth £300,000.\n\nMLC, which launched in 2023 with a 19-game season, will expand to 34 games in 2025. The tournament was granted official List A status in May."
