        "body": "England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson is a surprise target for Major League Cricket.\n\nBBC Sport understands senior figures with at least one MLC team have had their interest pricked by Anderson's comments last month about a return to white-ball cricket.\n\nThe unnamed franchise are now set to explore whether the 42-year-old would be interested in participating in the third edition of the T20 tournament in the United States next year.\n\nAnderson could earn about £135,000 from a short stint in MLC, which lured some stellar names from the game for the 2024 edition.\n\nThe most high profile of those was Australia captain Pat Cummins, who has a lucrative contract with the San Francisco Unicorns until 2027.\n\nFellow Australians Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head were all part of the star-studded Washington Freedom team, coached by Ricky Ponting, which won this year's tournament.\n\nAnderson, who finished with 704 Test wickets, retired from international cricket following the first Test against West Indies at Lord's in July.\n\nHe immediately joined the England backroom team and remains on a central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) until the end of September.\n\nAnderson said last week he would continue in his role as a fast-bowling mentor for England's Test series against Pakistan in October and was planning to join the side for their tour of New Zealand in December.\n\nBrook to captain England in ODIs with Buttler out\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\nIreland claim first T20 win over England to draw series\n\nAnderson's last competitive T20 match was in 2014, when he played in the Blast for Lancashire.\n\nHis decision to dedicate the last 10 years of his career to red-ball cricket means he has never played franchise cricket overseas but he believes he is \"fit enough\" and \"good enough\" to play the format.\n\nThe league, which has influential backers including Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, has expressed a desire to lure some of England's top players to the competition.\n\nEngland World Cup winners Liam Plunkett and Jason Roy have both taken part in the past two versions of MLC.\n\nIn May 2023, Roy gave up his ECB white-ball contract worth up to £70,000 to sign a two-year deal with the Los Angeles Knight Riders worth £300,000.\n\nMLC launched in 2023 with a 19-game season but will expand to 34 games in 2025. The tournament was granted official List A status in May."

        "body": "Earlier this year Ponting had parted ways Delhi Capitals. After leaving Delhi Capitals Ponting guided Washington Freedom to its first Major League Cricket win.\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nIndian Premier League (IPL) franchisee Punjab Kings (PBKS) have appointed Ricky Ponting as its new head coach. Ponting had parted ways with Delhi Capitals at the end of the 2024 season of the IPL.\n\nAccording to ESPNCRICINFO former Australian captain has signed a multi-year deal with PBKS.\n\nBefore serving as the head coach of Delhi Capitals, Pointing had worked with Mumbai Indians in the same capacity from 2014 to 2016. Earlier this year Ponting also made his foray into Major League Cricket (MLC) as he was chosen as the head coach of Washington Freedom. With Ponting as the coach, Washington Freedom won its first MLC title losing just one game in MLC 2024.\n\nLast season Punjab was coached by Trevor Bayliss. The team had a disappointing run as it finished ninth in the ten-team tournament. Ponting will be PBKS' sixth head coach in seven years.\n\nKings have had a disappointing run in the last 10 years as it has failed to qualify for the play-off even once in this span. In 2014 the team under the leadership of former Australian player George Bailey qualified for the final but it lost the title match to Kolkata Knight Riders. In last six seasons the team have failed to finish above fifth position on the IPL points tally.\n\nWith Shikhar Dhawan announcing his retirement from cricket last month, Punjab will be heading into IPL 2025 with a new captain-coach duo at the helm of affairs."

        "date": "Wed Sep 18 14:02:22 2024",
        "body": "On September 18 (Wednesday), Punjab Kings announced that the 49-year-old Australian Ricky Ponting will replace fellow Australian Trevor Bayliss as their new head coach for the upcoming season.\n\nOne thing that Ponting’s tenure at Delhi Capitals resulted in was a large number of Australian cricketers in the squad. This was seen during the 2024 edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC), Washington Freedom, where he said as many as four Australian cricketers.\n\nIf the trend has to follow, these are the Australian players that Ponting could target for Punjab Kings at the 2025 IPL Auction.\n\nTim David\n\nPonting’s connection with the Hobart Hurricanes is quite strong, and hence, Tim David could very well be targeted by the Punjab Kings. David could fit into the Kings’ system like a glove, with his ability to clear the fence with ease.\n\n\"If I was a selector, I would love to have someone like that [David] in my team. He's the sort of player that could actually win you a World Cup,\" Ponting had praised David endlessly.\n\nWhile David’s numbers might be nosediving, you can be rest assured that someone like Ponting would be eyeing to resurrect his career.\n\nTravis Head\n\nWhile it might come in as unlikely news, there’s still a slim chance that SRH might retain Pat Cummins and Heinrich Klaasen ahead of Travis Head. That essentially gives the Kings an outside chance of snapping the all-rounder.\n\nAlso Read: Travis Head’s 2024: the best ever by an Aussie & among the greatest in T20I history\n\nHead has dominated 2024 like no one else has, and that could be enough for PBKS to go hard for the all-rounder. Consider this as well - it could even be a realistic possibility that PBKS could afford Head, considering how much money they would save out of retaining very few players.\n\nSteve Smith\n\nWhaattt? It is an all-time low even for Punjab Kings, you might wonder. But here’s the catch. The right-hander amassed 336 runs in just nine appearances for the Washington Freedom while scoring at a strike rate of 148.67.\n\nPrior to that, Smith also had a stellar 2022/23 season, during which he scored 346 runs with a strike rate of 174.74. Given his great captaincy options, Punjab Kings might definitely be interested in getting him on board.\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nThere’s a really good chance that RCB might let go of Glenn Maxwell, their favourite overseas child after AB de Villiers in recent years. Maxwell hasn’t been in the best of form, with 52 runs, averaging just 5.77!!!\n\nHe might have played for Punjab Kings before, but he could be a force if he reunites with Ponting, whom he coached at the Freedom setup.\n\nNikhil Chaudhary\n\nPunjab Kings and swashbuckling all-rounders? That’s a perfect match. That’s where Nikhil Chaudhary could come in handy for the Kings. The 28-year-old showed his prowess in his maiden Big Bash League season, where he struck at 142.59.\n\nAdd in the Punjab factor, indeed a homecoming could be around the corner for Nikhil, considering both the franchise and the Ponting factor.\n\nPatrick Dooley\n\nThe windmill - that’s what people in Australia call the left-arm wrist spinner Patrick Dooley.\n\nOver the last two years, he’s absolutely mesmerized every batter in the competition with his quirky action that has mimicked the Indian pacer, Jasprit Bumrah. The 27-year-old could be an X-factor option for Punjab Kings.\n\nThe left-arm spinner has already picked up 25 wickets, averaging 21.60, including a four-wicket haul. Given how much Ponting rates him, don’t be surprised if PBKS might pick Dooley.\n\nMitchell Marsh\n\nShocking, right? Delhi Capitals might not retain the Australian captain. That’s where Punjab Kings might swoop in and take away the all-rounder from beneath everyone’s noses at the IPL Auction.\n\n“Talking about (captaincy) he's [Marsh] a rookie, but captaincy sits well with him,\" Ponting told ICC. That’s where Punjab could benefit from having Marsh as a captain as well. They have to build a future, and it could start with getting the Australian captain on board."
