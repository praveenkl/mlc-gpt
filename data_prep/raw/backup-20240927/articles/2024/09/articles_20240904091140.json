        "body": "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has refused to issue a No Objection Letter (NOC) to national fast bowler Haris Rauf for the Big Bash League (BBL) in Australia.\n\nThe fast bowler had requested a special NOC for the Big Bash League from the PCB, but the board rejected his request.\n\nPCB responded that he has played in two leagues, Major League Cricket (MLC) and The Hundred, so NOC cannot be given now. The Melbourne Stars and Sydney Thunders were keen to sign him in BBL.\n\nPCB did not issue NOCs to other cricketers, including Babar Azam and Saim Ayub, due to the Champions Cup. However, PCB issued NOCs to Usama Mir for Big Bash."
