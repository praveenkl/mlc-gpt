        "body": "The most ambitious attempt yet to establish professional cricket in the United States gets under way on Wednesday when wickets will be pitched for the start of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket.\n\nWith backing from four franchises in the Indian Premier League, including the league's most successful teams the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings, MLC has plenty of money and expertise behind it, unlike prior attempts to crack the American market.\n\nAs well as financial muscle and television deals, MLC has also been sanctioned by USA Cricket and the International Cricket Council -- rubber stamps that have been absent from short-lived private ventures in the past.\n\nLike the IPL, the league will play the shortest and most explosive version of cricket, Twenty20, and has recruited some experienced international players.\n\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\n\nWhile cricket has long been played at a recreational level in the USA -- the first-ever international game being between the USA and Canada at New York in 1844 -- there remains a shortage of facilities for the sport in a country where baseball is beloved.\n\nA former baseball park in North Texas, Grand Prairie Stadium, has been transformed into a cricket-specific venue and will be the site of the opener when the Texas Super Kings face the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\n\nWhile organizers expect good levels of support from fans with family backgrounds in cricket-loving countries, they aim to gradually win over the broader American public.\n\n\"The goal is to grow the game of cricket and expose the sport in the USA,\" tournament director Justin Geale, told AFP.\n\n\"We've got some of the best players in the world that can actually represent the product, do it justice. So it's going to be a good quality game of cricket that gives us the best chance to show existing fans and new fans the game.\n\n\"We've got as far as anyone ever has. So after all the false starts, I think it's finally here.\"\n\n'An exciting project'\n\nPart of the groundwork that MLC did was been the creation of Minor League Cricket, a 26-team competition which began in 2021 to spark domestic player development.\n\nThe teams will feature a maximum of six foreign players and a minimum of five domestic players and Geale says developing a talent pool for the USA national team is a big part of the mission.\n\n\"Building talent here domestically is one of our big pillars for sustainability,\" he said.\n\nIt will be a challenge for coaches and captains to manage teams with experienced international players alongside emerging domestic players but South African Robin Peterson, head coach of the Mumbai Indians-backed MI New York team, says it will work.\n\n\"In my experience, I found that the local boys tend to learn quite a bit playing alongside these superstars,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I've seen it firsthand in the SA20 and even if you look at the growth and trajectory of the Indian cricket since the inception of the IPL, it has just been amazing the amount of talent that they're producing.\n\n\"I see the league here playing a similar role for USA cricket.\"\n\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\n\nPeterson is optimistic that T20, much more than longer forms of the game, has the ingredients to win eyeballs in the American market.\n\n\"It's becoming more entertainment,\" he said. \"It speaks to the American sporting psyche where the players are a lot more physical, fitter, stronger, hit the ball further.\n\n\"It's an exciting project. I think it's about time people start taking cricket seriously in America.\""

        "body": "England’s all-time leading Test wicket-taker, James Anderson, has caught the attention of Major League Cricket (MLC) as a potential recruit for its 2025 season, following recent hints at a possible return to white-ball cricket.\n\nSenior figures from at least one unnamed MLC franchise are exploring whether the 42-year-old fast-bowling legend would be interested in participating in the growing T20 tournament in the United States, reported BBC Sport.\n\nAnderson, who retired from international cricket after amassing 704 Test wickets, recently joined the England backroom staff as a fast-bowling mentor.\n\nHowever, his comments about potentially returning to white-ball cricket have piqued the interest of MLC, which has successfully attracted several high-profile names, including Australia captain Pat Cummins and stars like Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head.\n\nAccording to a BBC report, should Anderson sign on, he could earn around 1,35,000 euros for a short stint in the competition, which is set to expand from 19 to 34 games in 2025.\n\nDespite his decade-long focus on red-ball cricket, Anderson has expressed confidence in his ability to still perform in the shorter format, even though his last T20 match was in 2014 for Lancashire in the T20 Blast.\n\nMLC, backed by influential figures such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, has made clear its ambitions to lure top English talent to the league. World Cup winners Liam Plunkett and Jason Roy have already featured in previous editions, with Roy signing a lucrative two-year deal worth 3,00,000 euros with the Los Angeles Knight Riders."

Meanwhile, since his retirement, the pacer engaged himself in coaching the national team as England men's bowling consultant. He also extended his contract for the upcoming winter tours of Pakistan and New Zealand.\n\n\"At the minute, I'm due to go to Pakistan and New Zealand in the winter. Then nothing concrete after that. I'm very new to this, I'm still learning as we go. It's partly me trying to figure out if this is where I want to go with the next stage of my career and also for them to figure out if I'm any good at it as well,\" Anderson told Sky Sports."

As per reports from UK, the veteran pacer is likely to make a return to white ball cricket. A team in the Major League Cricket (MLC) has expressed their desire and enquired about the availability of the star.\n\nAnd if things go right, Anderson might be in USA next season to take part in the third edition of the Major League Cricket. A team from the MLC is willing to explore if the English star who retired from Test cricket earlier this summer would be interested to play the franchise cricket.\n\nJames Anderson to set sail over the Pacific?\n\nAlbeit it would be a very short stint, but the veteran could be earning around 1.49cr INR from his stay in USA. Quite a few stars have shared their trade in the USA. One of the biggest stars in the mixes was Australia Cricket Team captain Pat Cummins who is slated to plat with San Francisco Unicorns till 2027.\n\nNot just the Aussie skipper other star players like Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Steve Smith has also played in MLC. Now it remains to be seen if the English veteran sets sail over the Pacific. Anderson last played a T20I match a decade ago, back in 2014. Against West Indies he played the first Test before hanging up his boots. But Jimmy Anderson joined the coaching staff and has a contract that runs till September."
