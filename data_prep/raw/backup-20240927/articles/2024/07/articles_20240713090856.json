Lahiru Milantha (33* off 30) and Obus Pineaar (31* off 30) then made a crucial partnership of 63 runs to guide Washington Freedom across their 125 run target with 10 balls to spare.\n\nWith this victory, Washington Freedom moved to the top of the table with 5 points from three matches, standing as the only unbeaten team in the tournament thus far.\n\nSeattle Orcas came out blazing to defend a low total of 125 runs. Imad Wasim dismissed Travis Head for a duck on the second ball of the innings, ending his over with a wicket and a maiden. Steve Smith and Rachin Ravindra then tried to rebuild the score with a counter attack, and they scored as many as 18 runs in the 3rd over. Ravindra was looking dangerous with his bat, but Nandre Burger dismissed him in the fifth over for 26 off 16 balls. Smith followed him back to pavilion in the over that followed with 12 off 13, leaving the Orcas at 47/3 after 6 overs.\n\nBoth Mukhtar Ahmed and Glenn Maxwell were given lifelines as both of their catches were dropped once, but they couldn’t make use of their second chances.

The Seattle batters struggled to accelerate on the slow batting track, only getting 35 runs in the powerplay.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen and Shubham Ranjane carefully made a crucial partnership that somewhat steadied Seattle’s innings. They crossed 100-run mark in the 15th over.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington bowlers didn’t allow the batters to score big.

Cameron Gannon struck a six, but was dismissed on his second attempt as Ferguson caught him out. Netravakar then removed Nandre Burger, thus bowling out Orcas at 124 in 19.4 overs."

Lahiru Milantha (33* off 30) and Obus Pienaar (31* off 30) then anchored a crucial unbeaten 63-run partnership to guide Washington Freedom past their 125-run target with 10 balls to spare.\n\nWith this win, Washington Freedom moved to the top of the points table with five points from three matches, remaining the only unbeaten team in the tournament thus far.\n\nSeattle Orcas Innings:\n\nSeattle Orcas struggled from the start, with Nauman Anwar falling cheaply for 3 off 9 balls to Saurabh Netravalkar in the second over. The batters found it difficult to accelerate on a slow batting track, managing only 35 runs in the Powerplay. Ryan Rickelton was dismissed for 4 off 11 balls by Lockie Ferguson in the sixth over.\n\nQuinton de Kock (24 off 19) started well but was bowled by Ferguson in the eighth over, leaving Seattle at 44/3. Heinrich Klaasen (51 off 29) tried to stabilize the innings with a half-century but was caught by Mukhtar Ahmed at long-off off Marco Jansen in the 15th over. Despite Klaasen's efforts, the rest of the batting lineup faltered, with Ferguson and Netravalkar dismantling the lower order.\n\nSeattle Orcas were eventually bowled out for 124 in 19.4 overs, with Cameron Gannon's brief attempt to add runs falling short as he was dismissed for 8 off 5 balls.\n\nWashington Freedom Innings\n\nChasing a modest total, Washington Freedom faced early setbacks. Imad Wasim removed Travis Head for a duck on the second ball, finishing the over with a wicket maiden. Steve Smith and Rachin Ravindra tried to rebuild with an aggressive approach, but Ravindra was dismissed by Nandre Burger for 26 off 16 balls in the fifth over, and Smith followed shortly after for 12 off 13 balls.\n\nMukhtar Ahmed and Glenn Maxwell were both given lifelines with dropped catches but couldn't capitalize. Ahmed fell for 8 off 8 balls, and Maxwell was dismissed for 10 off 11 balls, leaving Washington at 68/5 after 10 overs.\n\nHowever, Milantha and Pienaar displayed resilience, carefully steering the innings towards the target. They brought Washington Freedom to the 100-run mark in the 16th over, eventually surpassing the target with an unbeaten 63-run partnership, ensuring a win with 10 balls remaining.\n\nMLC 2024 Points Table Status after Washington Freedom win\n\nWith this victory, Washington Freedom climbed to the top of the points table, maintaining their unbeaten streak with five points from three matches.\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nSeattle Orcas: 124 all out in 19.4 overs (Heinrich Klaasen 51, Quinton de Kock 24; Lockie Ferguson 4/26)\n\nWashington Freedom: 125/5 in 18.2 overs (Lahiru Milantha 33*, Obus Pienaar 31*; Nandre Burger 2/27)."

This match will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, United States, on July 14th at 12:30 AM IST.\n\nAhead of the game, here is a look at the Dream11 predictions, the pitch report, fantasy tips, the top player picks and the best-predicted XIs for the fantasy contests of the match.\n\nLAS vs SF Head-to-Head Stats\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders and the San Francisco Unicorns have played two matches against each other so far. Both the games have been won by the Unicorns.\n\nLAS vs SF Pitch Report\n\nThe wicket at Chruch Street Park has looked good for batting. The batters have enjoyed the surface and have got full value for their shots. As for the bowlers, the pacers have had to rely on their cutters and variations in pace to be effective on this track. The spinners have also got some help from this wicket.\n\nHowever, with the incessant rain that has been happening here for the past 24 hours or so, there might be a might of moisture on the wicket and in the air, helping the new ball bowlers at the start of the innings.\n\nChurch Street Park Ground Stats (MLC 2024)\n\nMatches: 5\n\nMatches won batting first: 0\n\nMatches won batting second: 3\n\nNo Result or Abandoned: 2\n\nFantasy value from the pitch report\n\nThe pitch has been the best for batting in the first few overs when the ball is hard and coming on nicely to the bat. So, the top-order batters from both teams will be good picks for the game. Notably, the wicket has been easier to bat on in the second innings. So, keeping more batters from the team that is chasing could be a beneficial choice.\n\nThe spinners will be the best pick for this match. However, you can also back the faster bowlers who try to bowl into the wicket and mainly rely on the change of pace to deceive the batters.\n\nLAS vs SF Fantasy Cricket Tips\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nJason Roy, Unmukt Chand, and David Miller have been the inform batters for the Knight Riders. You can keep all three or at least two of these batters in your team if you are backing Los Angeles to win this game.\n\nSpencer Johnson has been in a great rhythm with the ball in this tournament so far. He is currently the wicket-taker for his team and will be a must-pick for the game. Andre Russell and Sunil Narine have not yet proved themselves with the ball in this tournament. However, the wicket at Church Streek Park might suit them, and the West Indian duo can give you high points.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nMatthew Short has been the man in for with the bat for the Unicorns. He has looked in supreme touch and will be one of the safest picks for the game. Finn Allen has also been in decent form and played a brilliant knock in the first game. Allen could also be a highly rewarding choice for the game.\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk has not yet found his rhythm with the bat in this tournament. However, the potential of this young Aussie batter is known to all, and he could be a decisive choice in the fantasy contests.\n\nBrody Couch has looked good with the ball and will be one of the safer picks from the Unicorns' bowling. You can also keep Haris Rauf in your team, as his ability to hit the deck could prove to be beneficial on this track. However, the game changer in this game could be the young Paksitanin spinner, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nLAS vs SF Winner Prediction\n\nThe wicket will favour the batters, and we can expect to see a match where both the teams will go past the 160 mark. In the games that have already taken place here in this edition of the MLC, we have seen that batting has got relatively easier in the second innings, and hence, the team chasing the target will have the advantage in the game.\n\nLAS vs SF Top Player Picks\n\nUnmukt Chand (LAS)\n\nThe Indian-origin US batter has looked in a decent touch with the bat. Although Unmukt Chand has not fired after the first game of the tournament, the form that he seems to be in makes him one of the safer choices from the Los Angeles batting line-up.\n\nSpencer Johnson has been the best bowler for the Los Angeles in MLC 2024 [X]\n\nSpencer Johnson (LAS)\n\nThe young Aussie speedster from this team looked the most impressive with the ball. Spencer Johnson has the most number of wickets in the tournament for his team and will be one of the better picks for the fantasy contests.\n\nMatt Short (SF)\n\nThe Australian top order batter has been in prime touch and has looked ominous in both the games. Matt Short has the form and rhythm with him and will be looking to build on that on a track that will encourage his audacious stroke play.\n\nAbrar Ahmed (SF)\n\nThough this Pakistan leggie has not picked up wicket, he has looked impressive with the areas the he has bowled. On a pitch, that might provide a bit of assistance to the spinners, Abrar Ahmed could be a good choice for the game.\n\nLAS vs SF Differential Picks\n\nAndre Russell (LAS)\n\nThis Jamaican all-rounder has not yet been at his best in the tournament. But there is no questioning the match-winning abilities of Andre Russell with both the bat and the ball. If he gets a bit of rhythm going for himselft, Russell could prove to be a game-changing pick for the match.\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk has not yet fired in MLC 2024 [X]\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk (SF)\n\nThis young Aussie batter is known for his explosive batting style. Though Jake Fraser-McGurk has not found form in this edition of the MLC so far, he could be a decisive choice for the fantasy contests if he starts finding the middle of the bat.\n\nLAS vs SF Fantasy Expert Advice\n\nWait for the toss and keep more top-order batters from the team that bats second. A 2-2-4-3 or a 1-2-3-5 combination could work well for the game.\n\nLAS vs SF Fantasy Team for Head-to-Head/Small Leagues\n\nWicketkeepers: Unmukt Chand, Josh Inglis\n\nBatters: Jason Roy, Finn Allen\n\nAll-rounders: Shakib Al Hasan, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Matthew Short\n\nBowlers: Abrar Ahmed, Spencer Johnson, Brody Couch\n\nCaptain: Sunil Narine\n\nVice-captain: Andre Russsell\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: 6 Players; San Francisco Unicorns: 5 Players\n\nLAS vs SF Fantasy Team for Winner Takes All/ Grand Leagues\n\nWicketkeeper: Josh Inglis\n\nBatters: David Miller, Jake Fraser-McGurk\n\nAll-rounders: Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell, Matthew Short\n\nBowlers: Ali Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Spencer Johnson, Hairs Rauf, Brody Couch\n\nCaptain: Jake Fraser-McGurk\n\nVice-captain: Abrar Ahmed"

In the second innings, Washington Freedom faced an early setback with the dismissal of Travis Head (1). Steve Smith initially took a couple of overs to settle in, but once he found his rhythm and struck his first boundary on his seventh ball, the New York bowlers struggled to contain him. The Australian star batter smashed four fours and three sixes, racing to an impressive 46* off 28 balls.\n\nWith 7.4 overs of the Washington Freedom innings done, the match took a turn for the worse as rain and lighting brought on the covers. However, Smith’s power-hitting in the final over of the powerplay took them ahead on DLS with a score of 55/1. In the end, that proved enough to seal the match as rain played spoilsport."

        "body": "In a gripping encounter of the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024, the Seattle Orcas faced off against the Washington Freedom at a packed stadium. Washington Freedom emerged victorious, chasing down a target set by the Orcas with five wickets in hand.\n\nSteve Smith looks visibly upset on his dismissal\n\nThe match witnessed a standout moment when Cameron Gannon, bowling for the Seattle Orcas, delivered a stunning blow to dismiss the renowned Steve Smith of Washington Freedom. Gannon’s delivery, clocking in at 135 kmph, landed on a perfect length angled towards the off-stump. Smith, known for his aggressive stroke play, charged down the pitch aiming to drive through the off-side.\n\nHowever, Gannon’s deceptive movement caught Smith off-guard. The ball nipped back slightly, kissing the under edge of Smith’s bat before dislodging the off bail. The dismissal left Smith visibly frustrated as he departed the crease after contributing just 12 runs to his team’s chase.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Mitchell Santner hits a mammoth 106-metre six during SFU vs TSK match in MLC 2024\n\nWashington Freedom gets the better of Seattle Orcas\n\nSeattle Orcas, after being put into bat, struggled to build partnerships against a disciplined bowling attack from Washington Freedom. They managed to post a total of 124 all out in 19.4 overs, with Heinrich Klaasen‘s brisk 51 off 30 deliveries being the highlight of their innings. Lockie Ferguson was the chief tormentor for Washington Freedom, claiming impressive figures of 4/26, while Saurabh Netravalkar supported well with 3/18.\n\nIn response, Washington Freedom achieved the target comfortably in 18.2 overs, reaching 127/5. Lahiru Milantha anchored the innings with an unbeaten 33, supported by Obus Pienaar‘s crucial 31 not out. Their partnership ensured that Washington Freedom crossed the finish line without much trouble, securing a significant victory in the MLC 2024 season.\n\nThe match showcased thrilling moments of skill and strategy, reaffirming the competitive spirit of the exciting tournament.

        "date": "Fri Jul 12 10:35:34 2024",
        "body": "In a thrilling encounter at the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024, Washington Freedom emerged victorious against Seattle Orcas, thanks to an outstanding performance by Rachin Ravindra. The match held at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas saw Washington Freedom successfully chase down Seattle Orcas’s target of 125 runs in the first inning.\n\nRachin Ravindra’s spectacular onslaught against Imad Wasim\n\nSeattle Orcas, batting first, scored 124 runs before being bowled out. This set Washington Freedom’s target of 125 runs to achieve victory. Chasing the set total, the Washington side faced an early setback as Travis Head was dismissed in the very first over, leaving them at 6/1.\n\nHowever, Ravindra’s entry into the game proved to be a turning point. Coming in to bat, Ravindra faced Wasim in the third over of the 2nd innings.\n\nRavindra hammered 17 runs off Wasim in a single over, comprising two sixes and a four. This onslaught boosted Washington Freedom’s run rate and rattled the opposition. Wasim, who had earlier taken the wicket of Head in his first spell, struggled against Ravindra’s aggressive batting. Despite finishing his 4-over spell with a total of 31 runs, Wasim’s over to Ravindra stood out for its impact on the match.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Cameron Gannon cleans up Steve Smith during SO vs WF game in MLC 2024\n\nRachin Ravindra’s dominance secures Washington Freedom’s convincing victory\n\nRavindra’s innings was pivotal as he went on to score 26 runs off just 16 balls at a striking rate of 162.50, including three fours and two sixes. Both of his sixes came off Wasim’s bowling in that memorable over, showcasing his dominance over the experienced bowler. In the end, Washington Freedom comfortably reached the finish line in the 19th over , finishing with a score of 127 for the loss of 5 wickets. This comprehensive victory underscored Washington Freedom’s dominance and resilience throughout the match."
