The LA Knight Riders will also have Sunil Narine to choose from.\n\nThe West Indian all-rounder was voted as the most valuable player at the 2024 Indian Premier League. Adam Zampa is right up there as one of the best T20 bowlers in the world.\n\nThe leg-spinner will no doubt make an impact for his new franchise.
