        "body": "Here are the Fantasy Cricket Predictions and Betting Tips for the Major League Cricket Match 1- Seattle Orcas vs MI New York and Match 2- LA Knight Riders vs Texas Super Kings, which will be played on the 5th of July at the Church Street Park, Morrisville and the Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas.\n\nBatting Stats T20\n\nLIVE SCORES - Match 1 - Seattle Orcas vs MI New York (Church Street Park, Morrisville)\n\nCurrent Form MI New York:\n\nMI New York are the defending champions of the Major League Cricket. They beat Seattle Orcas comfortably in the Final match of the last season.\n\nThe top run scorer for MI New York in the previous edition was Nicholas Pooran with 388 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for MI New York in the previous edition was Trent Boult with 22 scalps under his belt.\n\nMI New York have retained their explosive batter Nicholas Pooran as well as Steven Taylor for this year's edition. Their bowling looks strong too with the inclusion of Rashid Khan in the squad. Considering their squad strength, MI New York will start as favorites for winning the tournament.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Nicholas Pooran - He played brilliantly in the last edition of the Major League Cricket. He was the top run scorer for the season. Pooran is an exciting player who can change the course of the game in a matter of few balls.\n\n2. Rashid Khan - One of the best T20 spinners in World Cricket, Khan will be vested with the responsibility of putting a leash on to the opponents with his tight bowling.\n\nCurrent Form Seattle Orcas:\n\nSeattle Orcas are the runners up of the Major League Cricket. They lost the Final match of the last edition.\n\nThe top run scorer for Seattle Orcas in the previous edition was Quinton de Kock with 264 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Seattle Orcas in the previous edition was Cameron Gannon with 11 scalps under his belt.\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup hero for USA, Harmeet Singh is a part of the Seattle Orcas squad. He will add a great dimension to their team. Heinrich Klaasen, Quinton de Kock and Nathan Ellis are also part of the squad. Seattle Orcas are looking good on papers and should go a long way in the tournament.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Quinton de Kock - He looked in sublime touch in the recently concluded ICC Men's T20 World Cup and almost won the match for South Africa in the Finals. Quinton de Kock will play an important role for Seattle Orcas in the upcoming matches.\n\n2. Nathan Ellis - He is one of the best T20 bowlers in World cricket. Ellis can take early wickets in the Powerplay overs and put pressure on to the opposition.\n\nLet’s have a look at the squads:\n\nMI New York\n\nNicholas Pooran, Shayan Jahangir, Nosthusha Kenjige, Dewald Brevis, Rushil Ugarkar, Ruben Clinton, Anrich Nortje, Monank Patel, Steven Taylor, Romario Shepherd, Trent Boult, Ehsan Adil, Tim David, Heath Richards, Kagiso Rabada, Rashid Khan, Kieron Pollard\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nNandre Burger, Harmeet Singh, Obed McCoy, Nathan Ellis, Shubham Ranjane, Andrew Tye, Angelo Perera, Hayden Walsh, Nauman Anwar, Michael Bracewell, Dwaine Pretorius, Nisarg Patel, Shimron Hetmyer, Cameron Gannon, Dasun Shanaka, Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen, Shehan Jayasuriya, Wayne Parnell, Quinton de Kock, Ryan Rickelton, Imad Wasim, Phani Simhardi\n\nCricket Betting Tips and Match Predictions* - PrePlay\n\nWho will win the toss? – MI New York\n\nWho will win?- MI New York\n\nTop Batter (Runs Scored) - Nicholas Pooran (MI New York), Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas)\n\nTop Bowler (Wickets taken) - Rashid Khan (MI New York), Nathan Ellis (Seattle Orcas)\n\nMost Sixes – Nicholas Pooran (MI New York), Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas)\n\nPlayer of the Match- Rashid Khan (MI New York)\n\nTeam Scores Batting first – MI New York 160+, Seattle Orcas 150+\n\nMatch Handicap: MI New York\n\nWicket Takers T20\n\nLIVE SCORES - Match 2 - LA Knight Riders vs Texas Super Kings (Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas)\n\nCurrent Form LA Knight Riders:\n\nLA Knight Riders finished at the bottom most position on points table in the previous season of Major League Cricket. They managed to win only one match out of the 5 games they participated in.\n\nThe top run scorer for LA Knight Riders in the previous edition was Andre Russell with 206 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for LA Knight Riders in the previous edition was Adam Zampa with 9 scalps under his belt.\n\nLA Knight Riders have retained their premium spinner Adam Zampa. He was the leading wicket taker for LA Knight Riders last season. They also have capable batters in Andre Russell, Jason Roy and David Miller. Sunil Narine, who is in the form of his life is also part of the LA Knight Riders squad.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Sunil Narine - He showed great signs of form in the recently concluded Indian Premier League. He can change the course of the match both with bat and the ball. Narine is expected to be LA Knight Riders' best player in the Major League Cricket.\n\n2. Jason Roy - He is an experienced campaigner who is capable of playing long innings and placing the opposition under pressure right from the word go.\n\nCurrent Form Texas Super Kings:\n\nTexas Super Kings finished at the 2nd position on points table after league stages of the previous edition. They lost to MI New York in the Challenger match and got knocked out.\n\nThe top run scorer for Texas Super Kings in the previous edition was Devon Conway with 221 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Texas Super Kings in the previous edition was Mohammad Mohsin with 9 scalps under his belt.\n\nTexas Super Kings have a relatively weaker squad compared to the other teams. They do match winners in their team like Gerald Coetzee, Daniel Sams and Devon Conway. However, their chances for making it to the Playoffs are bleak.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Faf du Plessis- He can hit the ball a long way and provide quick starts to his team in the powerplay overs. Faf du Plessis will play an important role for Texas Super Kings in the tournament.\n\n2. Mitchell Santner- He is a wily left arm spinner who doesn't leak runs and also has a knack of picking up wickets in the middle overs period.\n\nLet’s have a look at the squads\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nMartin Guptill, Jaskaran Malhotra, Alex Carey, Spencer Johnson, Saif Badar, Ali Sheikh, Andre Russell, David Miller, Unmukt Chand, Bhaskar Yadram, Ali Khan, Rilee Rossouw, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Sunil Narine, Jason Roy, Shakib Al Hasan, Gajanand Singh, Lockie Ferguson, Adam Zampa, Nitish Kumar\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nRusty Theron, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Imran Tahir, Calvin Savage, Faf du Plessis, Marcus Stoinis, Gerald Coetzee, Devon Conway, Milind Kumar, Zia Shahzad, Mohammad Mohsin, Matthew Tromp, Naveen-ul-Haq, Dwayne Bravo, Daniel Sams, Cody Chetty, Noor Ahmad,Sami Aslam, Mitchell Santner, Zia ul-Haq, Lahiru Milantha, Cameron Stevenson\n\nCricket Betting Tips and Match Predictions* - PrePlay\n\nWho will win the toss? – Texas Super Kings\n\nWho will win?- LA Knight Riders\n\nTop Batter (Runs Scored) - Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings), Jason Roy (LA Knight Riders)\n\nTop Bowler (Wickets taken) - Mitchell Santner (Texas Super Kings), Sunil Narine (LA Knight Riders)\n\nMost Sixes – Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings), Jason Roy (LA Knight Riders)\n\nPlayer of the Match- Sunil Narine (LA Knight Riders)\n\nTeam Scores Batting first – Texas Super Kings 140+, LA Knight Riders 150+\n\nMatch Handicap: LA Knight Riders\n\nLive Cricket Streaming Major League Cricket 2024: The live cricket streaming page which enables you to watch live cricket - Geo-restrictions apply\n\n*NB these predictions may be changed nearer the start of the match once the final starting teams have been announced and we will be running ‘In-Play’ features, so stay tuned.\n\n© Cricket World 2024"

The Bangla tigers will take on their next-door neighbours in two Tests and three T20Is which begin from September 19 to October 12.\n\nThe all-rounder has already left for the USA on July 1 to take part in the Los Angeles Knight Riders’ upcoming season in Major League cricket. He suggested that he is not thinking too far ahead and remains focused on taking part in MLC followed by Canada’s Global T20 League.\n\n“I don’t have many plans. There are two T20 tournaments in front of me one is MLC and the other one is the Global T20 League in Canada.

He finished the T20 World Cup 2024 with only 111 runs in the seven games he was a part of and his strike rate was disastrous at just 106.73. With the ball, he ended up with just three wickets through the campaign.\n\nREAD MORE: PCB Chairman Advised Against Massive Changes in Pakistan Team Due To Pressure From Senior Players\n\nThe south-paw has been featuring for the Bangladesh side for quite some time and his recent performances have warranted questions from the likes of Virender Sehwag who questioned whether it was time for him to give his spot to someone younger, keeping the future in perspective.\n\nSo far Shakib has not done anything to indicate that he might call time on his international career. He, however, continues to regularly feature in franchise cricket across many leagues and his experience will be key to returning to his best form."

        "date": "Tue Jul  2 21:49:31 2024",
        "body": "Bangladesh star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan said he preferred to make short-term plans rather than long-term ones, considering that the 37-year-old is in the twilight of his career.\n\nShakib left for the USA earlier today to take part in the upcoming season of Major League Cricket, starting on July 6. He will play for the Los Angeles Knight Riders and will then make the journey across the border to play for Bangla Tigers Mississauga in the Global T20 in Canada which will begin on July 25.\n\nFollowing the back-to-back franchise tournaments, Shakib will be expected to return to national colours in August when Bangladesh will tour Pakistan for a two-match Test series.\n\n\"I haven't really planned much. And I don't really have that much time to plan for three-four years. I think that it is good to plan for three months, or six months. So up until now, my planning goes as far as the Pakistan series,\" Shakib told reporters at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport before leaving for the USA on Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't have a plan regarding myself. At this moment, I'm looking forward to the two T20 tournaments, one is Major League Cricket for which I'm heading to the USA followed by the Global T20 League in Canada. I'll play these back-to-back tournaments and then will see where things are. After that, there is the Test series against Pakistan. So, my planning is about these three competitions.\"\n\nShakib has been going through a lean patch with both bat and ball. While his batting has left a lot to be desired in the past two ICC events (the 2023 ODI World Cup and 2020 T20 World Cup), his ability to strike with the ball, which has rarely come into question throughout his career, has taken a nosedive.\n\nIn an abysmal campaign in the recently concluded T20 World Cup, Shakib managed just 111 runs in seven matches at a strike-rate of 106.73. He did score a fifty against the Netherlands in their Super 8 run in the tournament but that was all that one would remember from his campaign. With the ball, he picked up three wickets at an economy rate of 7.50 and it was not until Bangladesh's fourth match of the group-stage against Nepal that the left-arm spinner was able to register his first wicket. He took two in the match and scalped one in a Super 8 fixture against India meaning he went wicketless in five matches in the major event.\n\nThe interesting part about Shakib's statement was that he was not particularly keen on long-term plans and it won't be a surprise if he is picky when deciding which matches to play in the upcoming series. There have been a few instances in which Shakib has opted out of Tests in the recent past. Moreover, his sporadic absences have often left the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) struggling to explain the reasoning behind his unavailability. So, BCB would have a hard time planning ahead with Shakib in the mix but the loop of the board chasing the Bangladesh star for his availability may very well continue."

Shakib Al Hasan said that he is only planning up to the Pakistan series and will reassess his situation after playing in the Major League Cricket (MLC) and Global T20 League in Canada.\n\nBangladesh is scheduled to play two Tests and three T20Is against India from September 19 to October 12, after their tour of Pakistan in August, where they will play a two-match Test series. The first Test will be played in Chennai on September 19, followed by the second Test in Kanpur on September 27.\n\nDon't Have Many Plans - Shakib Al Hasan\n\nShakib Al Hasan left Dhaka for the USA on Monday to join the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the upcoming Major League Cricket. The 37-year-old all-rounder mentioned that he has short-term plans of three to six months rather than long-term planning.\n\n\"I don't have many plans. There are two T20 tournaments in front of me one is MLC and the other one is the Global T20 League in Canada and let me see where I stand after playing these two tournaments because I need to understand [how I feel],\" Shakib told reporters.\n\n\"There is international cricket and there is a series against Pakistan and I am planning till that point of time and not planning beyond that. Now I don't have time to plan for three-four years and so planning for three to six months is better and later will think about my next plan and so till now I am planning till the Pakistan series,\" he added.\n\nShakib had a disappointing outing with both bat and ball in the recently concluded T20 World Cup 2024. The left-handed batter scored 111 runs in seven matches at an average of 18.50 and a strike rate of 106.73. The left-arm spinner managed to secure three wickets at an economy rate of 7.50 in the World Cup.\n\nIt Was Difficult To Pick Taskin Ahmed - Shakib Al Hasan\n\nShakib Al Hasan revealed that pace bowler Taskin Ahmed apologized to his teammates for missing the game against India. Shakib stated that Taskin arrived just minutes before the toss, making it challenging to include him in the team.\n\n\"When Taskin arrived it was five to 10 minutes before the toss and certainly it was difficult to pick him at that point in the team and it was difficult for him as well. Taskin apologized to the team for that afterward and everyone in the team took it normally because a man can mistakes and anyone can commit unintentional mistakes and he accepted it and the thing ended at that point in time,\" Shakib said.\n\nBangladesh made a questionable team selection by excluding vice captain Taskin Ahmed in the Super 8 fixture against India. According to Cricbuzz, Taskin missed the match due to arriving late because of oversleeping. He returned for the next match against Afghanistan and took one wicket for 12 runs in his four overs.\n\nBangladesh were eliminated from the World Cup without securing a single victory in the Super Eight stage during the World Cup in the West Indies and the United States of America (USA). The Bangladesh team lost to Australia, India, and Afghanistan in the Super 8 matches."

        "body": "The inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket saw MI New York win the title in the finals after they beat Seattle Orcas by 7 wickets. It was glory and triumph in equal numbers as they etched history to win the first-ever Major League Cricket title.\n\nThe core of the team remains the same as the likes of Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard and Trent Boult will be the key members to watch out for. Undoubtedly, they have one of the strongest and most formidable sides in this competition.\n\nSeveral USA cricketers in the form of Monank Patel, Steven Taylor and Shayan Jahangir will be players to watch out for as Kieron Pollard and co. look to defend their title.\n\nIn this article, we take a look at 3 reasons why MI New York can defend their title in Major League Cricket 2024:\n\n1. Well-rounded balanced side\n\nMI New York have a lot of superstars in their team and all of them would be looking to sparkle together in order to win something big in the 2nd edition of the Major League Cricket 2024.\n\nThe batting department has some big guns in the form of Nicholas Pooran, Tim David and Kieron Pollard. On the other hand, the bowlers in the form of Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult and Sunny Singh will be looking to leave a mark.\n\n2. Able leadership\n\nMI New York’s captain Kieron Pollard has served the Mumbai-branch of the MI franchise for 14 long seasons and is also the present batting coach of Mumbai Indians. He is a vastly experienced campaigner and has won a lot of titles in this T20 franchise cricketing career.\n\nPollard had sustained a shoulder injury in the last league game of MI New York in the previous edition and therefore Nicholas Pooran, had to don the captain’s hat.\n\nThe swashbuckling southpaw led the team extremely well and also played a jaw-dropping innings in the finals to lift the title. Pooran had smashed 137* runs in 55 deliveries and had sent shockwaves down the spines of the opposition team.\n\n3. Quality domestic talent\n\nMI New York have USA’s cricket team’s captain Monank Patel in their ranks and also have Steven Taylor. Both these players had a good outing in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and would be confident of good performances in this competition.\n\nLeft-arm orthodox spinner Nosthush Kenjige will be another key talent to watch out for and he has grown in confidence, in the last few years. Kenjige had bagged 3 wickets in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 for USA."

With its inaugural season played in 2023, the MI New York were the standout performers in the league and went on to be the champions under skipper Nick Pooran, who played a stunning hand in their title victory.\n\nWith some very crucial signings, especially with the drafting of several Australian maestros ahead of the 2nd edition, the MLC will be a contest worth witnessing.\n\nWith a new set of players, along with the retained players from the first season, let’s take a look at the Top 5 batters who stand a chance to score the highest runs ahead of MLC 2024.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTop 5 batters who stand a chance to score the highest runs ahead of MLC 2024\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have drafted the big Australian for their 2024 MLC campaign. The last time semifinalists had already had quite some spectacular performers in their team sheets, while Stoinis will be an in-form inclusion to the side.\n\nThe big Australian was a commanding performer in the Indian Premier League and also performed overwhelmingly for his national side in the T20 World Cup. Stoinis, who has evolved to be a middle-order batter, letting go of his role as a finisher has helped sides retain him, and his evolving bowling skills are a cherry on top.\n\nQuinton de Kock\n\nThe South African veteran, who announced his retirement from the Tests and ODIs, has been a constant surprise in the shortest format of the game. He has been a part of every global T20 league since he stopped featuring for the Proteas.\n\nPlaying for the Seattle Orcas, QDK scored 264 runs, averaging a brilliant 44 in the 7 games of the tournament. He is one of the most worthy retentions of the MLC 2024, and his contributions are supposed to be of great value to his team. In short, the veteran can once again be found among the top scorers of the league.\n\nYOU MAY LIKE IT: IND vs ZIM: 3 bowlers to watch out for in India’s tour of Zimbabwe who can be assets in the T20 World Cup 2026\n\nJ.Fraser-McGurk\n\nThe hard-hitting youngster from Australia is now gaining the status of a world-class T20 batter due to his fearless stride and fast run-scoring in the powerplay, for which he has often received praise and recognition from players around the world.\n\nFeaturing for the Delhi Capitals in the IPL 2024, McGurk was one of the very reasons the Capitals bounced back in the later stages of the competition. Though he was not the most consistent performer, he added fire to the innings whenever he got going in the powerplay.\n\nSuch will be his role, as the 21-year-old is about to make his debut in yet another league featuring players of global standard. Picked by the San Francisco Unicorns, McGruk will be most probably seen alongside Finn Allen, and together they can be the most explosive opening pair of MLC 2024.\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nThe West Indies wk-bat has been a constant performer over the recent few years, in whichever league he has played in. From playing in the IPL for Lucknow Super Giants to making vital contributions to his team’s score in the T20 World Cup, Pooran is one of the most reliable batters to keep your cards on.\n\nThe small-packet dynamite is often seen hitting massive sixes; it was his blistering knock of 137 runs on just 55 balls that included 13 sixes, which took MI New York over the line, and they went on to be the champions of the debut season. Not only MI New York but the entire cricket world would hope to witness such brilliance from the Windies batter.\n\nTravis Head"
