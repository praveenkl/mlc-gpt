        "body": "Here are the Fantasy Cricket Predictions and Betting Tips for the Major League Cricket Match 18- San Francisco Unicorns vs Settle Orcas, which will be played on the 20th of July at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas.\n\nPoints Table\n\nMatch 18- San Francisco Unicorns vs Seattle Orcas (Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas)\n\nCurrent Form San Francisco Unicorns:\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns are currently placed at the 2nd position on points table with 3 wins and 1 loss to their credit.\n\nThe top run scorer for San Francisco Unicorns in the Major League Cricket is Matthew Short with 151 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for San Francisco Unicorns in the Major League Cricket is Liam Plunkett with 5 scalps under his belt.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have won their previous match against MI New York by 3 runs.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns batted first and they posted a total of 148 for 7 in 20 overs. The top order struggled a lot. Their prime form batters including Matthew Short and Josh Inglis got out cheaply. They were under a lot of pressure from that moment on. The middle order of San Francisco Unicorns came good as Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan smashed 59 and 44 runs respectively to help San Francisco Unicorns get to a strong total of 148 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Seattle Orcas lost Ruben Clinton quite early into the innings. Dewald Brevis played like a champion and he smashed 56 runs off 36 balls. He instilled the hope for a successful chase. Nicholas Pooran also supported him well, he scored 26 runs but consumed too many balls to get going. It cost the team dearly. The rest of the middle order batters including Romario Shepherd and Monank Patel failed terribly and despite the efforts of Heath Richards, who smashed 24 off 13 balls, Seattle Orcas failed to achieve the target and fell short by 3 runs in the end.\n\nCurrent Form Seattle Orcas:\n\nSeattle Orcas are currently placed at the bottom most position on points table with 1 win and 4 losses to their credit.\n\nThe top run scorer for Seattle Orcas in the Major League Cricket is Ryan Rickelton with 225 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Seattle Orcas in the Major League Cricket is Cameron Gannon with 9 scalps under his belt.\n\nSeattle Orcas have lost their previous match against LA Knight Riders by 4 wickets.\n\nSeattle Orcas batted first and they posted a total of 142 for 6 in 20 overs. Except for Ryan Rickelton, no other batter showed any promise whatsoever. The big names like Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen and Aaron Jones, all failed to get going. Rickelton smashed 89 off 52 balls but he barely got any support at the other end. Once he got out in the 19th over, it was all clear that Orcas will not reach a decent total. They were littled and only scored 142 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Sunil Narine as usual got out cheaply. Jason Roy tried his best to take control but he consumed too many balls for his knock of 27 runs. A real game changing innings was played by Unmukt Chand, who smashed 62 runs off 47 balls. He was aided by the lower order batters who contributed healthily and helped LA Knight Riders get over the line in the 20th over with 4 wickets in hand.\n\nBatting Stats T20\n\nLet’s have a look at the squads:\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nPat Cummins, Qais Ahmad, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Henry, Mackenzie Harvey, Lungi Ngidi, Brody Couch, Tajinder Singh, Josh Inglis, Matthew Wade, Jahmar Hamilton, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Smit Patel, David White, Corey Anderson, Finn Allen, Carmi le RouxLiam Plunkett, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Haris Rauf, Shadab Khan\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nNandre Burger, Harmeet Singh, Obed McCoy, Nathan Ellis, Shubham Ranjane, Andrew Tye, Angelo Perera, Hayden Walsh, Nauman Anwar, Michael Bracewell, Dwaine Pretorius, Nisarg Patel, Shimron Hetmyer, Cameron Gannon, Dasun Shanaka, Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen, Shehan Jayasuriya, Wayne Parnell, Quinton de Kock, Ryan Rickelton, Imad Wasim, Phani Simhardi\n\nWicket Takers T20"

However, Finn Allen's explosive 77 off 30 balls took the San Francisco Unicorns to a comfortable six-wicket win.\n\nWith this victory, the San Francisco Unicorns remain in second place on the points table with nine points from six matches, while the Seattle Orcas have been officially eliminated from the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nAlready qualified for the playoffs, the San Francisco Unicorns began their run chase of 153 runs at a blistering pace. They smashed 79 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to Finn Allen's 21-ball fifty. He struck 26 runs in the fifth over, bowled by Lungi Ngidi, which featured two sixes and three fours.\n\nMatthew Short, on the other hand, was dismissed by Imad Wasim in the seventh over after scoring 19 off 14 balls. Allen continued in the same vein, hitting two sixes off Harmeet Singh before being caught by Ryan Rickelton on the fifth ball of the eighth over. He scored 77 off 30 balls, leaving San Francisco at 98/2 after eight overs.\n\nThe Unicorns then lost two more wickets in consecutive overs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed for 10 off 16 balls in the 13th over, followed by Sherfane Rutherford in the 14th, who scored 17 off 8 balls. However, Josh Inglis and Corey Anderson guided San Francisco to a comfortable six-wicket win with 34 balls to spare.\n\nIn a must-win game, the Seattle Orcas faced a disastrous start after being invited to bat first. They lost both openers in the very first over: Ryan Rickelton was caught by Finn Allen on the first ball, and Aaron Jones was trapped LBW by Carmi le Roux.\n\nDespite an early setback, Seattle managed to score 48 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to an aggressive counter-attack by Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya. They added 34 runs in the last two overs of the Powerplay, bringing the score to 48/2.\n\nDe Kock reached his half-century off 28 balls by the 10th over. Alongside Jayasuriya, he added 31 runs off Pat Cummins' first two overs, pushing Seattle to 98/2 after 11 overs. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the 12th over as both de Kock (62 off 33) and Jayasuriya (31 off 33) were dismissed in quick succession by Brody Couch.\n\nHassan Khan then delivered a decisive blow to Seattle Orcas, as he struck thrice in his two consecutive overs. He dismissed Heinrich Klaasen (8 off 8) in the 14th over, and Harmeet Singh (3 off 7) and Keemo Paul (0 off 1) in the 16th over, reducing Seattle to 116/7.\n\nIt was Shubham Ranjane, who came to the rescue as he played a crucial unbeaten knock of 26 runs off 25 balls, helping Seattle post a total of 152/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-0 (Ryan Rickelton - 0.1 ov), 2-1 (Aaron Jones - 0.3 ov), 3-98 (Quinton de Kock - 11.1 ov), 4-99 (Shehan Jayasuriya - 11.4 ov), 5-108 (Heinrich Klaasen - 13.1 ov), 6-116 (Harmeet Singh - 15.5 ov), 7-116 (Keemo Paul - 15.6 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Fall of wickets: 1-84 (Matthew Short - 6.4 ov), 2-98 (Finn Allen - 7.5 ov), 3-124 (Sanjay Krishnamurthi - 12.1 ov), 4-144 (Sherfane Rutherford - 13.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen\n\nMatthew Short\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nJosh Inglis(WK)\n\nSherfane Rutherford\n\nCorey Anderson(C)\n\nHassan Khan\n\nPat Cummins\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nCarmi le Roux\n\nBrody Couch\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nRyan Rickelton\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nAaron Jones\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nKeemo Paul\n\nImad Wasim\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nLungi Ngidi\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Sunday, July 21, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: San Francisco Unicorns elected to bowl"

Still, SFU will try to finish in top two to earn that extra chance of redemption.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nMeanwhile, the tournament is fairly over for the Seattle Orcas, as they are seated at the bottom of the table with only 2 points in five games.\n\nThe Orcas have failed to click this year, and their shortcomings were exposed in the previous four-wicket loss against Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nSeattle Orcas, despite a blazing 89 (52) knock from Ryan Rickleton, succumbed to a 142-run total in the first innings.\n\nHarmeet Singh and Keemo Paul tried their best to put a stoppage on the flow of runs in the chase.\n\nBut Unmukt Chand’s 62-run knock set the stage right for LAKR. They finished the chase with five balls to spare, leaving the Orcas in tatters.\n\nWith just two games left on the league schedule, the playoff dream is more or less lost for the Orcas.\n\nSF vs SEA: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSF vs SEA: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium features a hybrid pitch that provides a balanced playing field, catering to both batters and bowlers.\n\nThe pitch generally offers an even bounce. However, the degree of bounce can vary depending on weather conditions and the level of maintenance. 145-150 is the average first-innings score on this surface.\n\nSF vs SEA: Probable Playing XIs\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Finn Allen, Matthew Short, Josh Inglis (wk), Corey Anderson (c), Sherfane Rutherford, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Hassan Khan, Pat Cummins, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Brody Couch\n\nSeattle Orcas: Ryan Rickelton, Quinton de Kock (wk), Shehan Jayasuriya, Aaron Jones, Michael Bracewell, Heinrich Klaasen (c), Keemo Paul, Harmeet Singh, Cameron Gannon, Lungi Ngidi, Ali Sheikh\n\nSF vs SEA: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nSF vs SEA: Winner Prediction\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns are undoubtedly a stronger team compared to the Seattle Orcas, and hence, the former are the favourites to win this upcoming contest."

        "body": "Dallas [Texas], July 21 (ANI): An impressive spell by Hassan Khan and a quick-fire half-century by Finn Allen helped the San Francisco Unicorns register a six-wicket win over the Seattle Orcas in the 18th match of the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Saturday.\n\nAfter losing their openers in the first over, Quinton de Kock anchored the innings with 62 off 33 balls, helping the Seattle Orcas post a total of 152/7. However, Finn Allen's explosive 77 off 30 balls took the San Francisco Unicorns to a comfortable six-wicket win.\n\nAlso Read | IND-W vs UAE-W Dream11 Team Prediction, Women's Asia Cup T20 2024 Match: Tips and Suggestions To Pick Best Winning Fantasy Playing XI for India Women vs United Arab Emirates Women in Dambulla.\n\nWith this victory, the San Francisco Unicorns remain in second place on the points table with nine points from six matches, while the Seattle Orcas have been officially eliminated from the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nAlready qualified for the playoffs, the San Francisco Unicorns began their run chase of 153 runs at a blistering pace. They smashed 79 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to Finn Allen's 21-ball fifty. He struck 26 runs in the fifth over, bowled by Lungi Ngidi, which featured two sixes and three fours.\n\nAlso Read | India Women vs United Arab Emirates Women Free Live Streaming Online, Women's Asia Cup T20 2024: How To Watch IND-W vs UAE-W Cricket Match Live Telecast on TV?.\n\nMatthew Short, on the other hand, was dismissed by Imad Wasim in the seventh over after scoring 19 off 14 balls. Allen continued in the same vein, hitting two sixes off Harmeet Singh before being caught by Ryan Rickelton on the fifth ball of the eighth over. He scored 77 off 30 balls, leaving San Francisco at 98/2 after eight overs.\n\nThe Unicorns then lost two more wickets in consecutive overs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed for 10 off 16 balls in the 13th over, followed by Sherfane Rutherford in the 14th, who scored 17 off 8 balls. However, Josh Inglis and Corey Anderson guided San Francisco to a comfortable six-wicket win with 34 balls to spare.\n\nIn a must-win game, the Seattle Orcas faced a disastrous start after being invited to bat first. They lost both openers in the very first over: Ryan Rickelton was caught by Finn Allen on the first ball, and Aaron Jones was trapped LBW by Carmi le Roux.\n\nDespite an early setback, Seattle managed to score 48 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to an aggressive counter-attack by Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya. They added 34 runs in the last two overs of the Powerplay, bringing the score to 48/2.\n\nDe Kock reached his half-century off 28 balls by the 10th over. Alongside Jayasuriya, he added 31 runs off Pat Cummins' first two overs, pushing Seattle to 98/2 after 11 overs. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the 12th over as both de Kock (62 off 33) and Jayasuriya (31 off 33) were dismissed in quick succession by Brody Couch.\n\nHassan Khan then delivered a decisive blow to Seattle Orcas, as he struck thrice in his two consecutive overs. He dismissed Heinrich Klaasen (8 off 8) in the 14th over, and Harmeet Singh (3 off 7) and Keemo Paul (0 off 1) in the 16th over, reducing Seattle to 116/7.\n\nIt was Shubham Ranjane, who came to the rescue as he played a crucial unbeaten knock of 26 runs off 25 balls, helping Seattle post a total of 152/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nBrief Scores: San Francisco Unicorns (Finn Allen 77 off 30, Josh Inglis 24 off 17, Harmeet Singh 2/39) beat Seattle Orcas (Quinton de Kock 62 off 33, Shehan Jayasuriya 31 off 33, Hassan Khan 3/5) by six wickets.

        "body": "While seven other squad members are in the US competing in the Major League Cricket tournament, Temba Bavuma and Co will be getting together for the first time since the New Year’s Test at Newlands.\n\nTEST captain Temba Bavuma will be alongside Wiaan Mulder, Matthew Breetzke, Tony de Zorzi, Lungi Ngidi, Kyle Verreynne, Dane Paterson and Tristan Stubbs at Kingsmead Stadium in Durban this week as the first day of the pre-Caribbean tour camp gets under way.\n\nWhile seven other squad members are in the US competing in the Major League Cricket tournament, Bavuma and Co will be getting together for the first time since the New Year’s Test at Newlands.\n\nComing on the back of a lot of white-ball cricket recently, the objectives of the camp will be for the players to polish their red-ball skills, and remind themselves of the team’s philosophy.\n\nDespite the Proteas’ 2-0 Test series victory during their last visit to the Caribbean three years ago and the West Indies’ innings defeat to England in the first Test at Lord’s earlier this week, they are a formidable unit in their backyard.\n\n“We’re looking forward to a competitive West Indies team,” Bavuma said.\n\n“About three years ago, their bowling attack put us under pressure. I think the Duke ball in those conditions does talk a bit, it does move around and they have the resources to do that. As inexperienced as some of their players will be, we’ll still need to be on our A-game in all disciplines.\n\n“It will also be a good challenge where we also have newer faces, some inexperience within our team, to see how those guys go about their international careers within the red-ball space. That’s something that we’re looking forward to.\n\n“Every series is an important one. We don’t have the privilege of looking too far ahead with us being placed at No.7 (in the World Test Championship). It’s for us to look to play our best cricket in those conditions and take the confidence from that.\n\n“We know that winning breeds confidence and it can become a habit as well.\n\n“If we can start doing that in the West Indies, that would be good for us. But again, we’re not looking too far ahead. We want to get there, understanding that we haven’t played Test cricket for a while.\n\n“It’s about us reminding ourselves of our philosophy as a team, building that winning culture again and carrying that throughout the season.”\n\nWith Dean Elgar having called time on his career during the drawn series against India earlier this year, this means Bavuma is now the senior batter within the team with 97 innings under the belt.\n\nBavuma feels no added pressure.\n\n“It’s just an awareness in terms of knowing that you’re the senior statesman within the team and not an added pressure or anything like that,” he said.\n\n“I will still try to fulfil my role as a batter and put the team in winning positions. Nothing is going to change from that.”\n\nWith the likes of Aiden Markram and some of the Proteas T20 World Cup finalists set to join the Test side before the start of the Windies series, there will be some confidence that they will bring into the Test space.\n\n“There’s a lot of confidence that will emanate within the group seeing the success of the boys in the T20 side,” he said.\n\n“We’ll take the confidence that will come with the guys who were at the World Cup and have them lead things from that perspective.\n\n“But I think within the Test space we’re not as far ahead as the T20 players are and even the 50-over space. There are a couple of hurdles that we need to get through as a Test team.\n\n“We’re still finding ourselves, if we’re being honest. That’s really where our focus is within the Test team.”\n\nThe camp will run until Friday. The first Test is scheduled to start on August 7 in Port of Spain. It will be preceded by a warm-up match, starting on July 31."

Texas Super Kings are third with six points and will look to finish in the top two, while Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), with five points, will aim to just win their last game and qualify.\n\nThe MLC’s second season has been a big success, both on and off the pitch. The promoters’ decision to broadcast the league in India simultaneously on Sony Sports Network and JioCinema proved to be a major hit. The fact that Indian Premier League (IPL) franchisee-owned teams are being televised on the former IPL broadcasting network is a call for nostalgia, which was a big smash.\n\nMLC is rapidly becoming one of the world’s best T20 competitions, and it will undoubtedly develop more in the future. Additionally, players like Marcus Stoinis, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, Pat Cummins, Shakib Al Hasan and others are delivering their best in the competition and rightfully receiving deserving appreciation.

Shehan Jayasuriya's excellent catch sent San Francisco Unicorns batter Sanjay Krishnamurthi to the pavilion in the recent game.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns opted to bowl first at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Sunday, July 21 (India time). The Seattle Orcas scored 152 runs for the loss of seven wickets in 20 overs. Shehan Jayasuriya struggled to score runs as he was dismissed after scoring 31 runs off 33 deliveries with four boundaries.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns chased down the target with six wickets and more than five overs to spare. Opener Finn Allen scored 77 runs off 30 deliveries, including eight boundaries and six maximums. The Orcas recorded their fifth loss out of six matches in the tournament and are at the bottom of the six-team table.\n\nWatch: Shehan Jayasuriya Takes Catch of MLC 2024\n\nDuring the first ball of the 13th over of the San Francisco Unicorns' innings, Sanjay Krishnamurthi attempted a drive against a slower, wider delivery from left-arm spinner Harmeet Singh. Sanjay Krishnamurthi connected the ball but didn't get the desired elevation to go over the fielder inside the circle.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya was positioned at short cover on the field. The Sri Lankan international made a perfectly timed full-length jump to catch the ball with his outstretched right hand. Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed after scoring 10 runs off 16 balls with one boundary.\n\nWe Have Been Poor In This Season - Heinrich Klaasen\n\nThe Seattle Orcas were eliminated from the MLC 2024 after their heavy defeat to the San Francisco Unicorns. The runner-ups from the inaugural season have won only one of their first six matches. They will face the Texas Super Kings (TSK) in their final match at the Grand Prairie Stadium on Wednesday, July 24.\n\nOrcas skipper Heinrich Klaasen expressed his disappointment, noting their poor batting and lack of firepower. Klaasen acknowledged that their total was 15-20 runs short, which ultimately cost them the match.\n\n\"Disappointing, we were in the final last year, this year we didn't bat well, not a lot of firepower. The bowlers were good and did what best they could do. A bit under par, maybe 15-20 runs short and that cost us in the end. We've been poor in this season, disappointing for the franchise and the owners,\" Klaasen said.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen's team has struggled with form and finding the right combination this season. Shehan Jayasuriya has performed decently in the middle order, with his standout moment being a remarkable ramp shot against Haris Rauf in an earlier match against the San Francisco Unicorns in the MLC 2024."

        "body": "3 minute read\n\nAustralia skipper Pat Cummins has joined the party at Major League Cricket as he features for a San Francisco Unicorns side well stacked with Baggy Greens stars.\n\nCummins has a number of fellow Aussies taking part in the 20-over competition in the United States, with Washington Freedom currently leading the way inspired by Steven Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell.\n\nFreedom - 2.40 to secure the MLC title - have won all five of their completed fixtures, with a washout the only thing robbing them of a 100 per cent record, while Cummins features for a Unicorns outfit who lie second in the standings with three wins from five games.\n\nFreedom march on thanks to Aussie batters\n\nIn the most recent fixture Washington saw off Texas Super Kings by 42 runs to maintain their unbeaten record, with Smith and Head both making half-centuries at the top of the order.\n\nIt's fair to say Head dominated the partnership as he was dismissed for 53, having added 59 for the first wicket with Smith, with Maxwell later smacking three sixes in his 34 and then taking three wickets with his off-spin.\n\nHead (194) and Smith (191) have certainly been enjoying themselves with the bat, as they lie third and fourth respectively; in the runscorers' chart in MLC, with South African Faf du Plessis leading the way with 264 runs for Super Kings.\n\nDu Plessis is one of two century-makers in MLC so far this season, with fellow South African Ryan Rickelton the other player to reach three figures, for Seattle Orcas.\n\nAussie pair back up Du Plessis\n\nPlaying alongside former Proteas skipper Du Plessis at Super Kings are Baggy Greens pair Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Hardie, with the former having made more of an impression with the ball than he has with the bat so far.\n\nIn fairness, neither player has excelled to date and both will want to deliver more for their side, with 6.00 Texas currently well-placed to ensure a top-four finish and a place in the play-offs - only two of the six teams miss out on the end-of-season finale.\n\nTim David has also yet to fire for reigning champions MI New York in his three appearances, while both Alex Carey and Adam Zampa have yet to feature for Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nLeft-arm quick Spencer Johnson has sparked for the 9.00 Knight Riders, however, taking eight wickets at 19.75 in his five games to date, although that wickets tally is one less than Maxwell has snapped up for Freedom.\n\nCummins adds to the Aussie mix\n\nThat leaves us with Unicorns, who have added Cummins to a roster which already features his fellow Aussies Matt Short, Josh Inglis and Jake Fraser-McGurk and who are 3.75 to be crowned champions.\n\nShort has passed 50 twice in his four knocks so far this season in MLC, but neither Inglis nor Fraser-McGurk have made significant contributions to date, while Cummins has taken just one wicket across his two appearances.\n\nHe will want to help San Francisco make certain of a play-off place, with Unicorns having missed out during the inaugural MLC season last year, with New York eventually defeating Orcas by seven wickets in the final."

After winning the opening game of the season against the Seattle Orcas, they have lost three matches and one was washed out. This has put them fifth on the table with three points in five matches. Having not found a win in four games, MI needs to win this one to stay in contention for a top-four finish.\n\nOn the other hand, the San Francisco Unicorns are currently in the top four, in third place to be precise despite having five points in four matches.

Fast bowlers will find some movement, especially early in the inning.\n\nThe ball starts sticking to the pitch as the match proceeds, which might help medium pacers with a lot of variations. Quality spinners too can muddle the middle overs.\n\nMI New York Vs San Francisco Unicorns Weather Report\n\nThe skies will be cloudy with some chance of rain, but not too much, the winds will also hardly pick up.\n\nIt will be a warm and pleasant evening, with temperatures in the mid 20s. The humidity will also be very high.\n\nMINY Vs SFU Predicted Playing XI\n\nMI New York Predicted Playing XI\n\nSteven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Monank Patel (wk), Dewald Brevis, Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard (C), Rashid Khan, Romario Shephard, Trent Bould, Nosthush Kenjige, Ehsan Adl\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Predicted Playing XI\n\nFinn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Josh Inglis, Corey Anderson (C), Hassan Ali, Pat Cummins, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Carmi de Roux\n\nMINY Vs SFU Head To Head Record\n\nMatches Played: 01\n\nMI New York Won: 00\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Won: 01\n\nNo Result: 00\n\nFirst Played: July 14, 2023\n\nLast Played: July 14, 2023\n\nMI New York Vs San Francisco Unicorns Prediction\n\nWhile this match will be highly affected by the toss, we can not keep that in mind while making a prediction. So instead, we will look back at the recent record of these two teams, which has been fairly similar in this tournament. It is clear that both these sides do not compete with the better team this season, seeing how they have lost most of their matches by a big margin.\n\nIn their game earlier this season, the MI New York won their one and only match, this team also seems to have a better bowling attack as a whole. But, the Knight Riders have a better spin attack, giving them a distinct advantage on this dry track.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns also seem to have a better batting order, making them the favorites to win this one.\n\nMI New York Vs San Francisco Unicorns Prediction: San Francisco Unicorns will defeat MI New York in the 1st Match of Major League Cricket 2024"

        "body": "Major League Cricket 2024 is heading to its finale as the group phase matches are getting to its end. There was a massive injury scare that happened during the San Francisco Unicorns versus Seattle Orcas match.\n\nThe incident occurred when Carmi Le Roux, who was bowling to Ryan Rickelton, was hit on his head. The ball came towards the bowler at high speed and he couldn’t put up his hands on time and was hit on his head.\n\nThe rest of the players, including Ryan Rickelton, ran up to the bowler to check on his well-being. The bowler was badly injured as there was a lot of blood on his face. It was a gory sight to watch but the one positive that came out of it was that Carmi Le Roux was able to walk off the field on his own accord.\n\nMI New York on the verge of elimination\n\nMeanwhile, defending champions MI New York took on San Francisco Unicorn in a massive game on Thursday night. At the end of the game, the Unicorns managed to hold onto a three run win over the MI side.\n\nBatting first, the Unicorns scored 148/7 with skipper Corey Anderson top scoring with 59 not out. The knock came off 44 balls with four boundaries and two sixes as he added a crucial 87 runs for the 6th wicket with Hassan Khan who scored 44.\n\nChasing 149 to win, MI lost Ruben Clinton early for a duck. Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran then added 57 runs for the 2nd wicket. Dewald Brevis scored 56 runs from 36 balls before he was out to Brody Couch.\n\nMatthew Short was the best bowler with 3/27 from his 4 overs as he combined well with Hassan Khan and Brody Couch to help the Unicorns win by 3 runs. The result will have a massive bearing on the MI side who are struggling at the bottom half of the table and could miss out on the playoffs.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the game, Kieron Pollard the MI skipper said “I believe it was the middle period of 15 balls, we didn't get any boundaries and let them get back. But I think we still had a chance and didn't take it. I thought we bowled well to have them at 33 for 5, Boult bowled well, but they had a good partnership to get around 148. I think we should have restricted them to 120, I don't want to blame anyone, luck wasn't on our side at various stages of the tournament”"
