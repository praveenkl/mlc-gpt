        "date": "Mon Jul 15 04:44:00 2024",
        "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nLast season’s Major League Cricket runners’ up, the Seattle Orcas, come into this one on the back of a difficult season so far whereby they are fighting for a place in the next phase as they come up against a San Francisco Unicorns side that were thumped by the Texas Super Kings in their most recent outing.\n\nDATE & TIME: Monday 15th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:00pm / USA PT – 12:00pm / West Indies – 2:00pm / UK – 8:00pm / South Africa – 9:00pm / Tuesday 16th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:00am / India – 12:30am / Bangladesh – 1:00am / Australia – 10:00pm\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 36c or 96.8 F with clear, sunny skies\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS FORM: MUST REACT FROM THUMPING\n\nSeattle Orcas most recently suffered a hammering at the hands of an impressive Washington Freedom side at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas last week. They were bowled out for just 124 in 19.4 overs before Freedom cruised through with an eight-wicket victory. The Orcas currently sit at the bottom-of-the-table.\n\nLAST THREE: LWLLW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: MUST REACT FROM THUMPING\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns come into this one on the back of their own shaky start to the 2024 Major League Cricket season. Their most recent played match, ignoring the abandonment against the Los Angeles Knight Riders, saw them hammered by the Texas Super Kings with the Unicorns being bowled out for just 127 before TSK chased it in 12.5 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: ALWLL\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Seattle Orcas have reshuffled their top order already in this tournament with Quinton de Kock moving down to three behind Ryan Rickelton and Nauman Anwar. De Kock has been in poor form for some time now, though, and the Orcas’ best bet of getting runs has been via captain Heinrich Klaasen with Klaasen scoring 30+ seemingly always a good option.\n\nIt is a fairly weak attack that the Orcas possess with the likes of Imad Wasim, Nandre Burger, Cameron Gannon, Harmeet Singh and Zaman Khan providing little potency. That said, it is South African Burger that has often looked to be the most controlled and Burger to be the Orcas’ top bowler would be a reasonable shout.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIt is a modern day top order for the San Francisco Unicorns and it is a top order that should look to threaten most bowling attacks. Josh Inglis has been demoted down to five with Sanjay Krishnamurthi moving up but neither of those players their biggest threat. That falls on the shoulders of Matthew Short and whilst the Australian is hit and miss so 30+ is not always as likely as the aforementioned Klaasen, he is likely to be the Unicorns’ top batter in the match.\n\nHaris Rauf and Liam Plunkett are symbols of what is an ageing and actually ineffective Unicorns’ bowling attack. Abrar Ahmed appears more suited to Test cricket so the responsibility to take two or more wickets in the match is actually on Hassan Khan.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThis is a weird game because both sides found their batting line-ups totally outplayed in previous matches, both being bowled out for fairly low scores. However, their respective bowling attacks would appear to be the weakest sections of their sides on paper. That means, with a response needed from both, it could end up being a surprisingly high scoring match and if that is the case then the Unicorns’ top order should be tipped to out score their opposition most times."

        "body": "The Texas Super Kings triumphed over MI New York by 15 runs in Major League Cricket Match 12.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 12\n\nTexas Super Kings 176/6 (20 ov)\n\nMI New York 161/7 (20 ov)\n\nTexas Super Kings won by 15 runs.\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nWhat should have been a comfortable victory for the Texas Super Kings (TSK) over MI New York (MINY) turned into a tense finish after a spirited fightback by Rashid Khan and Monank Patel during their Cognizant Major League Cricket 2024 fixture at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday.\n\nChasing 177 for the win, MI New York faced early setbacks courtesy of Marcus Stoinis’ bowling onslaught. They lost three wickets in quick succession, including that of the dangerous Nicholas Pooran (1), inside the powerplay. The situation worsened when skipper Kieron Pollard (5) fell cheaply, leaving MINY at 52/5 in 11.2 overs.\n\nAt this stage, the match appeared firmly in TSK's grasp. However, Rashid Khan (50) walked out to the middle and injected much-needed energy into the innings. His aggressive approach stabilized the innings and brought out the best in Monank Patel (61). The pair found boundaries at regular intervals, turning the tide on TSK.\n\nThe duo held on to a 97-run stand for the 6th wicket, giving MINY a glimmer of hope. However, Dwayne Bravo's experience came to the fore. In the crucial 19th over, he conceded just 8 runs, which effectively sealed the game for the Texas Super Kings. Despite the late scare, TSK managed to hold their nerve and secure a 15-run win.\n\nEarlier in the day, Faf du Plessis took full advantage of the powerplay, smashing the MI New York bowlers across the field. His aggressive approach paid off with a quickfire fifty, setting a strong foundation for the Super Kings as they ended up scoring 176/6.\n\nThe breakthrough for MI New York came in the 9th over when left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was introduced into the attack. Despite being expensive, Kenjige managed to dismiss du Plessis, who was caught at long-on by Tim David while attempting another big hit, having scored 61 in 38 balls.\n\nNew Zealand’s Devon Conway provided valuable support with a handy knock before Faf’s dismissal, but he fell short of his fifty, getting dismissed for 40 by Ehsan Adil in the 14th over. The Super Kings then faced a mini-collapse, losing key wickets. Then, Marcus Stoinis stepped up towards the end with some lusty blows, propelling the Super Kings past the 175-run mark.\n\nIn the bowling department, MI New York had their moments. Rashid Khan was the standout performer, maintaining an economical spell with figures on 1/17. Trent Boult also claimed a couple of wickets but was quite expensive on the day.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-85 (Faf du Plessis - 8.5 ov), 2-121 (Devon Conway - 13.1 ov), 3-127 (Aaron Hardie - 14.1 ov), 4-138 (Joshua Tromp - 16.1 ov), 5-143 (Milind Kumar - 16.5 ov), 6-160 (Calvin Savage - 18.1 ov)\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-14 (Ruben Clinton - 1.5 ov), 2-17 (Nicholas Pooran - 2.6 ov), 3-27 (Steven Taylor - 3.5 ov), 4-39 (Kieron Pollard - 8.4 ov), 5-52 (Tim David - 11.2 ov), 6-149 (Rashid Khan - 19.2 ov), 7-157 (Monank Patel - 19.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nNaveen ul Haq\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nMI New York\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nMonank Patel\n\nTim David\n\nSteven Taylor\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nRashid Khan\n\nRuben Clinton\n\nTrent Boult\n\nKagiso Rabada\n\nEhsan Adil\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Monday, July 15, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: MI New York elected to bowl"

The Australia fast bowler, last seen in action during the T20 World Cup that took place in America and West Indies, will begin his stint with the San Francisco Unicorns midway through the season at the Major League Cricket tournament.\n\nCummins signed a four-year deal with the franchise.

He has 107 wickets from 76 T20s and is known for his variations and death-bowling ability.\n\nNgidi suffered a back injury during the SA20 at the start of the year and missed the IPL that followed but has since recovered and was part of South Africa's squad at the T20 World Cup, along with Baartman."

This impressive performance highlights Washington Freedom's strong position in the tournament.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nWashington Freedom vs Los Angeles Knight Riders, Match 11\n\nWashington Freedom 130/2 (16 ov)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders 129/10 (18.4 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom won by 8 wickets\n\nSCORECARD\n\nManhattan\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nWashington Freedom defeated Los Angeles Knight Riders by eight wickets to register their third consecutive victory of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Church Street Park, Morrisville on Sunday.\n\nWashington’s Saurabh Netravalkar (4/35) and Glen Maxwell (3/15) were exceptional with the ball, ensuring the Los Angeles Knight Riders were restricted to 129/10. In the second innings, a hard-hitting knock from Travis Head (54) and a composed innings from Steven Smith (42*), helped the Washington Freedom romp home with four overs to spare.\n\nThe Washington Freedom dominated the run chase from the outset. Openers Travis Head and Steven Smith ensured an explosive powerplay, with Head clearing the ropes effortlessly. By the end of six overs, Washington Freedom were well ahead at 61/0. While Steven Smith batted cautiously, Travis Head reached his half-century in just 27 balls, including six maximums. However, Shadley Van Schalkwyk broke the 79-run partnership by dismissing Head in the ninth over.\n\nRachin Ravindra (11) then joined Steven Smith, who began to accelerate, adding 29 runs together. However, the pace and bounce of Spencer Johnson deceived Ravindra in the 13th over, leaving the score at 109/2. Andries Gous (15) and Steven Smith comfortably saw the team through the remainder of the innings, finishing at 130/2 in just 16 overs.\n\nEarlier in the day, the LA Knight Riders’ innings began disastrously, as they found themselves at 39/4 during a tempestuous powerplay. Saurabh Netravalkar struck early, removing Sunil Narine (0) and Unmukt Chand (1) in the second over. The collapse continued with Shakib Al Hasan (0) bowled by Glenn Maxwell and Jason Roy (12) dismissed by Lockie Ferguson.\n\nAttempting to stabilize the innings, Nitish Kumar(11) and Saif Badar (35) forged a 44-run partnership. Badar counter-attacked, taking 17 runs off Netravalkar in one over, including two consecutive sixes, during his 35-run knock. However, both batsmen fell in quick succession—Badar to Ravindra and Kumar to Maxwell.\n\nAndre Russell looked dangerous, smashing 20 runs off just 12 deliveries before Maxwell claimed him as his third wicket of the day. The very next over saw Lockie Ferguson dismiss David Miller (1), leaving the Los Angeles Knight Riders struggling at 89/8 in 13.1 overs.\n\nThe tail-enders fought valiantly to push the score to a competitive total. Shadley van Schalkwyk remained unbeaten on 12*, while Spencer Johnson (16) and Ali Khan (11) added crucial runs before Netravalkar returned to wrap up the innings with two more wickets. The LA Knight Riders were bowled out for 129 in 18.4 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Fall of wickets: 1-10 (Sunil Narine - 1.1 ov), 2-12 (Unmukt Chand - 1.6 ov), 3-13 (Shakib Al Hasan - 2.3 ov), 4-18 (Jason Roy - 4.2 ov), 5-62 (Saif Badar - 9.4 ov), 6-66 (Nitish Kumar - 10.2 ov), 7-87 (Andre Russell - 12.3 ov), 8-89 (David Miller - 13.1 ov), 9-107 (Spencer Johnson - 15.3 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-79 (Travis Head - 8.2 ov), 2-108 (Rachin Ravindra - 12.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nTravis Head\n\nSteven Smith\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nIan Holland\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nUnmukt Chand(WK)\n\nDavid Miller\n\nJason Roy\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nSaif Badar\n\nShakib Al Hasan\n\nAndre Russell\n\nShadley van Schalkwyk\n\nSunil Narine(C)\n\nAli Khan\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Sunday, July 14, 2024 20:30\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville"

Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nSteven Smith the skipper of Washington Freedom says they have been looking for a complete show and this was close to it. Adds they bowled well, and fielded well and it was a dominant chase. Says it was his gut feeling due to which he made the bowling changes, informs Maxwell wasn’t going to bowl but they went with it and he did well. Says they wanted to be positive with the bat and that happened. Adds Head takes the pressure off and he’s batted really well again.\n\nSunil Narine the skipper of Los Angeles Knight Riders says he can’t complain about the toss. Mentions they needed early wickets and did not get it. Adds they need to back their players and he feels his players are still up for it. Ends by saying they were thinking about wickets but that was not the case and now they need to do well in the next games.\n\nGlenn Maxwell is the Player of the Match. He says he’s pleased with his effort. He’s happy to keep the runs down and get the wickets. Adds he’s happy with how the team has played so far. Mentions it is good to get some purchase from the wicket. Mentions he’s enjoying not batting and he hopes when his time comes, he can do well.

Adds it was good to spend some time in the middle and he is happy to play the way he did. Mentions it was good to get a few out of the middle and he's pleased with how he batted. Ends by saying he's looking forward to the next games.\n\nEarlier in the game, it was a poor batting performance from the Los Angeles Knight Riders, with only Badar showing resilience while other batters failed to stay at the crease. The team's aggressive approach backfired on a challenging wicket, resulting in soft dismissals and a low total of 129. Netravalkar and the spinners bowled well to keep the pressure on Los Angeles Knight Riders throughout the innings.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders just did not have enough on the board! They created a few chances but it just did not go their way. They though will be disappointed for the speed at which they let their opposition score the runs. They were completely outplayed by much better side on the day.\n\nA thumping win then for Washington Freedom and they remain unbeaten. 130 was never going to be a challenge for them. Yes, they had a bit of luck at the start but their openers provided them the perfect opening. Head and Ravindra fell quickly but Smith and Andries Gous ensured there were no more wickets to fall and took their side over the line.\n\n4\n\nOvers15.4\n\nScore129 - 2\n\nShakib Al Hasan to Andries Gous, FOUR! Up and over! Fuller and on middle. This is hit down the ground and to the long on fence. The scores are level now!\n\nW\n\nOvers12.5\n\nScore108 - 2\n\nSpencer Johnson to Rachin Ravindra, OUT! Taken! That is a very good catch! Shorter and outside off. This is slapped towards cover. The fielder runs in and takes it inches above the ground.\n\n4\n\nOvers10.2\n\nScore94 - 1\n\nShadley van Schalkwyk to Steven Smith, FOUR MORE! Nice and fine! On the pads.

Faf du Plessis-led side has won two games, lost one and one of their games was abandoned.\n\nChasing a target of 177, MI New York faced early setbacks due to Marcus Stoinis' devastating bowling spell. They lost three crucial wickets in quick succession, including that of the dangerous Nicholas Pooran (1), all within the powerplay. The situation worsened when skipper Kieron Pollard (5) fell cheaply, leaving MINY reeling at 52/5 in 11.2 overs.\n\nAt this stage, the match appeared firmly in TSK's grasp. However, Rashid Khan (50) stepped onto the field and injected much-needed energy into the innings. His aggressive approach stabilized the innings and brought out the best in Monank Patel (61). The pair found boundaries at regular intervals, turning the tide against TSK.\n\nThe duo held on for a 97-run stand for the 6th wicket, giving MINY a glimmer of hope. However, Dwayne Bravo's experience came to the fore in the crucial 19th over, where he conceded just 8 runs, effectively sealing the game for the Texas Super Kings. Despite the late scare, TSK held their nerve and secured a 15-run win.\n\nEarlier in the day, Faf du Plessis capitalized on the powerplay, smashing the MI New York bowlers across the field. His aggressive approach paid off with a quickfire fifty, setting a strong foundation for the Super Kings, scoring 176/6.\n\nThe breakthrough for MI New York came in the 9th over when left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was introduced into the attack. Despite being expensive, Kenjige managed to dismiss du Plessis, who was caught at long-on by Tim David while attempting another big hit, having scored 61 in 38 balls.\n\nNew Zealand's Devon Conway provided valuable support with a handy knock before Faf's dismissal, but he fell short of his fifty, getting dismissed for 40 by Ehsan Adil in the 14th over. The Super Kings then faced a mini-collapse, losing key wickets, but Marcus Stoinis stepped up towards the end with some powerful shots, propelling the Super Kings past the 175-run mark.\n\nIn the bowling department, MI New York had their moments. Rashid Khan was the standout performer, maintaining an economical spell with figures of 1/17. Trent Boult also claimed a couple of wickets but was quite expensive on the day."

In the second innings, a hard-hitting knock from Travis Head (54) and a composed innings from Steven Smith (42*), helped the Washington Freedom romp home with four overs to spare.\n\nThe Washington Freedom dominated the run chase from the outset. Openers Travis Head and Steven Smith ensured an explosive powerplay, with Head clearing the ropes effortlessly. By the end of six overs, Washington Freedom was well ahead at 61/0. While Steven Smith batted cautiously, Travis Head reached his half-century in just 27 balls, including six maximums. However, Shadley Van Schalkwyk broke the 79-run partnership by dismissing Head in the ninth over.\n\nRachin Ravindra (11) then joined Steven Smith, who began to accelerate, adding 29 runs together. However, the pace and bounce of Spencer Johnson deceived Ravindra in the 13th over, leaving the score at 109/2. Andries Gous (15) and Steven Smith comfortably saw the team through the remainder of the innings, finishing at 130/2 in just 16 overs.\n\nEarlier in the day, the LA Knight Riders’ innings began disastrously, as they found themselves at 39/4 during a tempestuous powerplay. Saurabh Netravalkar struck early, removing Sunil Narine (0) and Unmukt Chand (1) in the second over. The collapse continued with Shakib Al Hasan (0) bowled by Glenn Maxwell and Jason Roy (12) dismissed by Lockie Ferguson.\n\nAttempting to stabilize the innings, Nitish Kumar(11) and Saif Badar (35) forged a 44-run partnership. Badar counter-attacked, taking 17 runs off Netravalkar in one over, including two consecutive sixes, during his 35-run knock. However, both batsmen fell in quick succession—Badar to Ravindra and Kumar to Maxwell.\n\nAndre Russell looked dangerous, smashing 20 runs off just 12 deliveries before Maxwell claimed him as his third wicket of the day. The very next over saw Lockie Ferguson dismiss David Miller (1), leaving the Los Angeles Knight Riders struggling at 89/8 in 13.1 overs.\n\nThe tail-enders fought valiantly to push the score to a competitive total. Shadley van Schalkwyk remained unbeaten on 12*, while Spencer Johnson (16) and Ali Khan (11) added crucial runs before Netravalkar returned to wrap up the innings with two more wickets. The LA Knight Riders were bowled out for 129 in 18.4 overs."

        "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 is about to witness a significant boost as Australian skipper Pat Cummins is set to join the San Francisco Unicorns. The 31-year-old speedster is no stranger to American soil, having recently participated in the T20 World Cup held in the USA and West Indies.\n\nCummins' commitment to the San Francisco Unicorns is substantial, with a four-year deal in place. This move is particularly noteworthy as Cummins has limited experience in overseas T20 leagues, having only played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) previously. The right-arm pacer picked 18 wickets in 16 games at an average of 31.44 and an economy of 9.27 in this edition of the cash-rich league.\n\nHis last appearance in Australia's domestic T20 competition, the Big Bash League, dates back to the 2018-19 season, primarily due to his international commitments.\n\nThe timing of Cummins' arrival couldn't be better for the Unicorns, who have struggled this season with only one victory in three matches. The pacer's recent form has been exceptional, including his historic back-to-back hat-tricks in the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nAlso read: How Pat Cummins’ love for technology lured him to Major League Cricket\n\nHis leadership skills were also on display when he guided Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL final. With an impressive T20 record of 172 wickets in 151 matches at an average of 26.66 and an economy rate of 8.11, Cummins is expected to significantly bolster the Unicorns' bowling arsenal.\n\nThe Australian skipper's addition to the team also witnesses the departure of West Indies all-rounder Sherfane Rutherford, who is unable to continue in the MLC due to a family bereavement. This personnel change is likely to alter the team's dynamics and strategy in the upcoming matches.\n\nOther teams also have made changes in their squad, with Ottneil Baartman replacing Gerald Coetzee (injury) at Texas Super Kings and Lungi Ngidi coming in for Wayne Parnell (player withdrawal) at Seattle Orcas."

On the other hand, San Francisco holds the fourth position and has won one game in three matches, with a negative NRR of 0.631.\n\nOrcas are coming off a five-wicket-defeat against table-toppers Washington Freedom.

However, a key concern is the batting tempo in the second innings, as the ball's pace slows down upon hitting the surface. This gives bowlers an advantage, allowing them to capitalize on uneven bounce.

The game against Washington Freedom that was washed out also saw a strong performance with the bat, with Faf du Plessis scoring a century.\n\nThey have a very strong squad at their disposal though with Conway partnering Faf at the top of the order and the Australian all-rounder duo of Aaron Hardie-Marcus Stoinis form the backbone of the team. They have the quality and experience of Dwayne Bravo too along with the likes of Naveen-ul-Haq and Mohammad Mohsin also showed his talent in the last game with a stunning four-wicket haul.\n\nSo, with all bases covered, let's see how Super Kings go about their business against the might of MI New York.\n\nMI New York\n\nThe defending champions are a star-studded unit and started off the tournament with a bang, by destroying Seattle Orcas. Their bowling comprises of the likes of Trent Boult, Anrich Nortje and Rashid Khan who are match-winners on their day, while on the batting front, they have the power-hitting trio of Nicholas Pooran, Tim David and captain Kieron Pollard.\n\nThere is a strong local talent as well with Ruben Clinton and Monank Patel at the top of the order and if they all fire in unison, MI New York can be a very hard team to beat.

        "date": "Mon Jul 15 11:50:07 2024",
        "body": "The Major League Cricket 2024 is going on in the USA, with popular players from different nations joining in the play. The tournament started on 5 July, 2024, the day after USA celebrated its independence and will go on until 28 July. While the season is midway, Australia‘s star cricketer Pat Cummins is set to join San Francisco Unicorns in MLC.\n\nCummins signed a four-year deal with the franchise. The 31-year-old has mainly played in the IPL among overseas T20 leagues and has been absent from Australia’s Big Bash League since the 2018–19 season due to his international commitments.\n\nCummins joins the San Francisco Unicorns midway during the MLC\n\nPat Cummins is set to return to the USA for the MLC 2024. Cummins played the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 in the USA and West Indies for Australia. Cummins’ arrival comes as Sherfane Rutherford departs. The hard-hitting West Indies allrounder, who has not participated in any of the Unicorns’ matches this season, will miss the rest of the Major League Cricket (MLC) due to a bereavement in his family.\n\nThis change marks a significant shift for the team, which hopes Cummins will fill the gap left by Rutherford’s absence.\n\nOther teams in the MLC are also experiencing roster changes. Ottneil Baartman will replace Gerald Coetzee in the Texas Super Kings. Gerald is sidelined due to an injury.\n\nBaartman’s inclusion is to bolster the team’s bowling attack as they navigate through the remainder of the season. Coetzee’s injury has been a setback, but the team is optimistic about Baartman’s potential contributions.\n\nSimilarly, the Seattle Orcas have made a key substitution, with Lungi Ngidi taking over from Wayne Parnell, who withdrew from the tournament.\n\nNgidi’s addition is a strategic move to strengthen the Orcas’ lineup. Parnell’s withdrawal required a swift response, and the team believes Ngidi’s experience and skills will be crucial in maintaining their competitive edge as they advance in the MLC.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns look for a fate change\n\nPat Cummins’ arrival in the team is expected to mark the comeback for the San Francisco Unicorns. The Unicorns have won just one of their three games this year, and they will benefit greatly from the addition of Cummins.\n\nKnown for his impressive performances, Cummins made history by securing back-to-back hat-tricks at the T20 World Cup. Before that, he led Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL final.\n\nHis experience and skill will help provide a much-needed boost to the team. Sun Risers Hyderabad got to the IPL 2024 finals but lost the season to Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nCummins brings a wealth of experience, having played 151 T20 matches and taken 172 wickets with an average of 26.66 and an economy rate of 8.11.\n\nHis consistent performance in T20 cricket makes him a valuable asset for the Unicorns. The team hopes his presence will enhance their bowling attack and improve their standings as the season progresses."

        "body": "Washington Freedom extended their unbeaten run in Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 with a comprehensive eight wicket victory over Los Angeles Knight Riders in Morrisville. Opting to bowl first on a slow pitch, Freedom’s bowlers capitalized on the conditions, restricting Knight Riders to a modest total of 129.\n\nThe decision to bowl first proved to be a masterstroke, as the pitch offered just enough assistance to keep the Knight Riders batters in check, leading to a comfortable chase for Freedom.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar’s bowling masterclass\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar, who had been a standout performer in the recent T20 World Cup, showcased his prowess with a phenomenal spell, returning figures of 4/35. He struck twice in his opening over, removing Sunil Narine with a perfect full length delivery that knocked over his stumps and Unmukt Chand with a short pitched ball.\n\nBy the fifth over, Knight Riders were reeling at 18/4, with Jason Roy and Shakib Al Hasan also back in the pavilion. Roy was caught at deep midwicket trying to clear the boundary, while Shakib was bowled through the gate by a beautifully disguised slower ball. Saif Badar attempted to stabilize the innings with a cautious 35, playing some elegant shots and rotating the strike effectively. However, his dismissal – trapped LBW by a skidding delivery from Rachin Ravindra – triggered another collapse.\n\nAlso READ: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024: Complete squads of all six teams\n\nSteve Smith’s remarkable catch off Glenn Maxwell’s bowling\n\nGlenn Maxwell then tightened the screws with his accurate off-spin, finishing with figures of 3/15. His spell included the crucial wicket of Andre Russell, who looked dangerous during his brief stay at the crease. Russell, trying to accelerate the scoring, was caught at long-on, failing to clear the boundary. And then, Steve Smith‘s exceptional fielding claimed the wicket of Nitish Kumar.\n\nOn the third ball of the eleventh over, Maxwell bowled a delivery pitched on a length at middle stump. Nitish attempted to clear the ropes but failed to achieve the desired elevation. The ball went towards short mid-wicket, where Smith timed his jump perfectly and took a stunning airborne catch.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nPowerful batting seals the win for Washington Freedom\n\nAfter that Lockie Ferguson added to the pressure with his express pace, taking two wickets in quick succession, ensuring that LAKR folded with eight balls left in their innings.\n\nIn the chase, Travis Head and captain Smith provided a solid start, amassing 61 runs in the powerplay. Head was particularly aggressive, scoring 40 off just 23 balls, smashing six sixes in his 32-ball 54. Despite his dismissal, which led to a slight dip in the scoring rate, Smith anchored the innings with an unbeaten 42. His composed knock ensured that Freedom chased down the target comfortably, with eight wickets and four overs to spare, maintaining their perfect start to the season."

        "body": "Australia superstar Steve Smith is currently plying his trade for Washington Freedom in the ongoing second season of the Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nThe tournament marked his return to competitive cricket as a player after a long time. Steve Smith had not played a competitive game since the Christchurch Test against New Zealand in March. He did not play in the IPL as he was not picked up by any franchise in the auction but he did ply his trade as a commentator. The right-handed batsman was also not a part of Australia's squad for the T20 World Cup last month.\n\nHe finally returned to action earlier this month in the ongoing MLC 2024. The former Australia skipper has looked in good touch with the bat so far. And on Sunday (July 14), he once again showed that he is still one of the sharpest fielders in the game as he pulled off a stunning catch during the game between Washington Freedom and Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nOn the second ball of the 11th over, Glenn Maxwell bowled a flighted delivery on the pads to Nitish Kumar and the Knight Riders batter decided to hit the ball through the mid-wicket area. However, the USA batter failed to keep his shot down and paid a price for it as Steve Smith came up with a brilliant effort to catch the ball and send him back.\n\nWatch the catch from Steve Smith:\n\nTalking about the game, Washington Freedom thrashed the Knight Riders by 8 wickets. Asked to bat first, the Knight Riders were bowled out for just 129 runs. At one stage, they were reeling at 89 for 8 before the lower-order players guided them to a respectable total."

From the format of the game to the specific conditions of the pitch and weather, each aspect plays a crucial role in determining the outcome. Here are some free tips to help you make informed decisions for this match.\n\nPitch Condition: The nature of the pitch at Grand Prairie Stadium can greatly influence the match. If the pitch is grassy, it will favor fast bowlers, giving MI New York’s experienced pacers like Trent Boult an edge. Conversely, a dry surface can benefit spinners, impacting Texas Super Kings’ strategy.\n\nWeather & Overhead Conditions: Cloudy skies can assist swing bowlers, making it tougher for batsmen to score. Keep an eye on the weather forecast, as overcast conditions can make batting difficult, potentially giving the bowling side an advantage.\n\nTeam Composition: Evaluate the balance of each team. MI New York’s mix of hard-hitting batsmen and seasoned bowlers might give them an upper hand. Texas Super Kings will need to optimize their all-rounders and middle-order batsmen to counter this.\n\nHead-to-Head Records: Historical performance between the two teams shows MI New York has often had the upper hand. Understanding these past encounters can provide insights into possible outcomes and key matchups to watch.\n\nInnings Progress: In T20 matches, the state of an innings is crucial. If Texas Super Kings lose early wickets, it could severely limit their scoring potential, whereas building strong partnerships will be essential for setting a competitive target or chasing down a score.\n\nThese tips are designed to offer a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play, helping you make more educated predictions for the Texas Super Kings vs MI New York match.\n\nBetting Calculator\n\nBet Amount\n\nNot Valid Amount!\n\nAmerican Odds\n\nNot Valid Odds!\n\nDecimal Odds\n\nNot Valid Odds!\n\nFractional Odds\n\nNot Valid Odds!\n\nTO WIN\n\n$ 0.00\n\nPAYOUT\n\n$ 0.00\n\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York Prediction 2024\n\nBased on the Texas Super Kings vs MI New York odds and current form, MI New York is likely to win this match.

        "date": "",
        "body": "During the Major League Cricket match between the Los Angeles Knight Riders and Washington Freedom at Church Street Park in Morrisville on Sunday, Andre Russell delivered a powerful ball that struck Travis Head’s bat with such force it broke the bat in two. Despite this, Head showed incredible resilience, continuing his impressive performance to score 54 runs off just 32 balls, hitting 2 fours and 6 sixes.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders, having been sent in to bat by Washington Freedom’s captain Steve Smith, managed to score only 129 runs in 18.4 overs. This was largely due to superb bowling by Saurabh Netravalkar, who took 4 wickets for 35 runs, and Glenn Maxwell, who took 3 wickets for 15 runs.\n\nWhile chasing the target of 130 runs, Washington Freedom’s openers Head and Smith provided a strong start with a partnership of 79 runs, making the run-chase easy. However, in the second over of their innings, Russell bowled a fast, short-pitched delivery that broke Head’s bat into two pieces as he attempted a pull shot. The ball hit the upper part of the bat, leaving Head with just the handle while the rest of the bat flew towards mid-wicket.\n\nThis unexpected incident left Head visibly surprised, and his reaction went viral on social media. Nonetheless, Head went on to score 54 runs off 32 balls, helping Washington Freedom secure a magnificent eight-wicket win.\n\nAfter the match, Head commented, “The pitch was on the slower side and took more spin than previous games. It was nice to get a few good shots and secure a win. It felt great to play the entire match and get some luck. The crowd’s energy was amazing, and it helped us maximize our performance when Smithy and I were batting. I’m looking forward to the rest of the tournament.”"

Fixtures\n\nMajor League Cricket Teams\n\nReady to dive into the action with the best Major League Cricket betting sites? Here, we give the lowdown on all the MLC 2024 teams, including their strengths and weaknesses, to enable you to place more informed bets on the tournament. Importantly, to stay abreast of the latest news and team updates, check out this space on ESPNcricinfo.\n\n1. MI New York\n\nCaptain: Kieron Pollard\n\nOverseas players: Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran and Romario Shepherd (West Indies), Kagiso Rabada, Dewald Brevis and Anrich Nortje (South Africa), Tim David (Australia), Rashid Khan (Afghanistan), Trent Boult (New Zealand)\n\n2023 Standing: Champion\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Nicholas Pooran (388)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Trent Boult (22)\n\nKey players: Nicholas Pooran, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan\n\nTeam analysis: The defending champions have the most balanced squad on paper, which consists of several hard hitters, quality pacers, and a spin wizard in Rashid Khan. They have retained most of their core squad from last season and have also roped in USA national team captain Monank Patel. They are the frontrunners to retain the trophy for the second successive season.\n\n2. Los Angeles Knight Riders\n\nCaptain: Sunil Narine\n\nOverseas players: Spencer Johnson and Alex Carry (Australia), Jason Roy (England), Sunil Narine and Andre Russell (West Indies), Shakib Al Hasan (Bangladesh), Waqar Salamkheil (Afghanistan), Joshua Little (Ireland), David Miller (South Africa)\n\n2023 Standing: Last\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Andre Russell (206)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Adam Zampa (9)\n\nKey players: Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Ali Khan\n\nTeam analysis: They had a disappointing season last year, finishing at the bottom of the table and winning only one match. This year, however, they have made some good signings. Most of their overseas players are in great form, with many of them winning T20 leagues around the world. With a perfect combination of aggressive batters, all-rounders, and domestic talent, they have a great chance of turning things around and becoming the Major League Cricket champions in 2024.\n\n3. Washington Freedom\n\nCaptain: Steve Smith\n\nOverseas players: Marco Jansen (South Africa), Lockie Ferguson and Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand), Akeal Hosein (West Indies),\n\nSteve Smith, Jack Edwards, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Andrew Tye (Australia)\n\n2023 Standing: 3rd\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Matthew Short (152)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Saurabh Netravalkar (10)\n\nKey players: Saurabh Netravalkar, Akeal Hosein, Travis Head\n\nTeam analysis: Washington Freedom came in third last season, losing to MI New York in the eliminator. In a total revamp, they have filled their squad with bona fide T20 stars, including as many as five Australians who can destroy any opponent on a given day. With the induction of Lockie Ferguson, Andrew Tye, and Akeal Hosein, they have also bolstered their bowling lineup. Importantly, they also have an excellent domestic crop of players.\n\n4. San Francisco Unicorns\n\nCaptain: Corey Anderson\n\nOverseas players: Finn Allen and Matt Henry (New Zealand), Haris Rauf and Abrar Ahmed (Pakistan), Sherfane Rutherford (West Indies), Matthew Short, Josh Inglis, Pat Cummins and Jake Fraser-McGurk (Australia)\n\n2023 Standing: 5th\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Corey Anderson (190)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Liam Plunkett (7)\n\nKey players: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Sherfane Rutherford, Pat Cummins\n\nTeam analysis: Having finished fifth last season, the San Francisco Unicorns have made some sweeping changes to their overseas roster. They have got all their bases covered this season, signing aggressive openers, excellent middle-order batters, and T20 specialist pacers in their ranks. However, when it comes to their domestic recruits, the team does look slightly weak on paper.\n\n5. Texas Super Kings\n\nCaptain: Faf du Plessis\n\nOverseas players: Faf du Plessis and Aiden Markram (South Africa), Dwayne Bravo (West Indies), Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner (New Zealand), Noor Ahmad and Naveen ul Haq (Afghanistan), Marcus Stoinis (Australia), Matheesha Pathirana (Sri Lanka)\n\n2023 Standing: 2nd\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Devon Conway (221)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Mohammad Mohsin (9)\n\nKey players: Mohammad Mohsin, Marcus Stoinis, Faf du Plessis\n\nTeam analysis: A star-studded side with quality players, the Texas Super Kings came in second in the group stage last year, eventually losing to MI New York in the challenger. They have an excellent bowling lineup; however, they seem to have missed the bus when it comes to choosing their batsmen. With Devon Conway an uncertain starter due to his injury, they hardly have any T20 specialist batters this time around.\n\n6. Seattle Orcas\n\nCaptain: Wayne Parnell\n\nOverseas players: Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, Wayne Parnell, Nandre Burger and Ryan Rickelton (South Africa), Zaman Khan and Imad Wasim (Pakistan), Obed McCoy (West Indies), Michael Bracewell (New Zealand)\n\n2023 Standing: Runner-up\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Quinton de Kock (264)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Cameron Gannon (11)\n\nKey players: Heinrich Klaasen, Cameron Gannon, Imad Wasim\n\nTeam analysis: The 2023 Major League Cricket runner-up, the Seattle Orcas had to let go of many overseas players this time. Yes, they have a good bowling department, but their batters, barring Heinrich Klaasen, are either not in form or at the tail end of their careers. Everything considered, we do not expect the Orcas to reach the playoffs.\n\nMajor League Cricket (2024): Overview\n\nThe 2024 MLC (also called the Cognizant Major League Cricket for sponsorship reasons) is only the second edition of this franchise T20 cricket league, and will be held from (IST) July 6 – 29, 2024.\n\nThe league was established by the American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in the United States in 2019. The first season of the competition was played in 2023.\n\nMuch like the previous season, the 2024 chapter of the Major League Cricket will be hosted across two venues: Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas (Texas) and Church Street Park in Morrisville (North Carolina).\n\nIn May 2024, MLC announced it had obtained a List A status (one of the three major forms of the sport recognised by the ICC) for all the fixtures in the tournament.\n\nA total of six teams will participate in the competition: Los Angeles Knight Riders (captained by Sunil Narine), MI New York (Kieron Pollard), San Francisco Unicorns (Pat Cummins), Seattle Orcas (Wayne Parnell), Texas Super Kings (Faf du Plessis), and Washington Freedom (captain TBD).\n\nThe tournament will follow this structure: a total of 21 round-robin matches, followed by the playoffs.\n\nThere will be three playoff matches: eliminator (3rd vs 4th), followed by a qualifier (1st vs 2nd, the team that wins qualifies for the final), and finally the challenger (the loser of the qualifier meets the winner of the eliminator, with the winner going to the final).\n\nThe final will be played on July 29 (IST).\n\nEach team can choose a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 19 players in its squad, including a maximum of nine overseas players.\n\nMI New York are the defending champions, having won the inaugural MLC season in 2023.\n\nNicholas Pooran (388) and Trent Boult (22) are the tournament's top run-getter and wicket-taker, respectively. Both play for MI New York.\n\nHow To Bet on The Major League Cricket\n\nStep 1: Choose your preferred MLC betting site from the bookmakers we've recommended here.\n\nStep 2: Click on ‘Sign Up’ or ‘Register’.\n\nStep 3: Fill in your personal details, set a username and password, and click on ‘Submit'.\n\nStep 4: Your betting account is now ready.\n\nStep 5: Now, log in and don’t forget to claim your sports welcome bonus.\n\nStep 6: Choose ‘Cricket' from the sportsbook and then select the Major League Cricket match you wish to bet on.\n\nStep 7: Choose a suitable betting market for that game, look for the best odds, and place your wager.\n\nMajor League Cricket: Best Live Betting Sites\n\n1. Melbet\n\nWith multiple live betting markets available for every game, Melbet is widely preferred for live betting on the Major League Cricket. The intuitive interface adds to the convenience; the cash-out option gives you control over your bets; and the high-quality livestreaming feature has a multi-view option that lets you stream several matches simultaneously.\n\nThat said, the absence of a quick-bet feature is a bit of a letdown.\n\n2. 10CRIC\n\nThe bookmaker arguably offers the most competitive odds for pre-match wagers across tournaments, but is equally adept if you wish to place live bets. The 10CRIC sportsbook is tailored to cricket betting and Indians, with competitive in-play odds, an excellent live betting interface that neither lags nor takes time to update, and a mix of several in-play markets to choose from. The cash-out option comes in handy as well.\n\nRegrettably, the bookmaker does not offer livestreaming as of the day of writing. That said, you find detailed match statistics and a seamless ball-by-ball live simulation, both of which are helpful in their own right.\n\n3. Parimatch\n\nThe Parimatch live betting interface is definitely better than decent. You can watch live action, make quick analyses of events, and place your bets on the game while it's still unfolding in the middle. The live betting odds also update promptly and without any interruption, contributing positively to the overall experience.\n\nHowever, much like 10CRIC, Parimatch does not have a livestreaming option at this time. But the platform somewhat makes up for it by providing exhaustive match statistics and a ball-by-ball live simulation.\n\nMajor League Cricket: Popular Betting Markets\n\nMatch Winner: Predict the winner of any MLC game.\n\nTop Team Batsman: Predict who you think will be the top runscorer for his team in any match.\n\nTop Team Bowler: Predict who you think will be the top wicket-taker for his team in any match.\n\nPlayer of the Match: Predict who you think will be the Man of the Match in a particular game.\n\n1st Dismissal Method: Bet on the way the first batsman in an innings will be dismissed.\n\nFirst Ball of the Match: Bet on the outcome of the first ball of the game.\n\nTo Score 50+ Runs: ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ if you think any batsman will score a half century or more in a game.\n\nTo Score 100 Runs: ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ if you think any batsman will score a century in a game.\n\nMost Boundaries: Bet on the team or player who will hit the most boundaries in a game.\n\nMost Sixes: Bet on the team or player who will hit the most sixes in a game.\n\nMajor League Cricket 2024 Schedule\n\nBelow is the full Major League Cricket schedule for 2024.
