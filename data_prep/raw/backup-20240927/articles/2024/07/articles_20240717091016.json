        "body": "Earlier this year, the World Cup-winning Australia captain confirmed that he had signed a deal to play in the second season of Major League Cricket in the USA, with the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nCummins missed the side's first three matches as he took an extended rest following the 2024 T20 World Cup, which saw Australia fail to make the semifinals. He arrived in time to make his MLC debut in the Unicorns' fourth match of the campaign, against Seattle Orcas.\n\nSan Francisco batted first and scored 165-7. Matthew Short top-scored with a solid 56, and quickfire contributions came from Finn Allen (34) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (30). Cummins batted at No.8, and remained not out on six.\n\nIn the run chase, Seattle had made a sedate start, getting to 22-0 in 4 overs. Cummins came on to bowl the fifth over, and started with a fullish off-cutter on leg-stump. Left-hander Ryan Rickleton duly obliged the loosener, swinging through the line and sending the ball over long-on to welcome Cummins.\n\nThe over ended up going for 14 runs. Cummins did recover, though, and finished with 1-35 from his four overs, dismissing Shehan Jayasuriya in the 11th over. San Francisco ended up winning by 23 runs, with Liam Plunkett named Player of the Match for his 3-26.\n\nWatch Pat Cummins get hit for six off his first ball in Major League Cricket here"

        "body": "Right then, this is it from Match number 13 where the momentum shifted back and forth in favor of both sides, but eventually, it was the San Francisco Unicorns who held their nerves and emerged victorious. Up next in the Major League Cricket, 2024 is another exciting clash in Match number 14. It will be MI New York going tooth and nail against Washington Freedom at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas. That game will be played on July 17th, Wednesday and the first ball will be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT). Till then take care, and cheers!\n\nCorey Anderson, the victorious skipper of San Francisco Unicorns says that it was a good outing overall. Says that the new ball came on nicely but mentions that when it slowed down, it got tough to play the strokes. Appreciates Sanjay Krishnamurthi and says that he is a young lad and he played a good crucial cameo. On Pat Cummins, he says that Cummins is a world class player and just to have him in the group is a huge luxury. Adds they will plan how to plan the next game at Dallas and would look to get on a roll now.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, the captain of Seattle Orcas says that they didn't bat well once again and lost key players at the back end. Says they need to close games out responsibly. Says the bowlers have been fantastic but the batters need to step up big time. He says a win here and there can hopefully flip things for them.\n\nLiam Plunkett wins the PLAYER OF THE MATCH Award for his brilliant bowling figures (4-0-26-3). He says that the way the Seattle Orcas batted inside the powerplay, it looked like going one way but after the break, they came back strongly. Adds it got more and more tough to get along as the ball got older. Ends up saying it was all about trying to execute their plans and maximizing that phase.\n\nMatthew Short is in for a chat. He says that it felt nice to bat there. Adds that he feels good about batting in the first six overs. Mentions that Ryan Rickelton and Quinton de Kock were in form but the wicket was in his favour. Says that Rickelton was in fine form but thinks the wicket was spinning and was a bit skiddy as well. Adds they have been a bit unlucky with the rain. Says in a short tournament like this, every game is critical. Says that they are looking forward to their following games and will look to win them.\n\nEarlier in the game, the Unicorns were asked to bat first and had a bit of a rocky start. JFM was gone in a flash, but then Matthew Short and Finn Allen teamed up for a fireworks display, smashing 75 runs together and sending the score rocketing. But the game twisted as both fell in quick succession and suddenly the boundaries dried up. Cameron Gannon and Imad Wasim spotted their chance and pounced. While their teammates were getting a bit of a hammering. They snagged three wickets each, tightening the screws on the Unicorns' innings. Just when it looked like the Unicorns might fizzle out, Krishnamurthy charged in for some last-minute heroics. His late blitz helped push the total to a respectable 165, which realistically made the difference in the end.\n\nOn the flip side, the Unicorns must have felt that they were short of 10-15 runs. They needed a wicket desperately but couldn't get any breakthrough inside the restrictions. As many as six bowlers were used in the powerplay but they couldn't find that scalp. But the tide turned dramatically when Plunkett finally cracked the code, grabbing the first wicket. Short quickly followed suit, and then Cummins, despite leaking runs, struck gold by dismissing the well-set Jayasuriya. This trio of wickets swung the momentum, with the Unicorns cleverly using slower deliveries to keep the Orcas off-balance. The bowlers then literally ran through the opposition lineup giving away next to nothing and closed up in fine fashion.\n\nHowever, as the innings progressed, the Orcas found themselves lagging behind the asking rate with Jayasuriya too, back in the hut. Just when they needed a steady partnership to ease the mounting pressure, they kept losing quick wickets with all the hitters back in the hut without any impact. The inning that once looked in absolute command suddenly lost its momentum in a jiffy in the mid overs and just couldn't recover from the collapse.\n\nDone and dusted! The San Francisco Unicorns seal the deal winning this clash by 23 runs and climbing to the third spot. A job well done by the Men in Orange and Blue. The Seattle Orcas on the other hand will be gutted with the way things panned out for them towards the second half of the chase. The Seattle Orcas kicked off their chase of 166 with a measured approach. Shehan Jayasuriya and Ryan Rickelton got things rolling nicely, forming a steady opening partnership and pouncing on any loose deliveries. Jayasuriya, in particular, was the aggressor in chief as he was timing the ball to perfection, making it look effortless. Even as wickets tumbled at the other end, Jayasuriya stood firm, notching up a solid resilient half-century.\n\nThe Orcas are heading up for their third defeat of the season here and it would be interesting to see how they recover from this in their latter games. However, this game was really under control in the first half with Jayasuriya going hammer and tonks, but they certainly lost the momentum in the next half.\n\nPat Cummins (3-0-30-1) is back into the attack to bowl the last over of his quota. With 33 runs needed off the 11 remaining deliveries, and all the recognised batters into the sheds, the chances of Orcas getting through have zeroed now.\n\nWith Harmeet Singh back in the hut, the tensions further deepen and things have gotten precarious for the Orcas now. They still need 38 off the last 18 remaining deliveries. Cameron Gannon is the next batter in at number 8. Haris Rauf (2-0-23-0) is back into the attack.\n\nW\n\nOvers16.6\n\nScore128 - 6\n\nLiam Plunkett to Harmeet Singh, OUT! TAKEN! Matthew Short with an excellent running catch at deep mid-wicket. Short, on middle, Singh pulls it from closer to the body and hence, he fails to generate the requisite power and the distance as gets the timing completely wrong. It carries towards deep mid-wicket where Matthew Short takes a sharp catch running to his left.\n\n4\n\nOvers16.5\n\nScore128 - 5\n\nLiam Plunkett to Harmeet Singh, FOUR! Edgy but they will take it! Short, on off, Singh looks to pull it but gets a top edge as the ball flies over short fine for a boundary.\n\nStrategic Break! This has been a fabulous comeback from the San Francisco Unicorns with the ball. What looked like a lopsided affair at the beginning of the chase, has turned out to be a nail biting one. With all the big hitters back in the hut, Orcas are still in the hunt of 53 off the last 30 remaining deliveries. Every bowler from the Unicorns has struck timely scalps and helped their team sneak back into the contest. Will Corey Anderson and Co manage to squeeze their opposition further, or will Harmeet Singh play a heroic here? Let's find out together. Corey Anderson (2.2-0-13-1) to continue after the break.\n\n1\n\nOvers14.5\n\nScore110 - 5\n\nPat Cummins to Harmeet Singh, On a length and on off, Singh looks to flick it but gets a leading edge as the ball carries and lands safely at mid on. They cross.\n\n4\n\nOvers14.3\n\nScore109 - 5\n\nPat Cummins to Harmeet Singh, FOUR! They need more of these! Touch short and on off, Harmeet Singh looks to pull it but gets a top edge as the ball goes over the keeper's head for a boundary."

It’s their second defeat in the tournament following their 4-run (DLS method) loss against Washington Freedom. Their big guns Kieron Pollard and Tim David are yet to fire in the tournament with only 43 runs combined between them.\n\nThey have a rich pool of talent in their bowling department, featuring the likes of Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ehsan Adil, and Nosthush Kenjige. With one win, two losses, and no result, they reside 4th in the table with 3 points.\n\nThe Australians are shining bright for Washington Freedom in the 2nd edition of the Major League Cricket as the side remains at the pole position in the standings with 7 points. The inclusion of Steven Smith, Travis Head, and Glenn Maxwell has created wonders. All of their 3 wins came via chasing thanks to their depth in the batting. Even their bowling deserves applause with Saurabh Netravalkar taking his game to a different level, picking up 12 wickets the most in the competition.\n\nIn their latest fixture, they easily outclassed Los Angeles Knight Riders by 8 wickets. Saurabh Netravalkar (4), Glenn Maxwell (3), and Lockie Ferguson (2) got the valuable wickets. Travis Head (54) and Steven Smith’s (42*) impressive show with the bat propelled them to victory with 24 balls to spare."

Their bowlers then ran riot, skittling MI New York for just 88 runs, securing a commanding victory by 94 runs. With this win, Washington Freedom became the first team to qualify for the Playoffs of the second season, consolidating their lead at the top of the points table with nine points in five matches.\n\nMI New York had a terrible start to their run chase as Washington Freedom bowlers ran riot. They were 25/5 by the end of the Powerplay. Steven Taylor (0 off 3), Monank Patel (4 off 6), Dewald Brevis (2 off 5), Shayan Jahangir (3 off 9) and Nicholas Pooran (4 off 6) had lost their wickets cheaply by the sixth over. Skipper Kieron Pollard (4 off 9) and Rashid Khan (7 off 6) followed them back to the pavilion as by the ninth over MI New York had scored 56/7.\n\nRomario Shepherd and Trent Boult displayed some resilience, as they added 33 runs off 16 balls. Shepherd, the last hope for New York, was dismissed in the 11th over after scoring 25 off 14 balls. Maxwell then wrapped things up for Washington, taking two wickets in the 14th over. He removed Boult (16 off 13) on the first ball and Ehsan Adil (0 off 2) on the third to bowl out MI New York to just 88.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, the Washington team had a decent start, thanks to their openers, Steve Smith and Travis Head. However, Smith couldn't capitalize as he was dismissed by Rashid Khan in the fifth over, scoring 8 off 10. Head then took charge and built a solid partnership with Andries Gous. Their timely boundaries and steady play helped Washington cross the 100-run mark in the 11th over.\n\nHowever, Head's blistering knock of 54 off 33 balls, featuring nine fours and two sixes, came to an end in the next over when he was caught by Rashid Khan at long-on off Romario Shepherd. Glen Maxwell soon followed Head back to the pavilion, despite being given a lifeline in the 15th over when Taylor dropped him at mid-off. Rashid Khan eventually dismissed Maxwell in the 16th over, with him managing to score 15 off 14 balls. After 16 overs, Washington stood at 133/3, with Andries Gous still in the middle.\n\nWashington finished their innings strongly, as they scored 49 runs in the last four overs, thanks to the free-flowing strokes of Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra. Gous reached his half-century in the 19th over, while Ravindra smashed two sixes and a four off Boult in the same over, producing as many as 23 runs. Ravindra was dismissed by Kieron Pollard on the third ball of the final over after a quickfire 31 off 14 balls. Gous, who played a vital knock of 59 off 48, was caught on the last ball of the innings, helping Washington post a total of 182/5 in their 20 overs."

Their bowlers then ran riot, skittling MI New York for just 88 runs, securing a commanding victory by 94 runs. With this win, Washington Freedom became the first team to qualify for the Playoffs of the second season, consolidating their lead at the top of the points table with nine points in five matches.\n\nMI New York had a terrible start to their run chase as Washington Freedom bowlers ran riot. They were 25/5 by the end of the Powerplay. Steven Taylor (0 off 3), Monank Patel (4 off 6), Dewald Brevis (2 off 5), Shayan Jahangir (3 off 9) and Nicholas Pooran (4 off 6) had lost their wickets cheaply by the sixth over. Skipper Kieron Pollard (4 off 9) and Rashid Khan (7 off 6) followed them back to the pavilion as by the ninth over MI New York had scored 56/7.\n\nTrending\n\nRomario Shepherd and Trent Boult displayed some resilience, as they added 33 runs off 16 balls. Shepherd, the last hope for New York, was dismissed in the 11th over after scoring 25 off 14 balls. Maxwell then wrapped things up for Washington, taking two wickets in the 14th over. He removed Boult (16 off 13) on the first ball and Ehsan Adil (0 off 2) on the third to bowl out MI New York to just 88.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, the Washington team had a decent start, thanks to their openers, Steve Smith and Travis Head. However, Smith couldn't capitalize as he was dismissed by Rashid Khan in the fifth over, scoring 8 off 10. Head then took charge and built a solid partnership with Andries Gous. Their timely boundaries and steady play helped Washington cross the 100-run mark in the 11th over.\n\nHowever, Head's blistering knock of 54 off 33 balls, featuring nine fours and two sixes, came to an end in the next over when he was caught by Rashid Khan at long-on off Romario Shepherd. Glen Maxwell soon followed Head back to the pavilion, despite being given a lifeline in the 15th over when Taylor dropped him at mid-off. Rashid Khan eventually dismissed Maxwell in the 16th over, with him managing to score 15 off 14 balls. After 16 overs, Washington stood at 133/3, with Andries Gous still in the middle.\n\nWashington finished their innings strongly, as they scored 49 runs in the last four overs, thanks to the free-flowing strokes of Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra. Gous reached his half-century in the 19th over, while Ravindra smashed two sixes and a four off Boult in the same over, producing as many as 23 runs.\n\nHowever, Head's blistering knock of 54 off 33 balls, featuring nine fours and two sixes, came to an end in the next over when he was caught by Rashid Khan at long-on off Romario Shepherd.

However, Rashid's timely strike brought a sigh of relief to the MI camp as he castled Maxwell.\n\nFrom over the wicket, Rashid bowled a well-disguised googly, which Maxwell failed to read. The batter had already made his mind to play an aggressive reverse sweep shot.\n\nHowever, as he couldn't read the variation, the Aussie batter was early onto his shot, with the ball sneaking past his bat to disturb the furniture.\n\nDespite losing Maxwell at the stroke of death overs, Washington Freedom powered themselves to 182/5 in 20 overs, thanks to Rachin Ravindra's hitting masterclass."

Teams have generally struggled to rack up high scores here. Early in the game, there might be some swing and seam movement to exploit. A score around 160 is considered par on this track, with captains likely opting to chase upon winning the toss.\n\nSEA vs LAKR: Probable Playing XIs\n\nSeattle Orcas: Ryan Rickelton, Shehan Jayasuriya, Quinton de Kock (wk), Heinrich Klaasen (c), Aaraon Jones, Imad Wasim, Hammad Azam, Harmeet Singh, Nandre Burger, Cameron Gannon, Zaman Khan\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Jason Roy, Sunil Narine (c), Unmukt Chand (wk), Saif Badar, Nitish Kumar, David Miller, Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan\n\nSEA vs LAKR: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nSEA vs LAKR: Winner Prediction\n\nConsidering the overall team composition and current form, Los Angeles Knight Riders are the favourites to win this clash."

Skipper Steve Smith departed after scoring just 8 runs. No. 3 Andries Gous and opener Travis Head stitched together a crucial partnership of 73 runs, laying the foundation for a big total.\n\nGous, known for his aggressive strokeplay, smashed 59 runs off just 48 balls, peppering the Grand Prairie night with 4 sixes and 3 fours. Head, the ever-reliable left-hander, played a composed innings, scoring 54 runs off 33 balls, including 9 fours and two sixes.\n\nThe middle order continued the momentum. Glenn Maxwell, though dismissed cheaply for 15, provided a quickfire cameo with a towering six.

Both openers, Steven Taylor and Shayan Jahangir, fell cheaply, leaving the middle order with a mountain to climb. None of the remaining batters could manage to build a significant partnership, succumbing to the pressure applied by the Freedom bowlers.\n\nJasdeep Singh was the wrecker-in-chief for Washington, picking up 3 crucial wickets for just 14 runs in his 3 overs. The right-arm medium pacer displayed exceptional control and swing, exposing the vulnerabilities in the New York batting line-up. Lockie Ferguson and Marco Jansen provided excellent support, claiming 2 wickets apiece. The Washington bowling attack, with a mix of pace and spin, never allowed the New York batters to settle, restricting them to a paltry 88 runs in just 13.3 overs.\n\nAlso WATCH: Imad Wasim’s stunning one-handed catch dismisses Mukhtar Ahmed during SEO vs WAF in MLC 2024\n\nDominant Washington Freedom qualifies for the playoffs\n\nThis emphatic victory consolidates Freedom’s position at the top of the MLC 2024 points table.

The Orcas fell short by 23 runs against the San Francisco Unicorns, while the Knight Riders suffered an eight-wicket drubbing at the hands of the Washington Freedom.\n\nTNPL 2024 Broadcast Information:\n\nIndia: Sony Sports Ten 1 SD & HD (12:30 AM IST)\n\nLive Streaming: Jio Cinema (India)\n\nGlobal: Willow by Cricbuzz (USA), YES Network (Canada), Prime Video (Australia & New Zealand), Cricbuzz (Middle East & North Africa), A Sports (Pakistan), ESPN (Sub-Saharan Africa), TNT Sports (UK & Ireland)\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders boast a lineup brimming with experience and talent. Jason Roy, the explosive opener, combined with the wily spin of skipper Sunil Narine, the all-round brilliance of Andre Russell, and the finishing power of David Miller, make the Knight Riders a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas, however, won’t go down without a fight. Their batting will heavily rely on the consistent Quinton de Kock and the leadership of captain Heinrich Klaasen. All eyes will also be on Imad Wasim’s spin wizardry to restrict the Knight Riders’ batting."

That win remains their sole triumph in the tournament, having suffered defeats in their other three matches.

The Orcas will be desperate to recapture the magic of their earlier victory and use this match as a springboard to climb out of last place.\n\nOn the other hand, Los Angeles Knight Riders find themselves in a somewhat better position, currently occupying the fourth spot in the standings with 3 points. However, they too have had their share of struggles and will be keen to solidify their position in the top half of the table.

He bowled a total of 14 dot balls and conceded just one boundary in his entire spell to restrict the opposition to a modest score.\n\nThe ever-consistent Netravalkar came to the fore again with a game-changing spell of 4/35 against LAKR. He was also the stand-out bowler in our opening game against MI NY this season with a spell of 3/24 in four overs.\n\nTravis Head scored his first half-century in MLC in our last game with an entertaining 32-ball 54.

        "date": "Tue Jul 16 12:26:42 2024",
        "body": "In the United States, there have always been four primary sports that ruled over all others — football, baseball (obviously), basketball, and hockey. That said, another new competition is just beginning to flex its muscles and gain respect from fans across the country — Major League Cricket (MLC). MLC T20 cricket league launched in 2022 to bring Cricket on similar lines to major sports leagues in the USA.\n\nMeaning of MLC for Cricket in the United States\n\nCricket is no new entrant to the U.S. sporting landscape; it is undoubtedly a niche sport upheld as an elitist and unattainable spectator sport compared to the other major leagues. However, the rise of MLC may well see that story shift. The league has started to promote Cricket at a scientific level, hack new audiences, and enrich the local role of American Cricket on the professional stage.\n\nMLC plans to tap into a broad audience and introduce Cricket in a traditional form by setting up franchise-based teams across important metropolitan centers. The league’s efforts to groom home-grown talent and the arrival of some international stars are likely to help increase young American cricketers decide they want to be part of their nation side, creating new fanbases for the sport around America.\n\nPartnership with Global Environment: Major League Cricket\n\nBeyond the U.S., MLC has more significant ideas. The General Manager of the league has already announced strategic partnerships with established cricket boards and leagues around the globe, including Cricket West Indies, Cricket Australia, and Emirates Cricket Board. These international connections have allowed MLC to bring on the best global players and coaches, as well as technical expertise in new Netball tactics, raising the standard of play.\n\nDepending on how successful MLC is, the impact on the wider game could be huge for Cricket worldwide. While the league has long been a hit in South Africa, its growing appeal stateside could make it a blueprint for Cricket to establish itself in other non-traditional markets and broaden its global reach.\n\nAlso Read: Major League Cricket (MLC): Showcasing the Rise of Cricketing Titans with Grandest Stage\n\nChallenges and Opportunities of MLC\n\nWhile MLC enters with some encouraging noise, several headwinds ensure the league has its work cut out for it in trying to stay stateside long-term. This will involve massive infrastructure spending, from building world-class cricket stadiums to practice facilities and creating audiences around the game.\n\nThe league also has to lure in American sports fans who are used to a quicker pace and higher scores than the kind dished out by so much soccer. The content and depth of the story created by this will ultimately determine MLC’s success, in conjunction with good marketing efforts to commercialize it.\n\nImpact on the USA Economy of Major League Cricket\n\nThe birth of Major League Cricket represents a historic moment for the game of cricket in America and can have an enormous economic impact!!! The league is expected to have a significant economic impact on America as it continues to grow and makes its mark in North America.\n\nThe future operation of these facilities is expected to provide an economic boost in the long run, while their construction will create work in the short term. Furthermore, better availability of quality cricket infrastructure can aid the genesis and flourishing of the sport at grassroots levels by enhancing financial paybacks.\n\nMajor League Cricket has the capacity to transfer this wealth into the American economy by leveraging professional cricket and may transform itself into a national economic powerhouse, creating jobs, revenue generation, and ancillary industry development. As the league develops further and more rapidly, its economic influence is expected to be a key determinant of both sustainability in the long run and success everywhere else.\n\nConclusion\n\nMajor League Cricket will become a turning point in the global proliferation of Cricket; wait. By launching a new professional league here, MLC seeks to change the dynamic of how Cricket is played in this country and lead American cricketers by example while capturing the attention and imagination — and wallets — of sports fans throughout the USA. As the league keeps evolving and expanding, its contribution to future Cricket will be watched by everyone in their homes worldwide."

Marco Jansen also ended with impressive figures of 2/18 off four overs whereas Lockie Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell got two wickets each.\n\nTravis Head got to his second consecutive half-century to power us to 182/5 in 20 overs. The southpaw hit nine fours and two sixes in his 33-ball 54. Andries Gous top-scored in the contest with 59 off 48 balls, his knock laden with four sixes and three fours.\n\nBatting first, Head got us going with a four and six off Trent Boult in the fourth over as we reached 45/1 at the end of the powerplay. The Aussie continued his aggressive ways hitting three boundaries against spinner Nosthush Kenjige in the ninth over.\n\nHead smashed a six and two fours in the next over to get to his fifty in just 28 balls. Gous also showcased his big-hitting ability with two sixes off Rashid Khan as we got to the 100-run mark after 11 overs. The pair added 73 runs for the second wicket in just 45 balls before Head was caught in the deep for 54.\n\nGous got to his fifty in the penultimate over before Rachin Ravindra injected the much-needed impetus pummeling 20 runs, including two sixes and a four. Ravindra hit 31 off only 14 balls as we went past the 180-run mark.\n\nFor MI NY both Rashid Khan and skipper Kieron Pollard picked up two wickets apiece.\n\nWe got to a great start with the ball as Marco Jansen sent back Steven Taylor off the third ball of the innings. Jasdeep Singh got two wickets in his first two overs, in identical fashion, as the MI NY batters perished to mistimed shots.\n\nJansen got another and soon Nicholas Pooran also holed out in the deep as MI NY collapsed to 25/5 at the end of the powerplay. Jasdeep picked up his third wicket of the night to dismiss Pollard to make things worse for the batting side.\n\nThough Romario Shepherd and Boult showed some resistance, it only delayed the inevitable as we bundled MI NY for just 88 runs and continued our unbeaten run in the MLC 2024 season. Ferguson and Maxwell ended with 2/16 and 2/20, respectively.\n\nWe are currently on top of the MLC 2024 points table with nine points from five matches.\n\nNext up, we will meet the Texas Super Kings in our next match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Friday.\n\nWashington Freedom vs MI New York MLC 2024 brief scores: WF 182/5 in 20 overs (Andries Gous 59, Travis Head 54, Kieron Pollard 2/14, Rashid Khan 2/39) vs MI NY 88/10 in 13.3 overs (Romario Shepherd 25, Trent Boult 16, Jasdeep Singh 3/14, Marco Jansen 2/18).\n\nWashington Freedom won by 94 runs."
