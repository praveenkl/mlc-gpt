        "date": "Mon Jul 15 15:01:20 2024",
        "body": "Dallas-Fort Worth continues to expand its sports landscape and the state of Texas took a front row seat with the launch of Cognizant Major League Cricket in the United States in 2023.\n\nTexas Super Kings, the Major League Cricket franchise based in Texas, is headlined by veteran South African and Top Order Batter Faf du Plessis, who returns for his second season. He will be joined by wicket-keeper Devon Conway, Australian power-hitter Marcus Stoinis, fast-bowler Naveen Ul Haq, and Team USA’s Milind Kumar.\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) is the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States, which began in 2023. Exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, MLC showcases superstar players from around the globe, bringing world-class T20 cricket to America.\n\nAs the 2024 season is underway, here’s some quick facts on MLC and what you can expect from T20 Cricket:\n\nWhere are the matches played?\n\nMatches will take place at Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina. The full schedule and available tickets can be viewed here.\n\nWho are the teams?\n\nThere’s six teams currently in the MLC, representing different cities and regions within the United States - The Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom.\n\nWho won last year?\n\nMI New York claimed victory in the inaugural 2023 MLC season, defeating the Seattle Orcas.\n\nWhat is T20 Cricket?\n\nT20, or Twenty20 is one format of cricket.\n\nIt is a shortened format (around 3 hours) where each team has 20 overs (this includes 120 balls) to score the most runs.\n\nIt’s known for its explosive batting as the time constraints means more incentive to hit big “sixes” and take risks. (Sixes are similar to homeruns for all the baseball fans out there).\n\nAn 'over' is the name given to six consecutive balls bowled by one ‘bowler’. There are 20 of these overs in an ‘inning’.There are two innings in a game.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nEach team has 11 batsmen that will attempt to score more runs (points) than their opponent.\n\nThe fielding side will be trying to get all the batsmen out as soon as possible to keep the runs total low.\n\nA team earns one run when a batsman hits the ball and runs from one set of stumps to the other.\n\nTeams earn four runs for hitting the ball out of bounds and six runs for hitting the ball out of bounds without it hitting the ground.\n\nThe bowler is the player who throws the ball at the stumps to try to knock the ‘bails’ off. (The bowlers are the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball).\n\nWickets/stumps are the three vertical sticks with two smaller ones called bails laid horizontally on top. The goal is to knock the bails off.\n\nA player on the fielding team stands behind the stumps to catch the ball.\n\nThe white lines on the ground is the crease, this is where the wickets and batsman should be.\n\nWhat has MLC done for Cricket in the USA?\n\nMLC has revolutionized the cricket landscape in the USA. Cognizant Major League Cricket was recently awarded List-A status, recognized by the ICC as an official T20 league, making it America’s first world-class domestic tournament. The inaugural 2023 season was a huge success, with sold-out matches garnering millions of viewers worldwide. The recent T20 World Cup was played across the USA and West Indies and saw team USA both co-host and participate in the tournament for the first time. Forty-seven of the players who took part in the World Cup will remain in the USA for MLC.\n\nMLC FAMILY DAYS - SUNDAY SPECIAL\n\nMake your next family outing one to remember.

Russell’s ball hit Head’s bat hard leading to its handle getting disintegrated from the rest of the body.\n\nThe incident happened in the second over of Washington Freedom’s run-chase against the LA Knight Riders at Church Street Park in Morrisville. Head tried to pull a shortish delivery from Russell but ended up losing control as his bat was broken into two pieces. The video of the incident caught the attention of fans on social media.\n\nWatch Andre Rusell breaks Travis Head’s bat into two pieces:\n\nA number of big names are currently in action for their respective teams in the ongoing Major League Cricket.

Despite his bat getting broken into two, the incident didn’t affect Head’s rhythm as he finished as the top run-getter for his side with his 52-run knock.\n\nEarlier, LA Knight Riders were skittled out for 129 runs in just 18.4 overs after brilliant spells from Saurabh Netravalkar and Glenn Maxwell.

        "date": "Mon Jul 15 04:50:57 2024",
        "body": "During the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) clash between the Los Angeles Travis HeadKnight Riders (LAKR) and Washington Freedom (WSF) at Morrisville on Sunday, July 14, a humorous incident unfolded with Travis Head.\n\nThe left-hander was taken aback when his bat broke and unexpectedly flew out of his grip while attempting a pull shot against a brisk short-of-length delivery from West Indian all-rounder Andre Russell. As the ball headed towards mid-on, Head’s bat veered towards the square leg umpire, leaving the Aussie opener visibly astonished.\n\nAfter that incident, Head quickly found his form, smashing a superb 54 off just 32 balls, including two fours and six sixes. In pursuit of a modest 130 for victory, the 30-year-old ensured WSF encountered no difficulties, wrapping up the chase in just 16 overs with eight wickets in hand. Head received strong support from captain Steve Smith, who remained unbeaten on 42 off 36 balls.\n\nThis marked Head’s maiden half-century in the tournament, bringing his total runs to 87 in four matches at an average of 29 and a striking rate exceeding 164.\n\nThe victory ensured WSF’s undefeated streak continued, securing their third win in three completed matches, alongside one No Result. Leading comfortably with 7 points from 4 matches and three games remaining, WSF are well positioned for a top-four finish and advancement to the playoffs.\n\nWSF’s stellar bowling preceded Travis Head’s exploits\n\nTravis Head’s half-century stood out in WSF’s chase, following a dominant bowling performance in the first innings. Opting to field after winning the toss, WSF restricted LAKR to just 129 runs in 18.4 overs.\n\nUSA’s Saurabh Netravalkar, continuing his impressive form from the 2024 T20 World Cup, recorded exceptional figures of 4/35 in 3.4 overs. He was well-supported by Glenn Maxwell (3/15) and Lockie Ferguson (2/31), keeping LAKR’s batsmen under constant pressure.\n\nThis defeat marked LAKR’s third loss in four completed matches, placing them second from the bottom with three points from five games. They face a crucial match against the Seattle Orcas on Wednesday, July 17.\n\nMeanwhile, WSF will aim to maintain their unbeaten streak when they meet MI New York (MINY) on Tuesday, July 16."

        "body": "Saurabh Netravalkar and Glenn Maxwell headlined an incisive bowling attack as Washington Freedom beat Los Angeles Knight Riders by eight wickets in their fourth Major League Cricket 2024 match at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina on Sunday.\n\nNetravalkar picked up 4/35 while Player of the Match Maxwell bowled a miserly spell of 3/15 in four overs as we dismissed LAKR for 129 in 18.4 overs. Saif Badar scored 35 off 28 balls for the Knight Riders.\n\nIn response, we reached 130/2 in 16 overs with Travis Head top-scoring in the contest with 54 off just 32 balls. The southpaw’s first fifty in MLC was laden with six sixes and two fours. Our skipper Steve Smith hit two sixes and two fours to remain unbeaten on 42 off 36 balls.\n\nOpting to bowl first, Netravalkar struck with his first ball of the day to beat LAKR Skipper Sunil Narine for a duck. The left-arm pacer made his first over even more memorable with the wicket of Unmukt Chand off the last ball.\n\nSmith introduced spinner Maxwell in the third over. The off-spinner reaped immediate reward going through the gate of Shakib Al Hasan as LAKR were three down with the score reading just 13. Soon it became 18/4 with Lockie Ferguson also getting into the act to clean up Jason Roy.\n\nMaxwell returned to pick up two more wickets including the big-hitting Andre Russell, who was dismissed for 20. Netravalkar polished off the tail to end with four wickets as the LAKR innings folded up for 129. Meanwhile, Ferguson also chipped in with 2/31 in four overs.\n\nChasing a modest target, Smith and Head gave us a flying start racing to 61 at the end of the powerplay. Head was particularly severe smashing sixes off all four bowlers introduced in the first six overs as 44 runs came from boundaries during the period.\n\nHead brought up his fifty, off just 27 balls, in style with a huge six down the ground as the Australian duo added 79 for the opening wicket, the highest partnership for us, for any wicket in the history of MLC.\n\nSmith took charge once Head departed and remained unbeaten to see us through with four overs to spare. Smith jumped to second in the overall batting charts of MLC 2024 with 126 runs at an unbelievable average of 126.00 and a strike rate of 140.00.\n\nAfter yet another victory, we continue on top of the MLC 2024 points table with seven points from four matches.\n\nWe are up against MI New York in our next match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Tuesday.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders vs Washington Freedom MLC 2024 brief scores: LAKR 129/10 in 18.4 overs (Saif Badar 35, Andre Russell 20, Saurabh Netravalkar 4/35, Glenn Maxwell 3/15) vs WF 130/2 in 16 overs (Travis Head 54, Steve Smith 42, Shadley van Schalkwyk 1/17, Spencer Johnson 1/33).\n\nWashington Freedom won by eight wickets."
