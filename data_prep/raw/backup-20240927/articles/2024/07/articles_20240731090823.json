        "body": "Saurabh Netravalkar, a fast bowler from the USA, has been making waves in international cricket. Born in India, he represented the country in the Under-19 World Cup and shared the field with players like Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh.\n\nAfter moving to the USA for his studies, Netravalkar balanced his career as a software developer and a cricketer. His recent performances in the T20 World Cup 2024 and Major League Cricket 2024 have been remarkable that has earned him widespread praise.\n\nBET NOW: Exclusive sign-up offers and bonuses when you bet on sporting action\n\nIn a recent interview, Saurabh Netravalkar expressed his desire to play in the IPL 2025.\n\nWhat did Saurabh Netravalkar say on playing IPL 2025?\n\nBefore the T20 World Cup 2024, Netravalkar had said that USA is his karmabhumi (land of work), while India is his janmabhumi (motherland). He has done quite a lot for his land of work, so when asked about his interest in playing for his motherland, India, in the prestigious league, Netravalkar replied:\n\n\"I mean, that is not in my hands. If the selection happens, it happens. I will try and let's see.\"\n\nHow did Netravalkar perform in T20 World Cup 2024?\n\nNetravalkar has been instrumental in the USA's surprising run in the T20 World Cup. The USA defeated Canada and Pakistan in the group stages. He contributed in restricting Pakistan to 159/7 by taking 2 wickets for just 18 runs in 4 overs and bowled a match-winning super over.\n\nMore: Did Rohit Sharma photoshop training picture to show a fitter body? Fans go crazy over Sri Lanka training image\n\nHow did Netravalkar perform in Major League Cricket 2024?\n\nIn addition to his World Cup heroics, Netravalkar shined in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. He was the top wicket-taker with 15 wickets in 7 games. His team, Washington Freedom, won the title, which added to his growing reputation.\n\nAndy Flower, former Zimbabwe player and current Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) head coach, who worked with Netravalkar in the ILT20 league, praised his skills and professionalism. He sees Netravalkar as a left-arm swing bowler who excels in death overs.\n\n\"His stocks have flown off the roof. Very skillful and a great man around the team. People will be looking and thinking, that's a left-arm swing bowler who can also bowl for us at the death,\" Flower told ESPN Cricinfo.\n\nWhen is the IPL Mega Auction?\n\nThe dates for IPL 2025 mega auction haven’t been made official yet but like the previous auctions, it's highly likely that the mega auction will be conducted in December 2024 or February 2025.\n\nWhen does IPL 2025 start?\n\nIPL 2025 is likely to start from March 23, 2025 up until May 29, 2025. The dates haven't been made official by the BCCI yet and might change in due course of time.\n\nWith his impressive record, Netravalkar could be a sought-after player in the auction. As he sets his sights on the IPL 2025, fans and cricket experts alike will be watching closely to see if he can make a mark in one of the world's most prestigious cricket leagues."

        "body": "Nicholas Pooran and Kieron Pollard both failed to perform as MI New York’s miserable defense of their Major League Cricket title ended with a seven-wicket defeat to Texas Super Kings in the eliminator match at Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nSent in to bat, MI New York managed to rally a competitive 163 for eight from their allocated 20 overs after finding themselves struggling on 18 for two in the fourth over.\n\nRashid Khan was the top scorer with 55 from 30 balls. Both Pooran and Pollard, on 8 and 6 respectively failed to make an impression.\n\nIn reply, South African Faf du Plessis belted 72 off 47 balls to lead the run chase, with fellow opener Devon Conway of New Zealand supporting with 51 off 43 balls and Australia Aaron Hardie finishing with an unbeaten 40 off 22 deliveries.\n\nMI New York endured a poor start when they lost Dewald Brevis to the fourth ball of the game without a run on the board and then lost superstar Pooran, holing out to mid-on in the fourth over from medium pacer Marcus Stoinis (2-18).\n\nMonank Patel, who struck 48 from 41 balls, had two key partnerships posting 49 for the third with opener Shayan Jahangir on 25 and a further 35 for the fourth wicket with Rashid Khan.\n\nAfter Monank departed, Rashid Khan took control and posted a 53-run, fifth-wicket partnership with West Indies all-rounder Romario Shepherd who was on seven not out, to inspire momentum coming in at the end of the innings.\n\nSuper Kings never faltered in their response. Captain du Plessis stroked six fours and three sixes in a 101-run first-wicket partnership with Conway who blasted three fours and a six.\n\nHardie then entered and smacked three fours and two sixes in a 66-run, unbroken second-wicket partnership with Conway, as Super Kings reached their target with nine balls to spare."

        "date": "Sun Jul 28 07:15:29 2024",
        "body": "Emerging Cricket takes a look at the domestic contributors for MLC finalists San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom ahead of Sunday’s MLC Final. The Bart King award will likely come down to SF’s Hassan Khan and Washington’s Saurabh Netravalkar. It’s all up for grabs on Sunday in Grand Prairie.\n\nWashington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns made waves in the lead up to the 2024 Major League Cricket season with big name overseas signings. For the Freedom, it was the addition of Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head. For the Unicorns, it was Pat Cummins and young phenom Jake Fraser-McGurk. But an injection of Australian cricket royalty isn’t enough on its own to carry a team to the league final, no matter how potent the dose.\n\nWith the requirement of five domestics in every playing eleven, teams need to find the right mix to supplement their well known international stars to go deep in a longer tournament than the inaugural edition. And to those who follow American domestic cricket closely, it should come as no surprise that San Francisco and Washington are meeting in the final.\n\nSunday’s final might also determine more than just the 2024 MLC Champions. The favorites for the Bart King Domestic Player of the Tournament Award are Washington’s Saurabh Netravalkar and San Francisco’s Hassan Khan. In 2023, the award went to Seattle Orcas bowler Cameron Gannon, a consolation prize for falling to MI New York in the championship game. This year the prize will likely go to whomever makes a bigger mark in Sunday’s final.\n\nDomestic Bowlers set the table for Washington’s overseas batting power\n\nWashington’s Saurabh Netravalkar, the left handed Oracle developer who stole hearts and inspired memes during the T20 World Cup, is the current league leader in wickets with 14. This in spite of missing two games to attend the birth of his first child. Tack that on to his ten wickets from six games in 2023, including the tournament’s best ever figures of six wickets for nine runs, and Washington have perhaps the most valuable domestic player across the league’s first two seasons.\n\nAlong with Netravalkar, Washington returned three other regular domestic starters from 2023 in Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed and Andries Gous, fresh from impressing at the World Cup with Saurabh.\n\nWith the bat, the Freedom have benefited heavily from the good form of their overseas stars. Travis Head currently sits at second in the league with 327 runs for the season, at an average of 54.50 and strike rate of 173.93 and five half centuries in only eight games. Head also tops the leaderboards for both fours (43) and sixes (23). Captain Steve Smith sits only two places behind Head in the league run rankings with 248 at an average of 49.60 and a strike rate of 142.52 and two fifties.\n\nWashington’s batting has been so reliable, in fact, that they’ve only had eight different batters take strike this season, and only four with more than four innings. Eight half centuries from overseas batters have surely limited chances for middle order domestic batters like Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed and Lahiru Milantha.\n\nFrom the domestic batters, Andries Gous has enjoyed consistent chances in the top order, batting six times out of seven games played, also missing a game for the birth of a child. While Gous displayed the ability to change gears in the World Cup, he’s played more of a supporting role with the Freedom this season, often conceding strike to a hot partner while staying alive in the middle for an average of 44 and strike rate of 115.78, not out three times.\n\nWashington domestic batters do what’s needed\n\nIn all, Washington domestics faced 211 balls (29.84% of the team’s total) and scored 253 of the team’s 1029 batted runs (24.59%). The low strike rate can be attributed to the support role of Gous at the top, and to a match saving 63 run partnership between Pienaar and Milantha against Seattle that began after the first ball of the tenth over with Washington at 64 runs for five wickets chasing 124, ending triumphantly after the second ball of the 19th over. In short, Washington domestic batters have gotten the job done when needed, reflected in their collective batting average of 63.25.\n\nThose sizing up the Freedom roster could see that the team would lean heavily on domestic bowling. Netravalkar, Justin Dill and Akhilesh Bodugum were retained, while Ian Holland, Amilla Aponso and U23 Yasir Mohammad were acquired in the 2024 domestic draft. The variety and depth was obvious and high volume was a certainty, but the question would be what combination of fast and spin bowling would Washington utilize?\n\nFive different domestics have bowled for Washington, accounting for 47.5% of the team’s volume, led by Netravalkar’s 22.2 overs. As a team, Washington’s bowling economy is a glorious 7.746, and they take a wicket every 19.26 runs. Domestics have taken 35 out of the team’s 58 wickets (60.34%) at an average of only 15.37, while going only slightly more expensive (7.864 economy) than their overseas teammates (7.649 economy).\n\nNext man up: Depth matters\n\nJessy Singh, released by New York following a 2023 season in which he bowled in just one game, found himself without a team after March’s 2024 MLC domestic draft. Just a few months later, Jessy appeared in five games for USA in the T20 World Cup. Though he claimed the wicket of Babar Azam in USA’s famous upset victory over Pakistan, the remainder of the tournament came with mixed performances. The supplemental draft came and went with Jessy again unselected.\n\nJessy kept in game condition by bowling in the nets for MI New York until Washington added him to the roster in Netravalkar’s absence. He was put straight into the eleven and rewarded the Freedom with two MVP efforts in two games, giving the team three such performances from domestics this season.\n\n“None of these guys have seen me in person, it speaks highly about them. They backed me to be in the eleven today, which I wasn’t expecting,” Jessy said in a Washington Freedom social media video following his Freedom debut. “It never felt like it’s my first game with the franchise, just coming in.”\n\nBalance is key for San Francisco\n\nFor San Francisco, domestic balance has been found throughout both the batting order and bowling attack. Quite literally.\n\nHassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam PLunkett, Carmi Le Roux, Juanoy Drysdale, Tajinder Singh and captain Corey Anderson have combined for 72 of the Unicorns 143.5 overs this season. Their domestic corps has taken 28 of 38 wickets and outperforms overseas bowlers in economy, 8.319 to 8.812, averaging only 21.39 runs per wicket compared to a whopping 63.30 from overseas bowlers.\n\nWhile Hassan Khan has been the clear star, taking 9 wickets at an economy of 6.33 in 18 overs and scoring 191 runs at a strike rate of 140.44 and average of 47.75, Corey Anderson has provided the Unicorns with yet another domestic all round performer. While he’s done a bit less with the bat than you’d expect (111 runs at 127.58 SR and 27.75 average), Corey has utilized his left arm to fill gaps in the overs to the tune of 8.1 overs at 8.69 with four wickets. Corey also took one of the best catches you’ll ever see against TSK on Friday night.\n\nBut it’s Corey’s captaincy and familiarity with the domestic players that really makes him stand out. Juanoy Drysdale attributed his early comfort coming into the team in part to Corey’s “calm, cool and collected personality.”\n\nDepth matters, part two\n\nIn just three games, Drysdale has given San Francisco their very own Jessy Singh.\n\nWhen Liam Plunkett was ruled out with an injury after playing in four games, the Unicorns had a roster spot to fill. Drysdale had been named as a reserve for USA Cricket during the World Cup, but never got called up to appear in a game. Like Jessy, Juanoy was passed up in the MLC domestic draft and again in the supplemental draft.\n\nHoning his craft with The Philadelphians of Minor League Cricket, Drysdale had another familiar face to ease him into the squad. “Playing with Liam Plunkett as a coach and mentor in the minor league has been incredibly beneficial,” Drysdale told Emerging Cricket. “I’ve learned a lot from him, especially about being a Pro Athlete. His guidance has played a crucial role in preparing me for the MLC. Happy to be here!”\n\nAnd after Friday’s win to advance to the MLC Final, the Unicorns must be happy to have him. With San Francisco defending 200 runs against the potent Texas Super Kings in front of a big Super Kings home crowd, Juanoy struck in the 8th over to get Aaron Hardle while the home team was cruising at 84 for the loss of just one. In his very next over, the tenth of the Super Kings innings, Juanoy struck again, claiming Marcus Stoinis for just one run.\n\nBrody Couch and Carmi le Roux have also expressed great talent, combining for eight wickets in eight innings between them, while Plunkett took five wickets before bowing out of the tournament. These performances from domestic fast bowlers were crucial considering the underwhelming output from Pat Cummings so far, who has struck only twice in 19 overs.\n\nDomestic batting: MLC’s true unicorn\n\nBut unlike the Freedom, the Unicorns have had to rely regularly on their domestic batters to get to this point. Particularly in the middle order. Facing 358 (42.27%) of 847 deliveries this season, and striking at 129.60, San Francisco’s domestic batters have pulled their weight.\n\nAlong with Khan and Anderson, 21 year old Bay Area resident Sanjay Krishnamurthi has been a major bright spot for the team. After appearing in zero games in 2023, the Unicorns retained Sanjay as their U23 and spoke highly of his talent and potential. Unicorns leadership have put their money where their mouth is in 2024, playing Sanjay in all eight games. The young gun’s performance on Monday Night against this Freedom squad was the best from a domestic batter this season.\n\nWith San Francisco chasing 174 in a game shortened to 14 overs by rain, star batter Finn Allen got out on the very first ball. Sanjay and Jake Fraser-McGurk would team up for 45 runs before the young Aussie edged Andrew Tye straight back to Gous in the fifth over. Sanjay tacked on another 77 with Josh Inglis (45 from 17) in a hurry and everything was looking sparkly for the Unicorns until Tye struck again, taking both Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford in the 10th over.\n\nHassan Khan (32 from 11) would help Sanjay take it home with two balls to spare, and the Unicorns would hand the Freedom their first loss of the season. Sanjay’s brave innings, highlighted by a memorable one handed six over third man against Netravalkar, would end with the Unicorns over the line, not out after scoring 79 from 42 with a half dozen sixes.\n\nFriday’s Qualifier was a rematch, and Washington had their revenge, holding San Francisco to just 145 runs and chasing it down with 27 balls in hand. Sunday’s final will be the tiebreaker for the season, and it will likely determine the Bart King award winner.\n\nThese are two teams with so much in common and so much to prove. Two teams not affiliated with IPL franchises. Two teams that bat a domestic at number three. Two teams that have featured domestic fast bowling replacements who have had big moments in big wins. Two teams that have awarded game MVP to domestics three times each. Two teams that have had to build their brand from scratch. Considering the nature of the contests so far between these two teams, we might have MLC’s first truly organic rivalry.\n\nYou’re reading Emerging Cricket — brought to you by a passionate group of volunteers with a vision for cricket to be a truly global sport, and a mission to inspire passion to grow the game.\n\nBe sure to check out our homepage for all the latest news, please subscribe for regular updates, and follow EC on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube."

He took a voluntary break midway through the tournament to get into a better mental space, but failed once again on his return ahead of the play-offs. In the Eliminator, he was dismissed for a first-ball duck as RCB lost to Rajasthan Royals.\n\nGlenn Maxwell was axed from Punjab Kings squads after a similar horror run in IPL 2020. In that season, he scored 108 runs in 13 matches at an average of 15.42 and a strike rate of 101.88.\n\nVirat kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell formed a formidable trio at RCB even though they failed to hand RCB their maiden IPL trophy. But going by the latest developments, it's very likely that Maxwell and du Plessis would be released by the Bengaluru-based franchise.\n\nThe IPL owners meeting with the BCCI will also have discussion over the reintroduction of Right-To-Match option (RTM). The owners are keen on having the option to five to six retentions. If the RTM option is brought back, or an increased number of retentions are allowed, RCB could look to retain Maxwell at a lower price."

        "body": "Former Australian cricket team’s captain Steve Smith recently led his side the Washington Freedom to their maiden Major League Cricket (MLC) title, beating the San Francisco Unicorns in the final match to win the coveted MLC 2024 Trophy. Steve Smith played a key role for his team as a captain and batter.\n\nFind Best Betting Tips and Predictions for India vs Sri Lanka Series Here\n\nAlthough Steve Smith is not very much known for his T20 game, Smith proved everyone wrong in the MLC. There were much confusion among the cricket enthusiasts as to why the Ricky Ponting led side opted to bring Steve Smith into the fold that included players like Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell etc.\n\nBut Steve Smith proved all his doubters wrong. The Washington Freedom finished at the top of the table with 5 wins and 1 loss from their 7 matches. The 35-years-old Steve Smith led side dominated the playoffs, beating the San Francisco Unicorns in the Qualifier and the Final by 7 wickets and 96 runs respectively.\n\nNot only did Steve Smith led his side really well, he contributed significantly with the bat as well. Smith scored 336 runs from 9 innings with a strike rate of 148.67 and average of 56. With this brilliant performance from Smith, he certainly has managed to turn some IPL teams’ attention towards himself, especially some teams who maybe looking for a new captain in the upcoming IPL 2025 Mega Auction later this year. In this article, we take a look at _ teams who maybe to willing to sign Steve Smith as captain for IPL 2025.\n\nPunjab Kings\n\nAn Australian captain and Punjab Kings is a good combination. Punjab Kings (Formerly Kings XI Punjab) reached their last IPL final way back in the year 2014, which unfortunately they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders. They had an Australian George Bailey as their captain. Since then, Glenn Maxwell has been the other Aussie to captain Punjab, but they never reached the previous heights again. The Kings recently had Shikhar Dhawan and Sam Curran as captain in IPL 2024 and it seems they will be looking for a captain in the IPL 2025 Mega Auction. In that case, Steve Smith can be an option Punjab Kings may go after. Smith would easily be able to give them 2 seasons atleast as captain.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have had the privilege of having some really great captains over the years in the IPL, the likes of Virat Kohli and current Faf du Plessis. However, there might be some debate of captaincy options at RCB as their current captain Faf du Plessis is currently 40-years-old. In that case, Steve Smith would be a good short-term captaincy option for them to prepare their next captain as Smith would easily be able to give 2 season.\n\nLucknow Super Giants\n\nSteve Smith already has a relationship with the Super Giants. Steve Smith was with the Rising Pune Supergiant in the IPL in 2016 and 2017, when they joined the league in place of CSK and Rajasthan, where he replaced MS Dhoni as the captain of the team and led his side to the final, which unfortunately they lost against Mumbai Indians by 1 run. Since then, Smith only featured in the 2021 IPL season for Delhi Capitals and never found a place again. Lucknow Super Giants have the same owners as Pune Supergiant and with team’s captain KL Rahul likely to leave, the management might turn to their former leader Steve Smith."

        "body": "Preparations for the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 are in full swing. This time, a mega auction is set to take place, where players will see a significant influx of money. Teams are keeping an eye on players who have recently performed well. Currently, various T20 leagues are ongoing worldwide, with players showcasing their talents. Recently, the Major League Cricket 2024 in the USA concluded, where Washington Freedom emerged as the champions. Three players stood out with their performances this season, demonstrating that they are ready to shine in IPL 2025.\n\nThese players include New Zealand’s Finn Allen, former Australian captain Steve Smith, and USA’s star bowler Saurabh Netravalkar. All three players impressed with their performances in Major League Cricket 2024. If these players enter the IPL mega auction, they could command high bids.\n\nFinn Allen (New Zealand) (IPL 2025)\n\nFinn Allen was the third-highest run-scorer in Major League Cricket 2024. He batted explosively throughout the season, scoring 306 runs in 9 innings at an average of 34 and a strike rate of 187.73. Allen notched up one century and two fifties during the season.\n\nFinn Allen hails from New Zealand and has previously played in the IPL, but he went unsold in the last auction. This time, teams will be eager to acquire him. In the mega auction, he could attract bids worth millions as he fulfills the role of a powerful opener for any team.\n\nSteve Smith (Australia)\n\nSteve Smith was the second top-scorer of the season, delivering remarkable performances. As captain of Washington Freedom, Smith scored 336 runs in 9 matches at an average of 56.00 and a strike rate of 148. He hit three fifties and played as an opening batsman, providing quick starts alongside Travis Head, leading his team to victory.\n\nSteve Smith is known as a player for ODIs and Tests. He went unsold in the IPL 2024 auction and was subsequently left out of Australia’s T20 World Cup 2024 squad. However, following his strong performance in Major League Cricket, Smith is expected to be in high demand in the IPL 2025 mega auction.\n\nAlso read: How Many Retentions will be Allowed in IPL 2025 Auction? Details Revealed\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar (USA)\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar impressed everyone with his bowling in the T20 World Cup 2024. An Indian-origin player who shifted to the USA years ago, Netravalkar has played for India’s U-19 team. In Major League Cricket 2024, he took 15 wickets in 7 matches at an economy rate of 7.67 for the champion team Washington Freedom.\n\nSaurabh is a left-arm fast bowler who excels in bowling during the powerplay and has the skill to maintain accurate line and length in death overs. Scoring against him is not easy for any batter. This is why, when Saurabh enters the IPL 2025 mega auction, franchises are expected to bid heavily to secure his services."

        "body": "Major League Cricket 2024 attracted a lot of viewers this time around. Hence, a few IPL teams would consider this league while planning for their squads next season. Here, we take a look at the list of three top performers in MLC 2024 who might be selected for the IPL 2025 Mega Auctions.\n\n1) Finn Allen\n\nWith a strike rate close to 190, Finn Allen was in brilliant touch in MLC 2024. He also scored a lot of runs and that makes him an exciting option to have in the team.\n\nFinn Allen was in RCB a few years ago but did not get a single game. Considering he is also a reliable wicket-keeper, he could be a must-have for some teams. The Kiwi is still young and would be an investment for the future. Therefore, many franchises could line up for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Steve Smith\n\nSteve Smith is one of the top performers in MLC 2024 who might be selected for the IPL 2025 Mega Auctions. The Australian cricketer was in brilliant form in the tournament. He finished as the second-highest run-getter and also won the tournament as the skipper.\n\nThere would be some teams who would like to have the experience and skills of Steve Smith at the top of the order. If needed, teams like Punjab Kings could also take him as the skipper. Hence, he is on this list.\n\n3) Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nThe USA cricketer had a strong run in the 2024 T20 World Cup. With 15 wickets, he also finished as the highest wicket-taker of MLC 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaurabh is basically excellent with the new ball, especially with his movement and his angle. If not as the lead overseas pacer, as a backup, he would be a solid choice to have in the team. Mumbai Indians usually prefer to have two left-arm seamers in the squad. Therefore, such teams could target the cricketer."

        "body": "The Cognizant Major League Cricket Season 2 final took place in Grand Prairie Texas on Sunday night with the Washington Freedom taking on the San Francisco Unicorns before an energetic sold-out crowd.\n\nFans started pouring into the stadium early, and many stayed well past the closing ceremonies, savoring every last minute of their summer of cricket.\n\nThe drones stole the show\n\nWhile the Cognizant Major League Cricket is packed with many of the world’s top cricketers, several of whom were on the field Sunday, the real star of the event was the drone halftime show.\n\nThe Freedom, who lost the toss, got off to a thundering start putting up a formidable 207 for 5, behind the impressive knocks of Captain Steve Smith (88 off 52 balls including seven 4s and six 6es), Glenn Maxwell (40 off 22 balls) and Andries Gous (21 off 14 balls).\n\nSoon after the Freedom finished their innings, a little past 9PM local time, the stadium lights went off, and fans were treated to a 10 minute display of lights and colors, as an army of drones created picture after cricket-themed picture against a backdrop of music and the pitch black Dallas sky.\n\nAlmost as loud as the hit songs were the roars of the crowd with every scene change.\n\nHere are some of the visual highlights:\n\nGetting their money’s worth\n\nAfter the drone show, the most popular attraction with fans were, interestingly, the sponsor activation booths.\n\nRoyal Foods was giving out cups of rice and opportunities to join a promotion; and Remitly was giving out merchandise. Fans were lining up in droves for both.\n\nSponsors were front and center later in the evening as well. Two sponsor representatives — Todd Myers, COO of Willow TV (which was both a sponsor as well as the official broadcast partner for the US and Canada), and Dominic Rae, Sponsorships Manager for Stake — participated in the post-match awards ceremony.\n\nWillow TV’s Myers presented Saurabh Netravalkar with the tournament’s Leading Wicket Taker award.\n\nStake’s Rae, an Australian resident himself, presented Travis Head with the Player of the Tournament award.\n\nIn addition, USA Cricket’s new CEO, Johnathan Atkeison — in attendance a few days before officially starting on the job — presented the Domestic Player of the Tournament to the Unicorns’ Hassan Khan.\n\nSlight anticlimax\n\nIn contrast to the Freedom, the Unicorns’ innings fell apart pretty quickly, as they lost three early wickets in the power play. With a high target (208) and a high and climbing required run rate, the pressure resulted in a quick succession of dismissals.\n\nIn the end, they were all out for 111 after only 16 innings. The Freedom won the championship handily, by 96 runs.\n\nLet freedom reign\n\nThat anticlimactic end of the match did not take away from the Freedom’s victory and accomplishment — in fact, it enhanced it.\n\nThey dominated the tournament, finishing at the top of the table, and only losing once to the Unicorns, who they then went on to defeat twice.\n\nAfter the match, during and after the awards ceremony, the extended Freedom family celebrated on the pitch. Team owner Sanjay Govil could be seen celebrating with the Freedom’s players and staff.\n\nCEO Dhiraj Malhotra, an IPL and ICC veteran, was walking around greeting the opposition and making sure all players and guests were taken care of, and Head of Marketing Sumeet Rajpal was capturing moments to share on the team’s social channels.\n\nWe’re pinching ourselves\n\nFor American fans of cricket, MLC Season 2 was an absolute delight.\n\nTo have top foreign stars in our midst for a full month, on the heels of the World Cup, was cricket ecstasy: Pat Cummins, Lockie Ferguson, Rachin Ravindra, Haris Rauf, Rashid Khan, Sunil Narine, Marcus Stoinis, Jason Roy, David Miller, Faf du Plessis — and too many others to name. The talent level in the MLC 2 was probably second only to the IPL as far as T20 tournaments go.\n\nTo top it off, many American cricketers shone brightly throughout July: some cricket household names (Netravalkar, Gous, Ali Khan, and Corey Anderson, among others) and some new stars, including the Unicorns’ Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Hassan Khan (the latter being awarded domestic player of the tournament).\n\nThis was something US cricket fans would never have even dared imagined just a few years ago.\n\nMLC Co-Founder Sameer Mehta summed up the sentiment for us well during the post-match celebrations: “look at this — this is all very real.”\n\nThis statement captured the years of vision and effort on the part of Mehta and his co-founder Vijay Srinivasan to make Sunday happen.\n\nIndeed, major kudos to the MLC team that put on this final as well as the whole tournament: Mehta and Srinivasan, Monica Sadhu, Justin Geale, Zubin Surkari, Mervyn Pereira, William Swann, Selby Sturzenegger, David White, and many others — and of course to all the MLC teams and their staffs, and many other outside partners (not least the team from Kojo, spearheaded by Britt Prince).\n\nWe are already getting extremely excited for Season 3."

        "body": "In a spectacular display of power hitting and strategic bowling, Washington Freedom etched their name on the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 trophy with a massive 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in the championship final at Grand Prairie Stadium. Led by a stellar performance from Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell, Freedom set an imposing target of 208, which proved too steep for the Unicorns to chase in the match on Sunday. In need of a strong start, the Unicorns were immediately on the back foot.\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk (3) was dismissed early in the third over, and Marco Jansen (3/28) struck a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen (13), who scored a century in the qualifier. With the score at 30/3, the Unicorns were in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued as Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) fell early, extinguishing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, who was brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, further tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then cleaned out the tail with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the ultimate match of the tournament, the team from Washington lost Head (9) early. Then, Steve Smith (88 in 52 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) took centre stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock.\n\nHe found support in Andries Gous (21 in 14 balls, with three fours and a six), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, finding the boundary with ease.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40 in 22 balls, with a four and four sixes) joined Smith and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as both Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith’s departure, followed shortly by Maxwell’s, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. The Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) beat San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs"

        "body": "In a spectacular display of power hitting and strategic bowling, the Washington Freedom etched their name on the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) trophy with a huge 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in the championship final at Grand Prairie Stadium. Led by a stellar performance from Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell, the Freedom set an imposing target of 208, which proved too high for the Unicorns to chase in Sunday’s match. Needing a strong start, the Unicorns found themselves immediately behind.\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk (3) was dismissed early in the third over and Marco Jansen (3/28) struck a crucial blow to remove Finn Allen (13), who had scored a century in the qualifier. With the score at 30/3, the Unicorns were in deep trouble.\n\nThe collapse of the middle order continued as Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) fell early, dashing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, brought in for the final over, took two crucial wickets, further tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then cleaned up the tail with an impressive spell, finishing with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the final match of the tournament, the Washington team had lost Head (9) early on. Then Steve Smith (88 in 52 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) took centre stage and anchored the innings with a masterful knock.\n\nHe found support in Andries Gous (21 in 14 balls, with three fours and a six), who added a stabilising partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) went down without significant contributions. Undaunted, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, finding the boundary with ease.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40 in 22 balls, with a four and four sixes) joined Smith and the duo took control of the Unicorns' match with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as both Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a huge total.\n\nSmith's departure, followed shortly by Maxwell's, brought in Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who made a quick cameo with a couple of big hits to take the total past 200. The Freedom ended their innings on 208, a record total for a final.\n\nShort scores: Washington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) defeated San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs"
