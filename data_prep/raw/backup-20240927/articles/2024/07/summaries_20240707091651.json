Kieron Pollard, the MI New York captain, is unsure about the track and wants to see how it plays out.\n\n**Teams:**\nThe playing XIs for both teams are:\n\nSeattle Orcas: Quinton de Kock (w), Aaron Jones, Nauman Anwar, Heinrich Klaasen (c), Michael Bracewell, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Wasim, Harmeet Singh, Cameron Gannon, Nandre Burger, and Zaman Khan.\n\nMI New York: Steven Taylor, Monank Patel, Nicholas Pooran (w), Shayan Jahangir, Tim David, Kieron Pollard (c), Rashid Khan, Ruben Clinton, Ehsan Adil, Trent Boult, and Anrich Nortje.\n\n**Pitch Report:**\nAccording to Scott Styris, the pitch is a new one, with square boundaries of 206 ft and 217 ft, and a straight boundary of 240 ft. The ball comes onto the bat well, and there may be some seam movement due to the live, green grass. Overall, it's a very good batting pitch."
