        "body": "Right then, that will be it from us for this contest. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. The action continues at the Major League Cricket, 2024. The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the Washington Freedom in Match 17 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas. That game will be played on July 20th and will start at 6.00 am IST (12.30 am GMT). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nThe skipper of San Francisco Unicorns is also the Player of the Match for his sublime knock. He says that he is pretty happy with the win. Adds that they bat deep and credits Hassan Khan who batted superbly today. Mentions that they need to pick the aggressive options and find the boundary when they can. Shares that he and Hassan Khan spoke well through the middle and got ahead of the game in the latter stages with the bat. Adds that he is happy to perform against the MINY side. Ends by sharing that they were under par with the bat but the guys showed a good fight and it shows the character of the team.\n\nThe losing skipper of MI New York, Kieron Pollard says the middle phase with the ball was the one where the opposition got back in the game but they had it covered for a long while with the bat but they gave it away in the end. Adds that around 120 was what they had in mind after their bowling in the first 10 overs but the opposition batted well and posted above 145 making things difficult for them. Says that one has to congratulate the opposition and not try to take credit away from them as they played better on the day. Says that he hasn't done justice to the side himself with his batting not firing and that has cost the team for the majority of the tournament. Closes by saying that the batting unit has not done well throughout the tournament and overall as a batting unit they have let the fans and franchise down but they still have one game to go and they'll look to play that well.\n\nMatthew Short is up for a chat. He says it's a huge win as MI New York is a quality side and they have some brilliant players of T20 format. Credits Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan for that superb partnership that kept them in the game. Mentions that the top order has done well so far apart from today and the middle order stepped up when the side needed them the most and that's a good sign for any side.\n\nEarlier today, the San Francisco Unicorns opted to bat first and posted a fighting score of 148 for 7 in their 20 overs. The Unicorns were reeling at 33 for 5 but the partnership of 87 between skipper Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan (44 off 35) brought them back in the game. Corey Anderson remained unbeaten on 59 off just 37 and played a crucial hand to get his side out of trouble. Nosthush Kenjige and Trent Boult took two each for the MI New York side while Shepherd and Rashid Khan chipped in with one apiece. MI New York have slumped to their fourth loss of the season and have just a game in hand.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns started well with the ball but lost their way in the middle phase of the innings. They, however, came back strong and got into the winning position. Brody Couch and Matthew Short shared five wickets among them while Haris Rauf and Hassan Khan chipped with one apiece. San Francisco Unicorns will be delighted with the win as they came back from behind and took the victory from the jaws of defeat. San Francisco Unicorns have qualified for the playoffs and moved to second position in the table.\n\nPhew! What a cliffhanger we've witnessed in Dallas! San Francisco Unicorns held their nerves and won this game by 3 runs in the end. They become the second team after the Washington Freedom to book a place in the playoffs. Chasing a competitive score of 149 for the win, MI New York lost an early wicket of Ruben Clinton but Pooran and Brevis stuck around and added 77 for the second wicket. Dewald Brevis made an attacking fifty and departed on 56 off 36. The wicket of Brevis put the brakes on scoring for MI New York and they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Rashid Khan and Heath Richards swung their bats at the backend but failed to take their team over the line.\n\nW\n\nOvers15.4\n\nScore104 - 5\n\nMatthew Short to Romario Shepherd, HOLES OUT! The plan comes off for the Unicorns and Matthew Short gets his third wicket of the match. Comes from round the wicket and bowls it a touch shorter, sliding into the middle. Romario Shepherd looks to bang bang but does not get the desired connection. He gets the height but not distance and gets caught by Hassan Khan at the deep mid-wicket boundary. MI New York have lost half their side now."

It is an incredible Club, and it was an honour to have represented them.\"\n\n\"Moving onto the next phase of my career, I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to join Major League Cricket and focus my attention on helping to grow the sport in the United States. I've enjoyed a fantastic career with England, and after retiring from international cricket, I am delighted to be able to help build the sport in America in both playing and coaching capacities.\"\n\n\"In addition, I am looking forward to supporting the team closest to our home in the US by being able to play for The Philadelphians in Minor League Cricket,\" he added.\n\nSurrey CCC Director of Cricket, Alec Stewart, said: \"On behalf of everyone at the Club, we wish Liam the very best with his new challenge in America.

Roy’s decision will not effect his future selection prospects, with the batter still England’s incumbent opener in ODI cricket ahead of their World Cup defence in India this autumn.\n\nIn a statement, Roy insisted representing England remained his chief priority.\n\n“I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will ‘walk away from England’,” Roy said. “Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer. I hope to play for England for many more years.”\n\nRoy is set to become the first English player to sign up to the new competition, which takes place in Texas during the final two weeks of July, with reports suggesting he is likely to turn out for the LA Knight Riders, one of six newly-formed teams, four of which are at least partially backed by IPL owners.\n\nRoy has just returned from a stint with Kolkata Knight Riders at the IPL and is set to make his first Surrey appearance of the season in Thursday’s Blast opener against Middlesex at Lord’s.\n\nIt is understood that Roy will still be available for the entirety of Surrey’s Blast campaign, including Finals Day on July 15 should the county get that far, before flying to the US and then returning in time to play for Oval Invincibles in the Hundred.\n\nRoy was demoted to an incremental deal last October, having been dropped by England’s T20 side ahead of their successful World Cup campaign, and will now forgo the remainder of his salary up until the contract was due to expire at the end of September.\n\nIncremental contracts are worth between £60,000 and £70,000 a year and Roy could earn more than twice that amount for just two weeks’ work in the US."

The close contest highlighted the competitive nature of the league, with the Unicorns managing to secure a hard-fought victory.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nMI New York vs San Francisco Unicorns, Match 16\n\nMI New York 145/7 (20 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns 148/7 (20 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns won by 3 runs.\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns secured a thrilling three-run victory over MI New York in a nail-biting encounter of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas.\n\nKey performances included Corey Anderson’s (59*) steady half-century for the Unicorns, Dewald Brevis’ (56) explosive fifty for MI New York, and Pat Cummins’ crucial 19th over for the Unicorns, which helped them defend their total of 148/7, despite Heath Richards’ (23) valiant effort in the final over for MI New York.\n\nMI New York had a staggered start to the run chase as they lost Ruben Clinton (0) to Matthew Short as early as the second over. Opener Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran (26) saw out the powerplay, with MI New York at 31/1.\n\nWhile the required run rate had crept up, MI New York were set for a comfortable run chase with nine wickets in hand. Brevis looked to pick up the pace after the powerplay and found boundaries at will. The 21-year-old brought up his half-century in the ninth over, smashing Pat Cummins for a six and a four to reach the milestone in just 32 balls.\n\nIn the very next over, Brody Couch bagged the crucial wicket of Brevis with the score reading 79/2. Captain Pollard (4) was the next man to fall, trapped LBW by Couch as well. With the required run rate rising, Matthew Short made a vital breakthrough with the wicket of Pooran in the 14th over.\n\nRomario Shepherd (7) and Monank Patel (5) both fell with minimal contributions, leaving MI New York’s Rashid Khan (14*) and Heath Richards with a steep target in the final four overs of the game. Pat Cummins bowled a crucial 19th over, giving away only 5 runs, which was vital for his team’s defense of the total. In the final over, Heath Richards nearly chased the 20 runs needed with two maximums, but Haris Rauf managed to dismiss him on the final delivery, securing a three-run victory for the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns had a dismal start to their innings. In quick succession, they lost Finn Allen (0) and Matthew Short (4) to the bowling of Noshtush Kenjige, while Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis were also sent back to the pavilion early. By the end of the powerplay, the Unicorns were languishing at 28/4.\n\nSherfane Rutherford (15) struck three boundaries before he was run out in the seventh over. It was Hassan Khan (44) and Corey Anderson who executed the repair job for the San Francisco Unicorns. The pair put on 87 runs in 58 balls, with Corey Anderson leading the way with a 33-ball half-century.\n\nHassan Khan fell in the 17th over when he was cleaned up by the crafty Rashid Khan. Pat Cummins (13) joined Corey Anderson and made a brief contribution before becoming Boult’s second scalp of the day. The San Francisco Unicorns finished on 148/7 in 20 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-2 (Finn Allen - 0.3 ov), 2-7 (Sanjay Krishnamurthi - 1.5 ov), 3-7 (Matthew Short - 2.2 ov), 4-19 (Josh Inglis - 5.2 ov), 5-33 (Sherfane Rutherford - 6.6 ov), 6-120 (Hassan Khan - 16.4 ov), 7-145 (Pat Cummins - 19.4 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Fall of wickets: 1-2 (Ruben Clinton - 1.5 ov), 2-79 (Dewald Brevis - 9.6 ov), 3-88 (Kieron Pollard - 12.4 ov), 4-94 (Nicholas Pooran - 13.4 ov), 5-104 (Romario Shepherd - 15.4 ov), 6-108 (Monank Patel - 16.1 ov), 7-145 (Heath Richards - 19.6 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nMI New York\n\nRuben Clinton\n\nMonank Patel\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nDewald Brevis\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nRomario Shepherd\n\nSunny Patel\n\nHeath Richards\n\nRashid Khan\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nTrent Boult\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen\n\nMatthew Short\n\nJosh Inglis(WK)\n\nCorey Anderson(C)\n\nSherfane Rutherford\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nHassan Khan\n\nPat Cummins\n\nLiam Plunkett\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nBrody Couch\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Friday, July 19, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: San Francisco Unicorns elected to bat"

        "body": "MLC 2024 Updated Points Table & Most Runs, Wickets List: San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) defeated MI New York (MINY) in the 16th match of the ongoing Major League Cricket (MLC) on July 19 (as per the Indian standard Time) at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. With their third win of the season in five matches, San Francisco became the second team to qualify for the MLC 2024 playoffs after Washington Freedom. New York on the other hand, find themselves in the second last position in the MLC 2024 points table and their hopes of qualifying look rather weak.\n\nComing to the MINY vs SFU match, San Francisco captain Corey Anderson won the toss and opted to bat first. Batting first, SFU faced early troubles and lost wickets in clumps as they found themselves five wickets down for just 33 runs. However, a partnership between Hassan Khan and Corey Anderson got SFU’s innings back on track as the Unicorns finished at 148 runs in 20 overs.\n\nALSO ON ABP Live | LPL 2024 Eliminator: Kamindu Mendis Produces An 'All-Time Classic' Innings As Kandy Falcons Win A Thriller\n\nChasing 149 runs, MINY’s Dewald Brevis got the team off to a good start despite an early wicket. MINY were well on their course to a comfortable victory as they were 79-2 in 10 overs. However, some disciplined bowling from SFU caused MINY to lose back-to-back wickets and they ultimately finished on 145-7 in 20 overs, losing the game by three runs.\n\nMLC 2024 Updated Points Table After New York vs San Francisco Match\n\nTeams\n\nMat\n\nWon\n\nLost\n\nTied\n\nNR\n\nPts\n\nNRR\n\nWashington Freedom (Q)\n\n5\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n9\n\n2.175\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns (Q)\n\n5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n7\n\n0.081\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n6\n\n1.093\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n-0.569\n\nMI New York\n\n6\n\n1\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\n-0.851\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\n5\n\n1\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n-0.914\n\nMLC 2024 Most Runs After New York vs San Francisco Match\n\n1.

        "body": "oi-Avinash Sharma\n\nMorrisville, July 18: A crucial half-century from Unmukt Chand (62) ensured the Los Angeles Knight Riders defeated the Seattle Orcas by four wickets with five balls to spare in match number 15 of the Major League Cricket 2024 at Church Street Park, Morrisville on Wednesday (July 17).\n\nRyan Rickelton's (89) breathtaking 52-ball knock for the Seattle Orcas was ultimately in vain. LAKR thus secured their second win in six games and now find themselves in the fourth spot in the points table, with Washington Freedom qualified for the playoffs.\n\nChasing a below-par score, the Los Angeles Knight Riders orchestrated a comfortable run chase. Sunil Narine's (8) lean run continued when Spencer Johnson dismissed him in the second over, while Jason Roy (26) and Unmukt Chand (62) went on to build an important partnership. At the end of the powerplay, the Los Angeles Knight Riders were 47/1.\n\nThe 58-run alliance between Roy and Chand was derailed by Harmeet Singh in the 10th over. Unmukt Chand went on to bring up his half-century in 38 deliveries, comprising three sixes and three fours. In the 17th over, Chand fell to Harmeet Singh, but at 120/5, the Knight Riders were in a strong position.\n\nNitish Kumar (12) and Saif Badar (18*) came together for a brief partnership before Andre Russell (10) made a quick contribution to ensure the Los Angeles Knight Riders secured victory with balls to spare. Harmeet Singh (2/27) and Cameron Gannon (2/35) were the pick of the Orcas' bowling efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Seattle Orcas suffered an early setback when Shehan Jayasuriya (2) was dismissed by Corne Dry. Soon after, Quinton de Kock (0) was run out without troubling the scorers.\n\nOpener Ryan Rickelton continued his fine form and quickly accumulated runs as he was joined by Heinrich Klaasen. By the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 36/2, with Rickelton having scored 27 of those runs.\n\nIn the ninth over, Rickelton shifted into another gear, hammering Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a 22-run over. Remarkably, no other batsman besides Rickelton had scored a boundary for the Orcas in the first 10 overs.\n\nRickelton brought up his half-century in just 28 deliveries, featuring five maximums and four boundaries. Meanwhile, Klaasen (23) played a more guarded knock, providing stability at the other end until he was unfortunately run out in the 12th over at 90/3.\n\nWhile Rickelton continued to flourish, striking another six and four boundaries, the lack of support around him meant the Orcas failed to build any more concrete partnerships.\n\nAaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were castled by the experienced Sunil Narine and Andre Russell before Rickelton would eventually perish just shy of a century, dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over. The Seattle Orcas finished on 142/6 in 20 overs."

Despite this, his participation in the remainder of the tournament is now uncertain, although the franchise has yet to issue an official statement regarding his condition.\n\nIn le Roux’s absence, American all-rounder Corey Anderson stepped in to complete the remaining overs.

The Unicorns won the game.\n\nNY vs SF Pitch Report\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas will likely remain balanced throughout this match. The pitch at will be good for batting, however in the previous games we have seen the spinners getting a bit of assistance from the wicket.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium Ground Stats (MLC 2024)\n\nMatches: 6\n\nMatches won batting first: 3\n\nMatches won batting second: 3\n\nAverage first innings total: 163\n\nAverage second innings total: 144\n\nHighest recorded total: 182/5 by Washington Freedoms vs MI New York\n\nLowest recorded total: 88/10 by MI New York vs Washington Freedom\n\nFantasy value from the pitch report\n\nTop-order batters and big-hitters will be good picks for the fantasy contests.\n\nAs far as the bowlers are concerned, go for the fast bowlers from both sides.\n\nAll-rounders with good spin bowling will be rewarding.\n\nNY vs SF Fantasy Cricket Tips\n\nMI New York Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nNicholas Pooran has been in brilliant touch with the bat and will be a must-pick for the game. Besides Pooran, Monank Patel and Romario Shepherd could also be good picks.\n\nRashid Khan will be a great choice as he will be potent on this track with the ball and can also contribute with the bat.\n\nTrent Boult's potential with the new ball makes him a good choice for the fantasy contests.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nMatthew Short and Finn Allen are the in form batters for the Unicorns, and these two would be the safer picks from SFU's batting.\n\nLiam Plunkett, Hassan Khan and Pat Cummins could be the best choices from the Unicorns bowling attack.\n\nNY vs SF Winner Prediction\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns look like a much more balanced and well-rounded team, and as per their performance this season, they are the favourites to win the game.\n\nNY vs SF Top Player Picks\n\nNicholas Pooran (NY)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 111 Runs in 4 Matches\n\nThe West Indian keeper batter is the leading run-scorer for MI New York and has scored 111 runs in three matches at an average of 37.00 and a strike rate of 144.16. Nicholas Pooran will be one of the safest picks for the fantasy contests.\n\nRashid Khan (NY)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 88 Runs and 6 Wickets in 4 Matches\n\nThe Afghan all-rounder is in excellent form currently. Rashid Khan has been a consistent wicket-taker for MINY this season and has also contributed with important runs with the bat lower down the order, which makes him an important choice for the fantasy contests.\n\nMatt Short (SF)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 147 Runs in 3 Matches\n\nThe Australian opening-batter has played three games in the completion so far and has scored two half-centuries in them. With the ability to give his side a solid start, Matt Short can trouble the opposition bowlers and take his team to a comfortable position single-handedly.\n\nLiam Plunkett (SF)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 5 Wickets in 3 Matches\n\nThe English bowler, Liam Plunkett is consistently picking-up wickets for his team in MLC 2024. His current form makes him a good option for the fantasy contests.\n\nNY vs SF Differential Picks\n\nTrent Boult (NY)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 25 Runs and 5 Wickets in 4 Matches\n\nThe Kiwi pacer, Trent Boult is always a lethal customer with the new ball and this gives him the opportunity to be amongst the wickets giving you important points.\n\nFinn Allen (SF)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 107 Runs in 3 Matches\n\nThe Kiwi opener, Finn Allen has been excellent so far in this tournament. However, Allen sometimes suffers from inconsistency and hence is kept in the differential picks section.\n\nNY vs SF Fantasy Expert Advice\n\nConsidering the conditions and probable-XIs, a combination of 2-3-3-3 or 1-3-4-3 would be ideal for this fixture.\n\nNY vs SF Fantasy Team for Head-to-Head/Small Leagues\n\nWicketkeepers: Nicholas Pooran, Monank Patel\n\nBatters: Kieron Pollard, Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk\n\nAll-rounders: Matt Short, Rashid Khan, Hassan Khan\n\nBowlers: Trent Boult, Liam Plunkett, Brody Couch\n\nCaptain: Finn Allen\n\nVice-captain: Rashid Khan\n\nMI New York: 5 Players; San Francisco Unicorns: 6 Players\n\nNY vs SF Fantasy Team for Winner Takes All/ Grand Leagues\n\nWicketkeepers: Nicholas Pooran\n\nBatters: Kieron Pollard, Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk\n\nAll-rounders: Matt Short, Rashid Khan, Hassan Khan, Romario Shepherd\n\nBowlers: Trent Boult, Liam Plunkett, Brody Couch\n\nCaptain: Matt Short\n\nVice-captain: Nicholas Pooran"

        "body": "Mumbai, July 19: The San Francisco Unicorns secured a thrilling three-run victory over MI New York in a nail-biting encounter of Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas. Key performances included Corey Anderson's (59*) steady half-century for the Unicorns, Dewald Brevis' (56) explosive fifty for MI New York, and Pat Cummins' crucial 19th over for the Unicorns, which helped them defend their total of 148/7, despite Heath Richards' (23) valiant effort in the final over for MI New York. MLC 2024: Ryan Rickelton’s Heroics Goes in Vain As LA Knight Riders Seal Four-Wicket Win Against Seattle Orcas.\n\nMI New York had a staggered start to the run chase as they lost Ruben Clinton (0) to Matthew Short as early as the second over. Opener Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran (26) saw out the powerplay, with MI New York at 31/1. While the required run rate had crept up, MI New York were set for a comfortable run chase with nine wickets in hand.\n\nBrevis looked to pick up the pace after the powerplay and found boundaries at will. The 21-year-old brought up his half-century in the ninth over, smashing Pat Cummins for a six and a four to reach the milestone in just 32 balls. In the very next over, Brody Couch bagged the crucial wicket of Brevis with the score reading 79/2. Captain Pollard (4) was the next man to fall, trapped LBW by Couch as well.\n\nWith the required run rate rising, Matthew Short made a vital breakthrough with the wicket of Pooran in the 14th over. Romario Shepherd (7) and Monank Patel (5) both fell with minimal contributions, leaving MI New York's Rashid Khan (14*) and Heath Richards with a steep target in the final four overs of the game.\n\nPat Cummins bowled a crucial 19th over, giving away only 5 runs, which was vital for his team's defense of the total. In the final over, Heath Richards nearly chased the 20 runs needed with two maximums, but Haris Rauf managed to dismiss him on the final delivery, securing a three-run victory for the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns had a dismal start to their innings. In quick succession, they lost Finn Allen (0) and Matthew Short (4) to the bowling of Noshtush Kenjige, while Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis were also sent back to the pavilion early. By the end of the powerplay, the Unicorns were languishing at 28/4. MI New York Suffers Huge 94-Run Loss Against Washington Freedom in MLC 2024.\n\nSherfane Rutherford (15) struck three boundaries before he was run out in the seventh over. It was Hassan Khan (44) and Corey Anderson who executed the repair job for the San Francisco Unicorns. The pair put on 87 runs in 58 balls, with Corey Anderson leading the way with a 33-ball half-century.\n\nHassan Khan fell in the 17th over when he was cleaned up by the crafty Rashid Khan. Pat Cummins (13) joined Corey Anderson and made a brief contribution before becoming Boult's second scalp of the day. The San Francisco Unicorns finished on 148/7 in 20 overs.\n\nBrief Scores: San Francisco Unicorns 148/7 (Corey J Anderson 59, Hassan Khan 44, Noshtush Kenjige 2/13, Trent Boult 2/35) beat MI New York 145/7 (Dewald Brevis 56, Nicholas Pooran 26, Matthew Short 3/27, Brody Couch 2/27)."

        "body": "LAKR all-rounder Andre Russell struck one of his trademark straight sixes, in the ending parts of the Major League Cricket 2024 match between Los Angeles Knight Riders and Seattle Orcas in Morrisville. At that point, LAKR had lost their fifth wicket while chasing a target of 143, needing 23 runs off the remaining 20 deliveries when Russell came in to bat.\n\nWith a towering six, the 36-year-old sealed the game by launching a slower leg-cutter from Cameron Gannon straight onto the sightscreen. This decisive shot brought the score to 11 off 11, effectively coming close to the victory.\n\nEven though he was eventually out for 10 off 7 after two balls, the thunderous hit had already done the damage.\n\nLAKR secured victory by four wickets after Russell’s dismissal on the first ball of the final over. With one match left in the round-robin phase, this victory maintained their chances of making the playoffs, placing them in fourth position with five points from six games.\n\nIn the tournament so far, Russell has been inconsistent, scoring 94 runs at a modest average of 23.50 and a high strike rate of 159.32 across five innings. The 36-year-old all-rounder has also struggled to take wickets, claiming just one scalp with figures of 1/15 in four overs in this match.\n\nNeeding a win to keep their playoff hopes alive, LAKR took on SOR. Russell, breaking out of his wicket-taking slump, delivered a sensational spell of 1/15 in 4 overs, restricting SOR to a modest total of 142/6 in 20 overs.\n\nIn the 18th over, he dismissed the dangerous Michael Bracewell, stalling SOR’s late surge. Later, Russell’s crucial six helped LAKR end their three-game losing streak and secure the victory.\n\nA victory over MI New York (MINY) in their final round-robin matchup would all but secure a playoff spot. The two teams are set to face off in Dallas on Sunday, July 21."

Washington Freedom chased down the target in just 16 overs, losing only two wickets and winning the game by eight wickets.\n\nWashington Freedom shared the video of Maxwell’s generous act on their official X handle, captioning it, “The winner of the hearts award goes to Glenn Maxwell, who graciously gave his POTM award to his fan.”\n\nAfter the game, Maxwell talked about his performance and the favorable conditions for bowlers. He also expressed his relief at not having to bat.\n\n“We're fortunate with the conditions and Saurabh picking wickets at top. It was nice to get some help from the wicket. There was little bit of spin, little bit of inconsistency. It was a good day and nice to go at the top as well. I'm absolutely loving not having to bat; great to give my body a bit of rest. Smudge (Steve Smith) is doing a great job as a leader and opener, very fortunate to have him,” Maxwell said in the post-match presentation ceremony."

The MLC 2024 game will be available to watch via live streaming and broadcast.\n\nThe top two teams in the points table after the group stage will meet each other in the Qualifier, with the winning team getting a chance to directly advance to the final.\n\nCurrently, we are on top of the MLC 2024 points table with nine points from five games. A win will help us continue our unbeaten run this season along with guaranteeing a place in the top two of the standings.\n\nWe defeated MI New York by a mammoth 94 runs in our last game in Dallas on Tuesday, with Jasdeep Singh making a memorable debut for us in MLC with a three-wicket haul. Travis Head and Andries Gous also shone with half-centuries.\n\nThough Saurabh Netravalkar did not feature in our last match, he continues to be on top of the bowling charts for MLC 2024. The left-arm pacer has 12 wickets from four matches at an average of 9.16 and a strike rate of 7.66. Lockie Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell also feature in the top five of the wicket-takers list with nine and six wickets, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Travis Head, after scoring consecutive fifties in the last two matches, is on top of our run-getters list, with captain Steve Smith in second place. Head has accumulated 141 runs at an average of 35.25 and a strike rate of 163.95 to find a place in the top ten of the overall batting charts, along with Smith.\n\nWF vs TSK form in MLC\n\nWe enter this game with four wins from the last five matches in MLC 2024, with our previous game against Texas Super Kings getting washed off due to rain.\n\nWashington Freedom's last five matches\n\nOpponent\n\nVenue\n\nResult\n\nMatch Date\n\nMargin\n\nMINY\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\n94 runs\n\nLAKR\n\nMorrisville\n\nWon\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\n8 wickets\n\nSO\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\n5 wickets\n\nTSK\n\nMorrisville\n\nNo Result\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\n-\n\nMINY\n\nMorrisville\n\nWon\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\n4 runs (DLS)\n\nWF vs TSK, MLC 2024: Players to watch out\n\nJasdeep Singh, who came into the side as a replacement for Netravalkar in our last match against MINY, made an instant impact with career-best T20 figures of 3/14 in three overs. He was a tricky customer, surprising batters with his pace and bounce.\n\nJasdeep bowled 13 dot balls in his spell, piling pressure on the MINY middle order, who succumbed to the rising scoring rate. Ferguson also chipped in with two crucial wickets to skittle MINY.\n\nMeanwhile, Andries Gous scored his first fifty in MLC to anchor our batting and powered us to a dominant total of 182/5 batting first. Coming in to bat during the powerplay, Gous scored 59 off 48 balls before being dismissed on the last ball of the innings.\n\nThe fact that three of Gous’ four sixes came against leg spinner Rashid Khan speaks to his class and big-hitting ability. Travis Head displayed his attacking game yet again with a 33-ball 54 to give us a steady start and a solid foundation to go big in the death overs.\n\nThe Australian duo of Head and Smith were severe on the Texas Super Kings bowling attack chasing 204, in their last meeting on July 9. But unfortunately, rain played spoilsport as we were well-placed at 62/0 after just four overs.\n\nWashington Freedom squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs TSK MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nLIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs Texas Super Kings match will be available on Monumental Sports Network and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA.

        "date": "Tue Jul 16 11:21:40 2024",
        "body": "BY Kyle Marie McMahon\n\nCognizant Major League Cricket (MLC) opened its 2024 season in Morrisville on July 5. Despite the sweltering heat, the community packed Church Street Park (5800 Cricket Pitch Way) to watch MI New York defeat the Seattle Orcas by six wickets.\n\nThis is just the second season for MLC, which has six teams. MI New York won the inaugural title last year, and while the players hope for a repeat, Head Coach Robin Peterson says, “Last year is last year. Yes, it’s nice to come into a tournament as defending champions, but everybody starts on no points again. We’re very cognizant of the fact we’ve got to go and earn it again and play some good cricket if we’re going to be successful in this competition.”\n\nMLC is a Twenty20 league, which is a shortened format of cricket, designed to be played in a few hours rather than five days. If you are new to the sport, the rules may feel intimidating, but upon arrival, the league provides you with a handout to explain the scoring. For those familiar with baseball, it can be helpful to use it as a comparison for understanding the basics.\n\nAs in baseball, there is a fielding team and a batting team. Imagine the area from home plate to the pitcher’s mound. In cricket, this is called the pitch. There is still a pitcher (called a bowler) and a catcher (called a wicket-keeper), but instead of bases, cricket has “wickets,” which are three stumps with connecting sticks on top. The remainder of the fielding team is in the circular field that surrounds the pitch. The fielding team’s goal is to dismiss batters (get an out), which can be done by breaking the wickets or fielding the ball.\n\nThe batting team’s goal is to protect the wicket and hit the ball for runs. Two batters take the pitch at a time, standing at opposite wickets. Only one batter will hit the ball, but both will run, and each time they cross the pitch to the opposite wicket, a run is scored. As with all sports, there are special rules around batting, fielding and scoring, but you don’t need to know them all to start enjoying the game.\n\nAnd with continued investment in Church Street Park, you can expect interest in the sport to continue to grow. Harmeet Singh Baddhan, bowler for the Orcas, loves getting to play here. He says, “Every time we come here, it’s such good hospitality. People love cricket out here. It’s a smaller community, but there’s a lot of love for the game.”\n\nIt’s been an exciting and tight race this season, which was expanded to 21 matches, up from 15 last season. Washington Freedom is in first place with seven points, but there are still plenty of games to play. You can still catch the last game in North Carolina on July 17 at 3 p.m. before the season wraps in Grand Prairie, Texas. The round-robin playoffs will start July 24, with the championship game commencing on July 28 at Grand Prairie Stadium. Don’t stress if you weren’t able to make it to a game: the Minor League Cricket season, where you can watch our very own Morrisville Raptors play at Church Street Park, will start soon after."

        "body": "The Major League Cricket saw a scary moment take place, as fast-bowler Carmi le Roux was hit on the head by a hard shot from batter Ryan Rickleton. San Francisco Unicorns bowler le Roux was bowling his second over when Seattle Orcas batter Rickleton's shot caught him by surprise and slammed onto his head. The nasty blow left le Roux's face completely bloodied. Thankfully, le Roux was still in his senses despite the hit, and walked off without any help from his teammates.\n\nBowling the third over of the game, South African Le Roux was smashed on the head by a shot from compatriot Rickleton. Rickleton, a left-handed, had looked to hit it straight, but the shot ended up going straight at the bowler.\n\nWatch: Scary moment in MLC as Carmi le Roux gets hit on the head\n\nMedical staff were rushed on to the ground, but to everyone's relief, le Roux was able to walk off on his own.\n\nSeattle Orcas at the bottom\n\nAfter le Roux was taken off, former New Zealand and current USA all-rounder Corey Anderson completed the over. Defending 165, the San Francisco Unicorns were able to restrict Seattle Orcas to just 142, despite missing le Roux.\n\nFormer England pacer Liam Plunkett, 39, was the pick of the bowlers, ending the game with figures of 3/26 in four overs.\n\nAfter that game, the Seattle Orcas suffered another defeat two days later, this time to Los Angeles Knight Riders. This left the Orcas at the bottom of the Major League Cricket (MLC) season two table. Their fortunes this season are a stark contrast to the previous season, when they had topped the table.\n\nOrcas are currently on just one victory in five games. Defending champions MI New York are also in trouble, sitting fifth and outside the playoff spots.\n\nThe tournament started on July 5, 2024, and the final is set to be played on July 28.\n\nTopics mentioned in this article"

        "body": "Cricket\n\n-OneArabia\n\nUnmukt Chand's crucial half-century (62) led the Los Angeles Knight Riders to a four-wicket victory over the Seattle Orcas in match 15 of Major League Cricket 2024 at Church Street Park, Morrisville. The win came with five balls remaining on Wednesday (July 17).\n\nDespite Ryan Rickelton's impressive 89 off 52 balls for the Seattle Orcas, his efforts were in vain. The Los Angeles Knight Riders secured their second win in six games, moving to fourth place on the points table. Washington Freedom has already qualified for the playoffs.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders chased a below-par score comfortably. Sunil Narine's lean run continued as Spencer Johnson dismissed him in the second over. However, Jason Roy (26) and Unmukt Chand (62) formed a vital partnership, taking the team to 47/1 by the end of the powerplay.\n\nThe partnership between Roy and Chand added 58 runs before Harmeet Singh broke it in the 10th over. Chand reached his half-century in 38 balls, hitting three sixes and three fours. Although he fell to Harmeet Singh in the 17th over, leaving LAKR at 120/5, they remained in control.\n\nEarlier, Seattle Orcas faced early setbacks when Corne Dry dismissed Shehan Jayasuriya (2), followed by Quinton de Kock's run-out without scoring. By the end of the powerplay, they were at 36/2, with Rickelton contributing 27 runs.\n\nRickelton accelerated in the ninth over, smashing Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a single over. He reached his half-century off just 28 balls with five sixes and four boundaries.\n\nLack of Support for Rickelton\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (23) provided some stability but was run out in the 12th over at 90/3. Despite Rickelton's continued aggression, hitting another six and four boundaries, other batsmen failed to support him adequately.\n\nAaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were bowled by Sunil Narine and Andre Russell respectively. Rickelton was eventually dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over, leaving Seattle Orcas at 142/6 after their allotted overs.\n\nFinal Push by LAKR\n\nNitish Kumar (12) and Saif Badar (18*) formed a brief partnership before Andre Russell contributed a quickfire 10 runs. This ensured that Los Angeles Knight Riders achieved their target with balls to spare. Harmeet Singh (2/27) and Cameron Gannon (2/35) were notable performers for Seattle Orcas.\n\nBrief Score:\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders:143/6(Unmukt Chand 62, Jason Roy 27; Harmeet Singh 2/27, Cameron Gannon 2/25)Seattle Orcas:142/6(Ryan Rickelton 82, Heinrich Klaasen 23; Corne Dry 1/8, Andre Russell 1/15)Result:Los Angeles Knight Riders won by four wickets\n\nStory first published: Thursday, July 18, 2024, 13:24 [GST]"
