        "body": "Australians Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell played starring roles to help the Washington Freedom dismantle the San Francisco Unicorns by 96 runs at the Grand Prairie Stadium on Sunday to claim their maiden Major League Cricket title.\n\nUnicorns captain Corey Anderson won the toss and put the Freedom in to bat, a decision he was made to regret in the end as Washington piled up 207-5 from their 20 overs.\n\nCaptain Smith starred with a 52-ball 88 including seven fours and six sixes while Maxwell made 40 off 22 balls including one four and four sixes against 2-35 off four overs from Pat Cummins.\n\nThe Freedom then produced a dominant performance with the ball as well, dismissing the Unicorns for 111 in 16 overs to claim the title.\n\nTail-ender Carmi le Roux was the highest scorer in the innings with 20* as Rachin Ravindra and Marco Jansen took 3-23 from four overs and 3-28 from four overs, respectively.\n\nAndrew Tye was also excellent with 2-12 from his two overs.\n\nThe Freedom are rightfully champions having suffered only one loss all season.\n\nFull Scores:\n\nWashington Freedom 207-5 off 20 overs (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2-35)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns 111 all out off 16 overs (Carmi ls Roux 20*, Rachin Ravindra 3-23, Marco Jansen 3-28)\n\nThe Republic Bank Caribbean Premier League (CPL) has announced the formation of a new Health, Fitness, and Wellbeing Advisory Board, with the aim of promoting healthy living initiatives throughout the Caribbean region. The board, which will meet quarterly with senior CPL staff, includes prominent figures such as West Indies men's white-ball coach Darren Sammy and West Indies women's captain Hayley Matthews.\n\nThe advisory board also features Dr. Akshai Mansingh, CPL’s Joint Chief Medical Officer, and Dr. Maryam Abdool-Richards, Principal Medical Officer at the Trinidad & Tobago Ministry of Health. This diverse team of experts is tasked with advising the CPL on leveraging its platform to create and promote health and wellness programs.\n\nPete Russell, CPL’s CEO, expressed enthusiasm about the initiative, stating, \"Health, fitness, and wellbeing are very important issues across the Caribbean and around the world, and we want to use cricket and our platform as a force for good in this area. We are looking forward to working with the advisory board to create meaningful and long-lasting programs that have a positive impact on health and wellbeing across the region. Starting this season, there will be activities at the games that will create a fun vibe around health and fitness, allowing everyone to join in and be part of it.\"\n\nDarren Sammy, the newly appointed West Indies men's head coach, emphasized the importance of health and wellbeing, especially for young people. \"The health and wellbeing of the Caribbean people is hugely important to me, especially our young people who we work very hard through my foundation. I am excited to be involved in this great initiative from CPL and I look forward to being involved in creating meaningful programs that come from this new collaboration.\"\n\nHayley Matthews, West Indies women's captain and a passionate advocate for women's and girls' participation in sports, shared her enthusiasm as well. \"I am passionate about women and girls across the Caribbean being involved in sport and fitness, and I am looking forward to working with the Health and Wellbeing Advisory Board and CPL to create initiatives that will encourage participation. As someone who manages a sporting career while suffering with diabetes, I hope that I can add a unique perspective to the discussions.\"\n\nThe CPL's Health, Fitness, and Wellbeing Advisory Board represents a significant step towards integrating health and wellness into the fabric of Caribbean cricket, ensuring that the sport not only entertains but also contributes positively to the community. The upcoming season will see the introduction of various activities at games designed to promote a fun and engaging atmosphere around health and fitness, inviting fans and participants alike to join in and be part of this initiative.\n\nBrendon McCullum is satisfied with England's progression, but the Test coach says his team know they are not \"the finished article\" just yet.\n\nEngland wrapped up a 3-0 series win over West Indies on Sunday, as Ben Stokes and Mark Wood starred in a 10-wicket victory at Edgbaston.\n\nIt was a memorable series for England, as James Anderson retired following the first Test, while paceman Gus Atkinson showed that there is plenty of hope for the future.\n\n\"I thought, overall, it was a progression of where we wanted to get to as a team,\" coach McCullum told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We're not the finished article – we know that. But I think this series has been a step forward for us. It has been a while for us to get a series win and we'll never take that for granted.\"\n\nJamie Smith also impressed, and McCullum was quick to hail the wicketkeeper.\n\n\"When you’re in that position at seven and wicketkeeper you're like the drummer in the band,\" he said.\n\n\"You need to be prepared to take risks and he's happy to do that, and he backs himself that he's got the power game when the field is out.\n\n\"No [criticism of] guys that have been before, they've done great jobs for us, but we identified that it was an area where we wanted to add a little bit more punch.\"\n\nOf Atkinson, who took 22 wickets across the three matches, McCullum added: \"He's such a quiet man. He’s got inner confidence and a real confidence in his ability and skills.\n\n\"He's moved the ball off the seam both ways, hits great lengths, bowled high pace and committed to the bouncer plan and done what the captain asked and sustained it.\n\n\"He's been outstanding and he's quite cheeky within the group too and the guys love him.\"\n\nCaptain Stokes, meanwhile, also took on a starring role in the final Test, as he plundered England's quickest Test half-century, knocking off 50 in just 28 balls."

        "date": "Thu Jul 25 15:30:00 2024",
        "body": "When the first season of Major League Cricket came to a close, the Seattle Orcas showed their class. This year, the result was much different for the team of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSeattle fell in its final match of MLC 2 to the Texas Super Kings, losing by 37 runs.\n\nIt capped a horrid season for the green and gray, as the Orcas managed just two points and finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nSeattle is very South African heavy with its international players, who are coming off a world cup semifinal appearance. To say there were tired legs, would be stating the obvious. “Most of our pros came over straight from the world cup. Even if they won’t agree, they looked a little bit exhausted,” said Orcas All-Rounder Harmeet Singh.\n\nSome of the best South African cricketers have been playing without more than a week’s break for over four months.\n\nThis season just wasn’t to be for the Orcas. Like Seattle’s other bat-to-ball franchise, the Mariners, the Orcas could not put consistent runs on the board.\n\nOver the course of the seven games played this season, Seattle batted second in three of them and chased runs successfully in their lone victory. But when the Orcas were required to put up a high number, Seattle continuously dropped the ball.\n\nWhen opening with the batting, the Orcas have won just one game in their two years of existence. It was all the way back on July 15, 2023, in a win over San Fransisco. But since then, Seattle has lost seven in a row when opening with the paddle.\n\nDespite quite literally nothing bouncing the way of the Orcas in year two, in the final match there looked to be some positives. Ayan Desai made his MLC and Orcas debut taking the ball to start the first over.\n\nWith his first ball he took the wicket of a top-class cricketer in Devon Conway via leg before wicket. That ball was later named the play of the game and was the start of a great first match for Desai.\n\nHe finished with 2 wickets and 30 runs, and an economy of 7.50 which was the third lowest of all bowlers in the game.\n\nIt was just a bleak day with the bat for the Orcas after holding the Super Kings to a pretty manageable 177 after the first innings.\n\nSeattle knew it was going to have to work hard after its top run-scorer Ryan Rickleton was dismissed for a golden duck for the second straight match. Rickleton looked to be the bright spot of the Orca’s 2024 season scoring a century and spent a lot of time on the top of the run scoring table, but in his last two matches never saw a second ball.\n\nNo Orca scored more than 26 runs (Quentin de Kock 19 balls), which pales in comparison to the Super Kings’ three players who scored over 29 in the match.\n\nIt is a season to forget based on results for the Orcas, but MLC season 2 is a year to look back on as the sport of cricket continues to grow in the United States."

        "date": "Mon Jul 29 04:42:00 2024",
        "body": "Smith, Maxwell and Head lead the charge for Washington, who lost just one game in MLC 2024\n\nWashington Freedom 207 for 5 (Smith 88, Maxwell 40) beat San Francisco Unicorns 111 (Ravindra 3-23, Jansen 3-28) by 96 runs\n\nSteven Smith led Washington Freedom to the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 title as they romped to an overwhelming 96-run victory against San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. Smith and Australia team-mate Glenn Maxwell dominated with the bat then Unicorns' chase disintegrated with Marco Jansen claiming both openers among his three wickets.\n\nThe result cemented Freedom's standing as the team of the season having secured five wins in the group stage before progressing direct to the final with victory over Unicorns in the Qualifier. This contest turned their way through a stand of 83 off 39 balls between Smith and Maxwell as Freedom added 121 in the second half of their innings.\n\nSmith, who was overlooked for Australia's T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, overcame a sluggish start in the powerplay to make 88 off 52 balls including six sixes. Having been 10 off 12 balls in the sixth over he sped to a 34-ball fifty and ended the season as the joint second-leading run-scorer, alongside Travis Head, with 336 at a strike-rate of 148.67.\n\nHead, who has struck at over 170 during the tournament, fell early to Pat Cummins when he edged to slip, where Finn Allen held on at the second attempt, having been given a life in the opening over. But Andries Gous gave Freedom's innings impetus as Smith found his feet although when Haris Rauf removed Rachin Ravindra after the midway mark, it was an even contest at 86 for 3.\n\nThen Smith and Maxwell, the latter having found form in the closing stages of the tournament, took charge included 28 coming off the 13th over from Juanoy Drysdale. Smith produced an outrageous scoop for six off Rauf and was in sight of a century when he got a top edge off Cummins.\n\nIt appears likely that Smith's T20I career is over following his World Cup omission and absence from the squad to face Scotland and England in September as the selectors look to the future, but it has been a profitable few weeks for him in the US.\n\nThough Maxwell also fell in the next over, superbly caught by Josh Inglis, Freedom were still able to cross 200.\n\nUnicorns' chase never got off the ground. Jake Fraser-McGurk's low-key tournament ended when he edged into the stumps against Jansen to leave him with 81 runs at 11.57 then both Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Allen also fell inside the powerplay to leave a daunting task. Sherfane Rutherford was superbly caught at deep backward square by Ian Holland the ball after being dropped and the rest of the batting fell away amid a huge asking rate.\n\nFreedom's victory gave Ricky Ponting a title as coach a couple of weeks after leaving his role with Delhi Capitals.\n\nAndrew McGlashan is a deputy editor at ESPNcricinfo"

This match will be played on July 29 at 6:00 AM IST.\n\nTeam Previews\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nThe Washington Freedom have played the best cricket in the tournament. They won five of their seven matches in the league stage and finished at the top of the table. They went on to win the Qualifier against the San Francisco Unicorns and make it to the summit clash of the tournament.\n\nThe Steve Smith-led team has played all-round cricket so far. While Steve Smith and Travis Head have been giving them great starts at the top of the innings, bowlers like Saurabh Netravalkar and Lockie Ferguson have put them ahead in the games with their super efficient bowling. The team will be looking to do it one last time and become the second team to lay their hands on the coveted trophy.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nWhile the Washington Freedom have played the best cricket in the tournament, the San Francisco Unicorns have been a close second. While the Freedom have played all-round cricket, the Unicorns have been led well by their skipper Corey Anderson.\n\nFinn Allenn has given them great starts at the top of the order and for the majority of the tournament was aided by the presence of Matt Short. The Aussie top-order batter however as went away to play The Hundred and will not be available for this game. So, the onus will be on Allen to give them a significant start. However, players like Hassan Khan and Sanjay Krishnamurthi have stepped in the last couple of games. As far as the bowling efforts are concerned, it has been a team effort and they would be hoping to do it one last time.\n\nWAS vs SF: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nWAS vs SF: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at the Grand Prairie Stadium has been a sporty one. While the batters have enjoyed playing stroke against the hard and new ball, the bowlers have had to use their variations to be successful here.

Led by a stellar performance from Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell, Freedom set an imposing target of 208, which proved too steep for the Unicorns to chase in the match on Sunday. In need of a strong start, the Unicorns were immediately on the back foot. Jake Fraser-McGurk (3) was dismissed early in the third over, and Marco Jansen (3/28) struck a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen (13), who scored a century in the qualifier. With the score at 30/3, the Unicorns were in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued as Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) fell early, extinguishing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, who was brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, further tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then cleaned out the tail with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the ultimate match of the tournament, the team from Washington lost Head (9) early. Then, Steve Smith (88 in 52 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) took centre stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock.\n\nHe found support in Andries Gous (21 in 14 balls, with three fours and a six), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, finding the boundary with ease.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40 in 22 balls, with a four and four sixes) joined Smith and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as both Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith's departure, followed shortly by Maxwell's, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. The Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) beat San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs\n\nTOURNAMENT AWARDS:\n\nWINNERS: Washington Freedom\n\nRUNNERS-UP: San Francisco Unicorns\n\nMOST VALUABLE PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Travis Head (Washington Freedom): 336 runs in nine matches at an average of 48.00, strike rate of over 173 and five fifties.\n\nLEADING RUN SCORER: Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings): 420 runs in eight innings at an average of 52.50, with a strike rate of over 171 and a century and three fifties.\n\nLEADING WICKET TAKER: Saurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom): 15 wickets\n\nDOMESTIC PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Hassan Khan (San Francisco Unicorns): 204 runs in eight innings at an average of 40.80, with a fifty and 10 wickets.

The San Franciso Unicorns posted a challenging total of 200/6, thanks to a vital innings from Finn Allen (101 in 53 balls, with nine fours and five sixes) that set the stage for a thrilling chase where the Texas Super Kings fell just short at 190/4. Following the day's result, the Texas Super Kings will take on the Washington Freedom on Sunday, as per a press release from MLC.\n\nFinn Allen's explosive 101 off 53, including nine boundaries and five sixes, set the tone for the Unicorns. Allen's aggressive play during the powerplay provided the Unicorns with the momentum they needed, bringing them to a powerplay score of 66/0. Despite Noor Ahmed's quick wickets of Jake Fraser 'McGurk (18) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (0), Josh Inglis added a crucial 37 from 25 deliveries to support Allen through the innings. Fin Allen's exploits included a 16 run over of Marcus Stoinis on two occasions, the second and the 13th over, and an 18 run over of Zia Ul Haq, comprising two consecutive sixes.\n\nHassan Khan's quick 27 off 15 balls, with four boundaries and a six, was also vital in propelling the Unicorns to the 200-run mark. For the Texas Super Kings, Noor Ahmad was the standout bowler, capturing key wickets and finishing with figures of 3/27.\n\nIn response, the Texas Super Kings opened strong, with Devon Conway (62* in 38 balls, with seven fours and a six) leading the pursuit. Faf du Plessis contributed a brisk 45 off 22, with seven fours and a six, but his dismissal derailed the Texas Super Kings' momentum following a 55-run opening stand. While middle-order contributions from Aaron Hardie (19), Milind Kumar (2) and Marcus Stoinis (1) were lacking, Joshua Tromp, scored a breezy 56 from 36 balls, and kept the Super Kings in the hunt until the final over.\n\nConway brought up his half century in only 30 balls, whereas Tromp powered his way to the milestone in 31 deliveries, including four fours and two sixes. The match came down to the wire in the last five overs, with the Texas Super Kings needing 64 runs. With the dangerous Conway and Tromp at the crease, Haris Rauf and Pat Cummins held their nerves for the San Franciso Unicorns, delivering tight overs under pressure. Cummins was pivotal in the 20th over, conceding only 7 runs when 18 were needed, showcasing experienced death bowling that ensured a Unicorns' victory. Juanoy Drysdale emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the innings with figures of 2/33.\n\nBrief Scores: San Francisco Unicorns: 200/6 in 20 overs (Finn Allen 101, Josh Inglis 37, Noor Ahmad 3/27) Texas Super Kings: 190/4 in 20 overs (Devon Conway 62*, Joshua Tromp 56, Juanoy Drysdale 2/33).
