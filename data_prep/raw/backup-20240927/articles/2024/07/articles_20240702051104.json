The first match of the tournament will be a rematch of the finals of the previous edition, where the Seattle Orcas will take on the MI-New York.\n\nThe Orcas will be looking to repeat their antics from the previous edition and try to go one better and lift the trophy this time. Before they begin their campaign, let us take a look at their team and try to analyse it.\n\nHere is a look at the Seattle Orcas team for the MLC 2024.\n\nBatters: Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, Hammad Azam, Nauman Anwar\n\nAll-rounders: Michael Bracewell, Harmeet Singh, Imad Wasim, Shehan Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjane\n\nBowlers: Ali Sheikh, Nandre Burger, Cameron Gannon, Wayne Parnell, Ayan Desai, Zaman Khan\n\nStrengths of Seattle Orcas for MLC 2024\n\nHeinrich Klaasen and Quinton de Kock will be the strength of the Seattle Orcas batting [X]\n\nPower in batting\n\nQuinton de Kock will add power to the team's batting in the top order. The presence of Heinrich Klaasen will give them the fuel to finish off on a string note.\n\nAlongside these two superstars, they have the likes of Nauman Anwar, Michael Bracewell and Imad Wasim, who could stabilise the innings in the middle overs for the team.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas look like a team that has the proper mix of big hitters and middle-order stabilisers to see their team do well in this edition of the tournament.\n\nQuinton de Kock will add power to the team's batting in the top order. The presence of Heinrich Klaasen will give them the fuel to finish off on a string note.\n\nVariety and depth in the spin department\n\nThe presence of Harmeet Singh, Imad Wasim, and Michael Bracewell will provide great depth and variety to the spin department. These players can also contribute with the bat, adding further dynamism and flexibility to the team.\n\nWell-rounded pace department\n\nCameron Gannon was in great form in the last edition. He played a great role in the team's run to the final. Along with Gannon, Nandre Burger and Wayne Parnell look like a formidable pace attack. These bowlers can deliver at all stages of the game, and hence, the teams look sorted as far as their pace department is concerned.\n\nWeaknesses of Seattle Orcas for MLC 2024\n\nLack of experience and skill in the middle order\n\nA lot of the Seattle Orcas middle-order depends on Heinrich Klaasen. The South African batter will play a major role in carrying the team ahead. The other batters around Klaasen are Imad Wasim, Hammad Azam and Michael Bracewell. While there is a lack of experience in some of these players in crucial stages, the others are not in the best of forms. So, the middle order of the team looks a bit fragile and may succumb under pressure.\n\nSeattle Orcas Predicted XI for the first match"

With the marquee international event now over, the focus of the T20 format shifts back to the franchise leagues around the world.\n\nAfter the superb show of the US team in the recently concluded world event, a lot of the eyes will be focused on how they progress from here. The second edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC 2024) is, therefore, the next big thing in the cricketing calendar of 2024.\n\nWe at OneCricket will take a look at all the teams that will participate in the tournament and try to analyse them. In this article, we will take a look at the Los Angeles Knight Riders team and their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nHere is a look at the Los Angeles Kinght Riders team for the tournament.\n\nBatters: Adithya Ganesh, Unmukt Chand, Nitish Kumar, Jason Roy, Saif Badar, Alex Carey, David Miller\n\nAll-rounders: Sunil Narine, Corne Dry, Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan, Matthew Tromp, Shadley van Shcalwyk\n\nBowlers: Ali Khan, Derone Davis, Spencer Johnson, Adam Zampa\n\nStrengths of Los Angeles Knight Riders for MLC 2024\n\nVariety and depth in the all-rounder section\n\nThe likes of Sunil Narine, Andre Russell and Shakib Al Hasan have been doing the rounds of T20 circuits for long. The presence of these three players not only allows the team management to have great dynamism and depth in the team but also gives them a lot of experience. The team will be depending a lot on these three legends of the format to have a much better campaign than last time, where they finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nSpencer Johnson will play a major role for LAKR in the tournament [X]\n\nWell sorted and assembeled bowling attack\n\nAndre Russell and Sunil Narine will give LAKR the flexibility to use them at any stage of the game. Alongside these two, Spencer Johnson is a solid option for the powerplays. They also have Adam Zampa and Shakib Al Hasan for the middle overs, and in the end, they have Ali Khan, who can be very efficient in the death overs. So, the bowling looks ready for all the phases of the game, and there is also plenty of strength and variety in it to go with.\n\nWeaknesses of Los Angeles Knight Riders for MLC 2024\n\nVolatile top-order\n\nIf the Knight Riders are not opening with Sunil Narine, then they have Unmukt Chand, Nitish Kumar and Jason Roy to open with. While Jason Roy looks like a good option, his lack of consistency is a concern for the team. Besides Roy, the likes of Chand and Kumar do not look like outright match-winners, and this can haunt the team during the campaign.\n\nThe team will depend a lot on the likes of David Miller and Alex Carey to give them stability and the strength in the middle-order.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Predicted XI for the First Match"

Each player has been on a different individual journey to get to this first final,” he said after he was asked about the emotions in the team straight after losing in Barbados.\n\n“Ultimately you become really tight as a group and you want good things to happen to this group because you know they’re great people and when you get really close like that, especially the nature of how the game went, obviously adds to the emotions and it’s one of those things. But yeah, we can channel it moving forward.”"

With a couple of days left at the start of the tournament, we at OneCricket will take a deeper delve into the MI New York side.\n\nThe MI New York played excellent cricket in the previous edition. Even after an average start to their campaign, MINY peaked at the right moment and made it to the summit clash of the tournament. In the final, Nicholas Pooran played one of the best T20 knocks and made the team the first-ever MLC champions.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at the MINY squad for the 2024 season and try to figure out their strengths and weaknesses ahead of the season.\n\nHere is a look at the MI New York squad for MLC 2024.\n\nBatters: Tim David, Monank Patel, Nicholas Pooran, Heath Richards, Shayan Jahangir, Steven Taylor\n\nAll-rounders: Dewald Brevis, Ruben Clinton, Kieron Pollard, Rashid Khan, Romario Shepherd\n\nBowlers: Trent Boult, Ehsan Ali, Noshthush Kenjige, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Rushil Ugarkar\n\nStrengths of MI New York for MLC 2024\n\nBrilliant Pace Unit\n\nTrent Boult will be leading the pace attack of MI New York [X]\n\nTrent Boult, Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje will be in charge of the pace department for MI New York in this edition. These three functioning together can be lethal against any batting line-up in the tournament. Alongside the three genuine pacers, MI have Romario Shepherd, who could play a supporting role and also contribute with the bat for the team.\n\nBalanced Spin Department\n\nWhile having a very potent and fear-striking pace attack, the MI New York team can also boast of a balanced spin department. Rashid Khan will be their prime spinner, and there are no questions about his skills and what he brings to the table in this format. Nosthush Kenjige will be aiding Rashid, and we have seen in the recently concluded World Cup that Kenjige can be a very efficient bowler in the middle overs. Alongside a powerful pace attack, the spin department also looks adequate to make run-scoring for the opposition batters a problem.\n\nPowerful middle-order\n\nMI New York will have Nicholas Pooran, Dewald Brevis, Kieron Pollard, and Tim David in the middle order. These four batters should be enough to strike fear in the minds of the opposition bowlers. These batters have the ability to decimate the opposition with power-hitting and change the complexion of a match at any stage. Besides these four, MINY also has Monank Patel, Rashid Khan, and Romario Shepherd, players who can be used around that powerhouse in the game's situation and the playing conditions.\n\nWeaknesses of MI New York for MLC 2024\n\nShayan Jahangir, Monank Patel and Steven Taylor will be the players MI New York will be looking to use as their openers in the tournament. While Shayan Jahangir and Monank Patel are stable batters, sometimes their scoring rate can be an issue for the team. On the other hand, Steven Taylor, who is a power hitter at the top, suffers from a bit of inconsistency. So, the MI team in MLC will depend a lot on their fire power in the middle in order to see them through most of the games.\n\nMI New York Predicted XI for the first match"
