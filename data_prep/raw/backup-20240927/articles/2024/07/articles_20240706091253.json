        "title": "America’s Major League Cricket Set To Ride Momentum Of T20 World Cup",
        "date": "Fri Jul  5 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "After a momentous T20 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., marked by a $30 million cricket stadium in New York along with a stirring underdog performance by the national team, hopes are high for a pivotal second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nWhile this year's marquee cricket tournament was expectantly mostly in the shadows in the world's biggest sports market, it did receive significant exposure with coverage in media institutions like The New York Times, CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nNo one thinks it will become mainstream in the U.S. but the sleeping giant - with cricket by some metrics the second most popular sport in the world - has finally awakened.\n\nIt came just before the much-anticipated second season of MLC, the lucrative professional T20 league in the U.S. luring top players around the world. MI New York and Seattle Orcas launched the latest edition on Friday in a rematch of last year's final.\n\nAs I reported, the MLC's historic first season exceeded financial targets with revenues of $8 million, but its launch was undoubtedly helped by the novelty factor after previous attempts by administrators to strike gold in America failed.\n\nForbesAmerica's Major League Cricket Debut Surpassed Expectations On And Off The Field\n\n\"Could have been some element of that (novelty factor), but I think this fanbase is looking for high quality cricket on the field,\" MLC chief executive Vijay Srinivasan told me.\n\n\"We want to make sure of the standards befitting American professional sports and I think we delivered that (last season) and were recognized in the world of cricket.\"\n\nMLC has been able to secure major sponsorship deals, highlighted by Cognizant - a multinational information technology services and consulting company - becoming its first title sponsor.\n\n\"We are growing. We definitely have been very successful in sponsorship sales and certainly we want to deliver and show value,\" Srinivasan said.\n\nAs I reported previously, salary caps for teams are to remain the same, but top players will still be handsomely remunerated and earn around $175,000 for a minimum of five games - rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nWhile Indian players are not allowed to play outside of the IPL, a slew of stars will play in this season's MLC - many from Australia highlighted by San Francisco's marquee signing of Pat Cummins to a four-year deal.\n\nAhead of this season, MLC received official T20 league status with tournament playing records counted towards format statistics.\n\n\"The goal is to be competitive (financially) with the top leagues and there will be adjustment that happens as we grow,\" Srinivasan said. \"That's (salary caps) something we'll have to review every season.\n\n\"We've got some really strong names coming here. Ultimately, the teams and the players are what defines the product.\"\n\nWhile things are looking rosy in American cricket, there has been familiar warring behind the scenes with governing body USA Cricket amid continual turmoil after a spate of resignations and chief executive Dr. Noor Murad having his contract terminated earlier this year.\n\nAs I reported in April, USA Cricket avoided calls for suspension, but its funding is being 'controlled' by the sport's governing body. The situation is likely to be a talking point at the International Cricket Council's upcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\nForbes'Controlled Funding' Put In Place For USA Cricket Ahead Of Home T20 World Cup\n\nUSA Cricket sanctions MLC, which is administered by American Cricket Enterprises after signing a 50-year commercial rights agreement in 2019.\n\n\"Governance is always a challenge, but it needs to sort itself out,\" Srinivasan, a co-founder of ACE, said. \"We are certainly hopeful that things will stabilize.\"\n\nThere are plans to expand MLC, with Chicago and Atlanta touted as possible new franchises amid a longer tournament earmarked to be played over much of June and July moving forward.\n\nBut, right now, MLC is hoping to continue the trajectory of the British bat and ball sport with deep roots in a cricket backwater. While figures have varied, with the sport's governing body having claimed that there are 50 million cricket fans in the U.S., there is already an invested fanbase for MLC.\n\n\"Willow (cricket broadcaster into North America) goes into around four-five million homes, so that probably translates to a fanbase of something in the range of 10 million people,\" Srinivasan said.\n\n\"There's a lot of interest and excitement in MLC after the T20 World Cup. I think we can ride that momentum.\""

        "date": "Sat Jul  6 13:03:12 2024",
        "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 season commenced on Friday as MI New York began their title defence with a commanding six-wicket win over Seattle Orcas at the Church Street Park Stadium. All eyes were on Nicholas Pooran at Church Street Park in Morrisville as the West Indian wicketkeeper-batter continued his form from the 2023 edition. His unbeaten 62 off just 37 balls helped MI New York chase down a total of 109 runs in just 14.2 overs.\n\nWith the early wickets of Ruben Clinton (6) and USA's national team skipper Monank Patel (8), the initial momentum seemed to be in the Seattle Orcas' favour. Cameron Gannon was the main bowling aggressor, getting both batters in the third over and giving his team a ray of hope.\n\nBut then, Pooran proceeded to hit Gannon for two sixes and as many fours in his next over. This turned the tide in MI New York's favour.\n\nEventually, Pooran's power-hitting abilities proved to be too much for the Seattle Orcas. They got the wickets of Shayan Jahangir (3) and Tim David (12) as well, but the left-handed Pooran and his countryman Kieron Pollard (8*) took their team over the line for their first win of MLC 2024.\n\nEarlier in the day, the skills of the MI New York bowlers were on display as they bowled out the Seattle Orcas for just 108 runs. Rashid Khan and Trent Boult bagged three wickets each, never really allowing their opponents to settle into the match.\n\nNew Zealand's star pacer Boult got the early breakthrough in the opening over itself, sending Nauman Anwar back to the pavilion for a duck. The Pakistan batter's late attempt to cut the ball away caught a faint edge which travelled to the wicketkeeper and eventual match-winner Pooran.\n\nWith Quinton de Kock (5) still at the crease, the Seattle Orcas could still hit a competitive score, but he was also removed by Boult in the next over. His attempt to hit the ball through the leg side was met with a top edge, and Pooran did well to get underneath it and send de Kock back to the pavilion.\n\nFrom then on, MI New York were in the driving seat, getting the regular wickets. For the Seattle Orcas, Shubham Ranjane ended as the highest run-getter with a tidy innings of 35 runs in 31 balls. Finding the boundary regularly, Ranjane proved to be a threat before he tried to hit Rashid Khan for consecutive sixes but fell short in his second attempt, hitting the ball to Tim David instead.\n\nHarmeet Singh, who recently featured for the USA in the T20 World Cup, played a 20-run cameo as the side set a target that was eventually chased down by the defending champions with 34 balls to spare.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

They have a seriously strong side all-round with the likes of Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen, Rachin Ravindra, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andries Gous and Lockie Ferguson in their squad.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWW\n\nMI NEW YORK FORM: WINNING MACHINE\n\nMI New York cruised to an opening game victory against the team that they defeated in the final, the Seattle Orcas, after they skittled the Orcas for 108 in 19.1 overs yesterday. They gave teams a head start after a poor beginning to the 2023 campaign before clicking and they appear to have clicked almost immediately this time around.\n\nLAST THREE: WWWL\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Washington Freedom have an excellent side throughout but the one man, of the many, that they will rely upon for quick runs at the top of the order will be the ever impressive and still improving Travis Head. Backing the Aussie T20 opener and potential future captain to be their best bat in this one looks a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, MI New York lost both of their openers, Ruben Clifton and Monank Patel, to the change up right arm medium bowling of Cameron Gannon. That will leave Andrew Tye licking his lips and Tye to take two or more wickets is something worth having a look at here.\n\nMI NEW YORK BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nLast season, the excellence of West Indian Nicholas Pooran saw him become the tournament’s top run scorer and he got off to another strong start the other night in what proved to be a match-winning knock in a small chase. Backing Pooran to continue his fine form is always fairly safe and him scoring 30 or more seems a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, MI New York ripped through the Orcas’ top order in the powerplay with the excellent Trent Boult taking 3-25 in the end off his four overs. Rashid Khan’s spin also claimed three wickets and that is a known weakness of Head so Khan or Boult taking two or more wickets appears a more than reasonable bet.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS MI NEW YORK EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nNow then, this one might actually be tough to call. Whilst MI New York began with a comfortable victory in their opening game and they are the defending champions of this competition, the Washington Freedom have real star names of the T20 circuit littered throughout their side and will be captained by an excellent tactician in Steve Smith. One bet that seems a decent shout, though, is for Pooran to continue his good form and even top sore in the match, once again."

Captained by Corey Anderson, there is plenty of experience in the Unicorns’ side such as Pat Cummins, Matt Henry and Liam Plunkett but the star attraction is likely to be West Indian all-rounder Sherfane Rutherford.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: A TERRIBLE FIRST SEASON\n\nIn contrast to the Unicorns’ narrow miss on the top four last season, the Los Angeles Knight Riders, affiliated with Indian Premier League side the Kolkata Knight Riders, endured a miserable campaign last season. LAKR began with four defeats, and all four defeats were fairly heavy, before finishing the season, in last place, with a slender two-wicket defeat against league winners Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLLL\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe biggest weakness in a weak LAKR side would be their bowling department so San Francisco Unicorns to score big runs would appear quite likely. There aren’t too many standout candidates for that role, though, with emphasis on their own bowling but one man who will be key to any success is likely to be Jake Fraser-McGurk, set to be a leading light of Australia’s next white-ball era. Fraser-McGurk to start his newest franchise journey off well as their top scorer in this match would be worth a shot.\n\nIn the bowling attack, T20 has arguably been Pat Cummins’ weakest format but the Australian Test captain took hat-tricks in successive matches at the World Cup so will come into this feeling a bit of form. Cummins to begin his campaign with two or more wickets seems a good bet.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nAs mentioned, LAKR’s weakness is probably with the ball but with the bat they are not too much stronger, at least on paper. Former England international Jason Roy is likely to be in the top three but it will be middle-order hitting they rely on and, in particular, David Miller who is likeliest to be their best batter in most matches.\n\nWith the ball, though, they will believe that some skilful bowling will be able to hurt what is not the most star-studded Unicorns lineup. That is where the excellent spin of Adam Zampa comes into play and the Australian international to take two or more wickets seems a good bet.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS VS LOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThese two were the weakest teams in the competition last season but both sides will be hoping to be a little rejuvenated this time around. There is one clear ‘top tip’ to offer here, though. The Unicorns’ strength is in their pace-bowling attack, whilst LAKR look quite weak at the top of the order. Naturally, then, if the Unicorns open up with seam, LAKR may well struggle and that should result in the San Francisco Unicorns having the better of the powerplay and the higher opening stand."

        "body": "The teams, the format, the big names, and everything else you might have been wondering about\n\nAbhimanyu Bose\n\n05-Jul-2024 • 20 hrs ago\n\nDid you think the cricket fever would die in the USA after the T20 World Cup? Think again, because the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) is upon us. The first edition had high scores and thrilling individual performances as some of the biggest names in T20 cricket showcased their talent in Texas and North Carolina. So what's in store for us this year? Find all your answers here.\n\nFirst things first. When does it start?\n\nThe first match is on Friday, July 5, with MI New York taking on Seattle Orcas in Morrisville. The tournament will go on till July 28. There will be a total of 25 matches.\n\nSo who are the teams participating? And who won it the first time around?\n\nThe six teams are Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom.\n\nIt was MI New York, inspired by a whirlwind Nicholas Pooran century, who beat Seattle Orcas in the final to win the inaugural title.\n\nAre you sure it's the MLC and not the IPL? There seem to be a lot of familiar names...\n\nThat's because IPL franchises have invested in most of the teams in the tournament, as they have in other franchise leagues like SA20, ILT20 and the CPL. IPL franchises own four teams in the MLC. Apart from the three obvious ones, Seattle Orcas are owned by the GMR Group, who co-own Delhi Capitals.\n\nWashington Freedom, owned by Indian-American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil, have Cricket New South Wales as their high-performance partner. San Francisco Unicorns, owned by Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, have a partnership with Cricket Victoria.\n\nWe saw games in New York and Lauderhill in the T20 World Cup, apart from Dallas. Will the MLC also be played in those grounds?\n\nNo. This year's MLC, like in 2023, will only be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina's Morrisville.\n\nLast season, the first eight league games were played in Dallas and the next seven in Morrisville, before the tournament shifted back to Dallas for the knockout rounds. This year, however, both stadiums will host games throughout the season.\n\nSo you said Pooran played the last season. Who are some other big names that were there last season and will play this year as well?\n\nA total of 23 overseas players who turned out in the inaugural season will be in action in MLC 2024 as well. Among them, some of the big names include Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Heinrich Klaasen and Kieron Pollard.\n\nAfghanistan's left-arm wristspinner Noor Ahmad will replace Daryl Mitchell - who has been ruled out by an injury and is currently doing rehab in New Zealand - for Texas Super Kings. You can find the full list of retained overseas players here.\n\nAnd any exciting new additions this year?\n\nYes indeed. Pat Cummins, Travis Head and Steven Smith are some high-profile Australian signings, while Daryl Mitchell, Shakib Al Hasan and Romario Shepherd are some of the other new signings. You can see the full squads here.\n\nUSA pulled off a surprise and made it to the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup. So who will their local heroes line up for?\n\nUSA did have an impressive showing at the T20 World Cup, with a Super Over win over Pakistan the highlight. Their captain Monank Patel, Noshthush Kenjige and Shayan Jahangir will be representing defending champions MI New York, while last year's runners-up Seattle Orcas have USA vice-captain Aaron Jones and Harmeet Singh in their ranks.\n\nMilind Kumar, who took a blinder against Pakistan as a substitute fielder, will play for Texas Super Kings, while Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar will play for Washington Freedom.\n\nAll this sounds good. So, what is the format of the league?\n\nLike most franchise leagues, the MLC will first have a round-robin league stage. Last year, each team played the other once, but this time every team will play seven matches each in the league stage. This has contributed to the tournament growing from 19 games last year to 25 this season.\n\nThe top two teams will meet in the Qualifier, with the winners of that match advancing to the final.\n\nThe third and fourth-placed teams will meet in the Eliminator. The winner of the Eliminator will face the team that loses the Qualifier in the Challenger, where the second finalist will be decided.\n\nYou can see the full fixture list here.\n\nBut the MLC games don't count as official T20s, right?\n\nThat was the case last year, but the tournament has been given List A status by the ICC. It has become the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire List A status from the ICC, following the UAE's ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThis means MLC will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics.\n\nAnd with the packed cricket schedule, is it not clashing with any of the several other T20 leagues around the world?\n\nThe Lanka Premier League is on till July 21, so Matheesha Pathirana will remain unavailable till Colombo Strikers are knocked out.\n\nThere will also be a six-day clash with the Hundred , which means that 12 players who are part of the MLC could arrive late at the UK.\n\nAbhimanyu Bose is a sub-editor with ESPNcricinfo"

Just like the first season, all 25 matches will be shared between Morrisville and Dallas. The playoffs and the final will be played in Dallas. You can check out the full schedule here\n\nWhat is the format of the tournament?\n\nTeams will play each other twice in the group stage, and the top four sides will progress to the playoffs. The No. 1 and 2 placed sides will face each other in the Qualifier, and the winner of that game will make it through to the final. The Eliminator will feature the third-placed team taking on the fourth, with the winner progressing to the Challenger, where they will face the losing team from the Qualifier.\n\nThe winner of the Challenger will then take on the winner of the Qualifier in the final.\n\nWho won the previous edition?\n\nMI New York rode on a superb 137* (55) by their stand-in skipper Nicholas Pooran to beat Seattle Orcas by seven wickets in the final to lift the trophy at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas.\n\nWho are the captains and coaches of teams in MLC 2024?\n\nA couple of changes from last year. Corey Anderson will lead San Francisco Unicorns, taking over from the retired Aaron Finch. Steven Smith has been named the captain of Washington Freedom, with Moises Henriques making way. Head coaches have also been rejigged, with Ricky Ponting taking over as the Washington head coach.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) – Captain: Sunil Narine, Head coach: Phil Simmons\n\nMI New York (MINY) – Captain: Kieron Pollard, Head coach: Robin Peterson\n\nSan Fransisco Unicorns (SFU) – Captain: Corey Anderson, Head coach: Shane Watson\n\nSeattle Orcas (SO) – Captain: Wayne Parnell, Head coach: Pravin Amre\n\nTexas Super Kings (TSK) – Captain: Faf du Plessis, Head coach: Stephen Fleming\n\nWashington Freedom (WF) – Captain: Steven Smith, Head coach: Ricky Ponting\n\nHow many players can each team have?\n\nAll teams need a minimum of 16 players, but the number cannot exceed 19. No team can have more than nine overseas players.\n\nWho are the overseas players retained from the previous edition?\n\nLos Angeles: Spencer Johnson, Sunil Narine, Jason Roy, Andre Russell, Adam Zampa\n\nNew York: Trent Boult, Dewald Brevis, Tim David, Rashid Khan, Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard, Kagiso Rabada\n\nSan Francisco: Finn Allen, Haris Rauf\n\nSeattle: Heinrich Klaasen, Quinton de Kock, Wayne Parnell, Imad Wasim\n\nTexas: Devon Conway, Faf du Plessis, Mitchell Santner\n\nWashington: Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen\n\nTell me a bit about the local players – who among US’ T20 World Cup squad will feature in the tournament?\n\nThirteen of the US’ 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup 2024 will take part in MLC 2024.

On May 28, the ICC granted MLC a List A status, which implies that all the matches played in the tournament will be counted as official T20s, unlike the first season. MLC is only the second T20 league hosted by an associate to get this honour after UAE’s International T20 (ILT20).\n\nWhere can I watch MLC in India?\n\nIndian viewers can watch every ball on Jio Cinema. Unfortunately, the tournament will not be telecast on any TV channel."

        "body": "Cognizant Major League Cricket Game 1 Highlights, Seattle Orcas vs. MI New York\n\n© MLC Network\n\nThe 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket season kicked off on Friday with MI New York starting their defense in impressive fashion, securing a commanding six-wicket victory over the Seattle Orcas.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nMI New York 111/4 (14.2 ov) MI New York 111/4 (14.2 ov)\n\nSeattle Orcas 108/10 (19.1 ov)\n\nMI New York won by 6 wickets Seattle Orcas 108/10 (19.1 ov)\n\nMI New York won by 6 wickets\n\nSCORECARD\n\nAll eyes were on Nicholas Pooran at Church Street Park in Morrisville as the West Indian wicketkeeper-batter continued his form from the 2023 edition. His unbeaten 62 off just 37 balls helped MI New York chase down the total of 109 runs in just 14.2 overs.\n\nWith the early wickets of Ruben Clinton (6) and USA’s national team skipper Monank Patel (8), the initial momentum seemed to be in the Seattle Orcas’ favour. Cameron Gannon was the main bowling aggressor, getting both batters in the third over and giving his team a ray of hope.\n\nBut then, Pooran proceeded to hit Gannon for 2 sixes and as many fours in his next over. This turned the tide in MI New York’s favour.\n\nEventually, Pooran’s power-hitting abilities proved to be too much for the Seattle Orcas. They got the wickets of Shayan Jahangir (3) and Tim David (12) as well, but the left-handed Pooran and his countryman Kieron Pollard (8*) took their team over the line for their first win of MLC 2024.\n\nEarlier in the day, the skills of the MI New York bowlers were on display as they bowled out the Seattle Orcas for just 108 runs. Rashid Khan and Trent Boult bagged three wickets each, never really allowing their opponents to settle into the match.\n\nNew Zealand’s star pacer Boult got the early breakthrough in the opening over itself, sending Nauman Anwar back to the pavilion for a duck. The Pakistan batter’s late attempt to cut the ball away caught a faint edge which travelled to the wicketkeeper and eventual match-winner Nicholas Pooran.\n\nWith Quinton de Kock (5) still in the crease, the Seattle Orcas could hit a competitive score, but he was also gone in Boult’s next over. His attempt to hit the ball through the leg side was met with a top edge, and Pooran did well to get underneath it and send de Kock back to the pavilion.\n\nFrom then on, MI New York were in the driving seat, getting the regular wickets. For the Seattle Orcas, Shubham Ranjane ended as the highest run-getter with a tidy innings of 35 runs in 31 balls. Finding the boundary regularly, Ranjane proved to be a threat before he tried to hit Rashid Khan for consecutive sixes but fell short in his second attempt, hitting the ball to Tim David instead.\n\nHarmeet Singh, who recently featured for the USA in the T20 World Cup, played a 20-run cameo as the side set a target that was eventually chased down by the defending champions with 34 balls to spare.\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-1 (Nauman Anwar - 0.6 ov), 2-8 (Quinton de Kock - 2.6 ov), 3-19 (Aaron Jones - 5.4 ov), 4-31 (Heinrich Klaasen - 7.3 ov), 5-53 (Imad Wasim - 11.2 ov), 6-58 (Michael Bracewell - 12.2 ov), 7-83 (Shubham Ranjane - 15.2 ov), 8-93 (Harmeet Singh - 16.2 ov), 9-99 (Cameron Gannon - 17.2 ov), 10-108 (Nandre Burger - 19.1 ov)\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-12 (Ruben Clinton - 2.3 ov), 2-16 (Monank Patel - 2.6 ov), 3-57 (Shayan Jahangir - 6.5 ov), 4-83 (Tim David - 11.3 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nMI New York\n\nSteven Taylor\n\nMonank Patel\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nShayan Jahangir\n\nTim David\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nRashid Khan\n\nRuben Clinton\n\nEhsan Adil\n\nTrent Boult\n\nAnrich Nortje\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nAaron Jones\n\nNauman Anwar\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nMichael Bracewell\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nImad Wasim\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nNandre Burger\n\nZaman Khan\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Friday, July 5, 2024 20:30\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville"

Ali Khan then delivered a match-winning performance, taking four wickets for 33 runs, to restrict the Texas Super Kings to 150/8, clinching the win by 12 runs.\n\nOn what turned out to be a challenging batting wicket, the Texas Super Kings began their chase of 163 runs cautiously. Skipper Faf du Plessis (14 off 14), who attempted to accelerate the run rate, was dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the fifth over. Trying his signature scoop, he mistimed the shot and was caught by Derone Davis at mid-wicket. Aaron Hardie (11 off 14) was then sent packing by Shakib Al Hasan in the ninth over.\n\nOpener Devon Conway kept the scoreboard ticking, steadily taking the Super Kings closer to the target with timely boundaries. However, Ali Khan turned things around for the LA Knight Riders by taking three wickets in the 14th over. He bowled Conway, hitting the off-stump, then dismissed Joshua Tromp (18 off 14), who was by Derone Davis with a stunning catch, as the ball was flying off the edge to third man. The subsequent delivery saw Milind Kumar (0 off 1) caught at slip by Andre Russell. Marcus Stoinis (2 off 6) fell in the following over, scoring just two off six balls, leaving the Super Kings reeling from 100/2 to 107/6 after 15 overs.\n\nHowever, Calvin Savage took matters into his hands and kept the Super Kings in the game with a flurry of boundaries and sixes. He along with Naveen-ul-Haq smashed 17 runs off Ali Khan in the 18th over to take the equation down to 27 runs from 12 balls. Russell and Khan then bowled exceptional final two overs to close out the game for LA Knight Riders.\n\nEarlier in the contest, Texas Super Kings won the toss and opted to bowl first. Zia-ul-Haq shook the LA Knight Riders' lineup, dismissing both openers, Jason Roy (2 off 11) and Sunil Narine (2 off 3), in the third over, leaving the Knight Riders struggling at 10/2 after three overs.\n\nUnmukt Chand and Shakib Al Hasan attempted to steady the innings, but the latter fell to Aaron Hardie in the seventh over, having scored 18 off 13 balls. Nitish Kumar then added 26 runs off 17 deliveries before being dismissed in the 11th over, with the score at 78/4.\n\nDespite the rapid fall of wickets, including those of impactful players like David Miller (4 off 9) and Andre Russell (10 off 5), Chand kept one end intact. He played a magnificent knock of 68 runs from 45 balls, laced with six boundaries and three sixes, to anchor the Knight Riders' innings. He got out in the last over, but Corne Dry's onslaught of three fours off Marcus Stoinis powered the LA Knight Riders to a respectable total of 162/7 in 20 overs\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Stats\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Fall of wickets: 1-4 (Jason Roy - 2.1 ov), 2-5 (Sunil Narine - 2.5 ov), 3-44 (Shakib Al Hasan - 6.4 ov), 4-78 (Nitish Kumar - 10.3 ov), 5-95 (David Miller - 13.2 ov), 6-106 (Andre Russell - 14.2 ov), 7-150 (Unmukt Chand - 19.2 ov)\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-30 (Faf du Plessis - 4.3 ov), 2-64 (Aaron Hardie - 8.5 ov), 3-102 (Devon Conway - 13.2 ov), 4-103 (Joshua Tromp - 13.5 ov), 5-103 (Milind Kumar - 13.6 ov), 6-107 (Marcus Stoinis - 14.6 ov), 7-115 (Gerald Coetzee - 16.4 ov), 8-120 (Mohammad Mohsin - 17.2 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nNaveen ul Haq\n\nGerald Coetzee\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nUnmukt Chand(WK)\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nJason Roy\n\nDavid Miller\n\nAndre Russell\n\nSunil Narine(C)\n\nShakib Al Hasan\n\nAli Khan\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nDerone Davis\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Saturday, July 6, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: Texas Super Kings elected to bowl"

        "body": "The Major League Cricket 2024 season commenced on Friday with MI New York beginning their title defense with a commanding six-wicket win over the Seattle Orcas. All eyes were on Nicholas Pooran at Church Street Park in Morrisville as the West Indian wicketkeeper-batter continued his form from the 2023 edition. His unbeaten 62 off just 37 balls helped MI New York chase down 109 in just 14.2 overs. With the early wickets of Ruben Clinton (6) and USA’s national team skipper Monank Patel (8), the initial momentum seemed to be in the Seattle Orcas’ favor. Cameron Gannon was the main bowling aggressor, dismissing both batters in the third over and giving his team a ray of hope.\n\nBut then, Pooran proceeded to hit Gannon for two sixes and as many fours in his next over, turning the tide in MI New York’s favor. Eventually, Pooran’s power-hitting abilities proved to be too much for the Seattle Orcas. They got the wickets of Shayan Jahangir (3) and Tim David (12) as well, but the left-handed Pooran and his countryman Kieron Pollard (8*) took their team over the line for their first win of MLC 2024. Earlier in the day, the skills of the MI New York bowlers were on display as they bowled out the Seattle Orcas for just 108 runs. Rashid Khan and Trent Boult bagged three wickets each, never really allowing their opponents to settle into the match.\n\nNew Zealand’s star pacer Boult got the early breakthrough in the opening over itself, sending Nauman Anwar back to the pavilion for a duck. The Pakistan batter’s late attempt to cut the ball away caught a faint edge which traveled to the wicketkeeper and eventual match-winner, Nicholas Pooran. With Quinton de Kock (5) still in the crease, the Seattle Orcas could still hit a competitive score, but he was also gone in Boult’s next over. His attempt to hit the ball through the leg side was met with a top edge, and Pooran did well to get underneath it and send de Kock back to the pavilion.\n\nFrom then on, MI New York were in the driving seat, getting regular wickets. For the Seattle Orcas, Shubham Ranjane ended as the highest run-getter with a tidy innings of 35 runs in 31 balls. Finding the boundary regularly, Ranjane proved to be a threat before he tried to hit Rashid Khan for consecutive sixes but fell short in his second attempt, hitting the ball to Tim David instead. Harmeet Singh, who recently featured for the USA in the T20 World Cup, played a 20-run cameo as the side set a target that was eventually chased down by the defending champions with 34 balls to spare.\n\nUNMUKT CHAND STARS FOR LA KNIGHT RIDERS\n\nIn the second match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket, Los Angeles Knight Riders put up a brilliant show to take down the Texas Super Kings by 12 runs at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, on the opening night of the season. Unmukt Chand's brilliant 68 off 45 balls powered the LA Knight Riders to a total of 162/7 in their allotted 20 overs. Ali Khan then delivered a match-winning performance, taking four wickets for 33 runs, to restrict the Texas Super Kings to 150/8, clinching the win by 12 runs.\n\nOn what turned out to be a challenging batting wicket, the Texas Super Kings began their chase of 163 runs cautiously.

In 7 matches, he accumulated 143 runs at a strike rate of 126.54 with the best score of 61.\n\nTop Pick – All-Rounder\n\nDwayne Bravo played his role exceptionally well for Texas Super Kings in the first season. His stint was minimal however made a huge impact, scoring 136 runs at a strike rate of 154.54 and picking up 3 wickets at an economy of 7.45.\n\nTop Pick – Bowler\n\nNaveen ul Haq had an impressive T20 World Cup 2024 for Afghanistan where he finished with 13 scalps in 8 matches with the best figures of 4 for 26.\n\nTop Pick – Wicketkeeper\n\nDevon Conway will don the gloves behind the stumps for Texas Super Kings.

Devon Conway (vc), David Miller, Faf du Plesses, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Sunil Narine (c), Andre Russell, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Santner, Naveen ul Haq, Spencer Johnson, Mohammad Mohsin\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nTexas Super Kings enjoyed a great run in the league stages of the inaugural edition, winning 4 of their 5 matches until their downfall came in playoffs where they lost back-to-back matches to get eliminated. The overseas retention list includes only Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, and skipper Faf du Plessis. They signed some of the big names for the forthcoming season including the likes of Aiden Markram, Dwayne Bravo, Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Hardie, Gerald Coetzee, Naveen ul Haq, and Noor Ahmad (replacement for injured Daryl Mitchell).\n\nMatheesha Pathirana who is currently involved in Lanka Premier League is expected to join the squad later in the tournament. Saiteja Mukkamalla, Milind Kumar, Mohammad Mohsin, Cameron Stevenson, Zia Shahzad, Calvin Salvage, and Zia ul Haq are the 7 local players retained by the franchise. With only six overseas players allowed to feature in the playing eleven, it’s a hectic task for skipper Faf du Plessis and head coach Stephen Fleming to field the best possible eleven.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders didn’t meet the expectations in the first edition of the Major League Cricket as they finished last in the standings, claiming only two points. They didn’t recover from the poor batting display at the start where they bowled out for 112 and 50 against Super Kings and MI New York respectively.\n\nThey retained four players from the previous season namely Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Spencer Johnson, and skipper Sunil Narine. Knight Riders roped in some big names across the globe including Shakib Al Hasan, Josh Little, David Miller, Alex Carey, and Waqar Salamkheil. The local retention list features Unmukt Chand, Nitish Kumar, Saif Badar, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Corne Dry, and Ali Khan."

It is a high-scoring venue, and one can see a score of around 170-180 with the fast outfield.\n\nTEX vs LAS: Predicted XIs:\n\nTexas Super Kings: Devon Conway, Faf du Plessis (c), Aiden Markram (vc), Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Hardie, DJ Bravo, Mitchell Santner, Naveen-ul-Haq, Noor Ahmad, Gerald Coetzee, Matheesha Pathirana\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Sunil Narine (vc), Jason Roy, David Miller, Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell (c), Nitish Kumar, Alex Carey (wk), Adithya Ganesh, Josh Little, Spencher Johnson, Ali Khan\n\nSuggested Dream11 Fantasy Team No. 1 TEX vs LAS Dream11:\n\nWicket-keeper: Devon Conway\n\nBatter: Faf du Plessis, Jason Roy, Aiden Markram\n\nAll-rounders: Shakib Al Hasan, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Marcus Stoinis\n\nBowlers: Ali Khan, Naveen ul Haq, Spencer Johnson\n\nCaptain First-Choice: Sunil Narine || Captain Second-Choice: Devon Conway\n\nVice-captain First-Choice: Marcus Stoinis || Vice-captain Second-Choice: Jason Roy\n\nSuggested Dream11 Fantasy Team No. 2 TEX vs LAS Dream11:\n\nWicket-keeper: Devon Conway\n\nBatter: Faf du Plessis, Jason Roy\n\nAll-rounders: Shakib Al Hasan, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Hardie, DJ Bravo\n\nBowlers: Naveen ul Haq, Gerald Coetzee\n\nCaptain First-Choice: Andre Russell || Captain Second-Choice: Shakib Al Hasan\n\nVice-captain First-Choice: Aaron Hardie || Vice-captain Second-Choice: Jason Roy\n\nTEX vs LAS: Dream11 Prediction – Who Will Win?\n\nBoth teams have a number of proven match-winners on their side.

Their brilliant run faced a roadblock as they suffered a defeat in the Qualifier 2 against MI New York.\n\nOn the other hand, the Sunil Narine-led team had a disappointing campaign in the last edition.

        "body": "by Smit Patel • Last updated on\n\nMI New York were the inaugural champions © MLC\n\nCricket in America again?\n\nYes. The new kid on the block in world cricket is back again albeit for a private bash this time. Major League Cricket (MLC) is returning for its second season, kicking off with a finale rematch from the inaugural season between MI New York and Seattle Orcas on July 5 at 2pm local time in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nErrm, I am new to this MLC thing. American cricket only caught my attention after the World Cup. Who are the teams? How long will the tournament last?\n\nMLC is currently a six-team tournament with an intention to grow into 10. The IPL teams like going global and they did not need an invite to invest in the biggest sports media market in the world. MI New York, Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders are the American offshoots of the respective IPL franchises. GMR, the part owners of Delhi Capitals also own some stake in the Seattle Orcas, co-owned by a consortium led by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. The Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns are owned by tech tycoon Sanjay Govil and a consortium led by Venky Harinarayan and Anand Rajaraman, founders of Junglee respectively. The MLC is a $120m startup with added investments of other Silicon Valley bigwigs.\n\nSeason 1 was a single round-robin followed by the knockouts. Season 2 will see 7 league games followed by the knockouts with the final on July 28 with games in Morrisville and Dallas.\n\nWho all are playing? The tournament starts within a week's time of the World Cup final in Barbados. Surely, your A-list stars are putting their feet up somewhere after a gruelling IPL and world cup odyssey.\n\nWho doesn't like coming to America for a quick round of bat and ball and endless amounts of golf! That's right, some of them hit more golf balls than cricket balls last year with a myriad of spectacular golf courses to choose from. And this is what Pat Cummins had to say after his signing with the Unicorns: \"While cricket is integral to my involvement, the global network and long-term possibilities offered by the owners specifically, and Silicon Valley more broadly presented a unique opportunity for me and my life beyond cricket.\"\n\nSeven members from the Australian T20 World Cup team headed stateside including Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, Tim David and Marcus Stoinis. World cricket's newest sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk will turn up to live up to his hype in the IPL. Some of the South African World Cup contingent namely David Miller, Kagiso Rabada, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen and Anrich Nortje too will scamper to America after Hurricane Beryl disrupted travel schedules. Nicholas Pooran, Sunil Narine and Andre Russel will bring the Caribbean flavour. Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson represent the cream of Kiwi talent in the competition.\n\nWhat about the locals? Is Saurabh Netravalkar playing? Does he have enough leaves now?\n\nFortunately he does. And he will be back on the park for Washington Freedom. USA captain Monank Patel has recuperated from his dreaded shoulder injury and will turn out for MI New York. Steven Taylor, Nosthush Kenjige and Shayan Jahangir are the other USA players on MINY roster. Unmukt Chand was seen refining his wicketkeeping skills and will be buzzing to prove a point after his World Cup snub. Chand has been retained by LAKR along with Nitish Kumar and Ali Khan.\n\nHow's the crowd buzz with no Indian players in the offing?\n\nLast year, Texas Super Kings played all of home night games in front of packed crowds and so did teams like LAKR and MINY. Super Kings fan made a spectacle out of any home game and things weren't that different at the Morrisville. By the end of the season, TSK ran out of whistles and teams like MINY ran short on merchandise despite playing at away venues in Dallas and Morrisville. The league has had a soaring fanbase right from its inception, cashing in on the already established support base of the IPL franchises among cricket watchers in America.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet\n\nTAGS\n\nRELATED STORIES"

        "body": "Nicholas Pooran continued his excellent form in the shortest format, and with Trent Boult and Rashid Khan also in similar fiery moods, last year’s champions MI New York won the opening match of Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024.\n\nIn Morrisville, New York clashed with the Seattle Orcas in the first fixture of the tournament. New York skipper Kieron Pollard won the toss and opted to field first, putting the Seattle to the test. Despite their best efforts, Seattle struggled to surpass the 100-run mark, ultimately being bowled out for 108 runs in 19.1 overs.\n\nSeattle Orcas’ struggles\n\nShubham Ranjan top-scored for Seattle with 35 runs, including 2 fours and 2 sixes in his 31-ball innings. Harmeet Singh contributed 20 runs off 14 balls, hitting 2 fours and 1 six, while Aaron Jones managed 12 runs off 16 balls with 2 fours. However, the rest of the lineup faltered, with Quinton de Kock, captain Enrique Klassen, Imad Wasim and Michael Bracewell all failing to make significant contributions. New York’s bowling attack, led by Boult and Rashid, proved too formidable. Boult took 3 wickets for 25 runs in his 4 overs, while Rashid claimed 3 wickets for 22 runs. Pollard chipped in with 2 wickets for 11 runs, and Ehsan Adil and Enrique Norkia took 1 wicket each.\n\nNicholas Pooran’s match-winning knock for MI New York\n\nIn reply, New York chased down the target with ease, scoring 111 runs for 4 wickets in just 14.2 overs, securing a six wicket victory with 34 balls remaining. The highlight of the chase was Pooran’s unbeaten 62 runs off 37 balls, an innings that included 7 fours and 2 sixes. Pooran’s aggressive approach and timely boundaries kept the momentum in MI New York’s favour. Pooran was further named Player of the Match for his explosive yet calculated knock.\n\nAlso READ: Star players from IPL 2024 who will feature in the MLC 2024\n\nPooran’s brutal assault against Cameron Gannon\n\nPooran’s assault against Cameron Gannon was the defining moment of New York’s victory. With New York were at one time at a challenging 19/2 in the first four overs of the powerplay, Pooran took charge to change the course of the match. The turning point came in the fifth over, where Pooran unleashed his fury on Gannon, scoring 22 runs off the over and shifting the momentum decisively.\n\nOn the first ball of the over, Pooran played a dot ball, setting the stage for what was to come. The second delivery was slightly full and off-stump, which Pooran dispatched over wide long-on for a massive six, electrifying the crowd. This shot demonstrated his power and ability to seize scoring opportunities. Gannon’s attempt to adjust on the third ball resulted in another delivery in Pooran’s hitting zone, which he sent soaring over midwicket for another six, showcasing his aggressive intent and capacity to build pressure on the bowler.\n\nThe fourth ball saw Pooran smartly taking a double, keeping the scoreboard ticking and retaining the strike. On the fifth ball, Gannon bowled short and wide, and Pooran expertly cut it behind backward point for a four, highlighting his precision and versatility. The final delivery of the over was placed with finesse by Pooran, again behind backward point for another boundary, emphasizing his skill in finding gaps and executing shots with precision.\n\nHere’s the video:"

On the fifth delivery, Ali bowled a short ball that batter Joshua Tromp smashed towards the third man. The ball seemed destined for a boundary, flying high and fast. Davis, stationed at third man, had to act quickly. With no time to reach the ball conventionally, he threw himself into a dive.\n\nThe spectacular catch\n\nAs the ball popped out of Davis’ hands during the dive, it seemed the chance might be lost. However, displaying remarkable presence of mind and athleticism, Davis managed to grab the rebound with his right hand. Despite the challenging circumstances, he made the catch look both easy and his ability to keep his eyes on the ball while falling to the ground was nothing short of exceptional.\n\nThe crowd erupted in applause, and the video of Davis’ incredible catch quickly went viral, showcasing the high level of skill and excitement that MLC brings to the field.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso READ: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024: Broadcast, live streaming details – When and Where to watch in India, US, UK, Australia & other countries\n\nUnmukt Chand shines with the bat\n\nElecting to bowl first, the Super Kings aimed to restrict the Knight Riders to a manageable total. However, despite early setbacks with Jason Roy and Sunil Narine falling cheaply, Unmukt Chand anchored the innings brilliantly. Unmukt’s splendid knock of 68 off 45 balls, which included 6 fours and 3 sixes, provided a solid foundation for the Knight Riders.\n\nContributions from Nitish Kumar, who scored 26 off 17, and Corne Dry‘s quickfire 12 off 4 balls, helped LAKR post a competitive total of 162/7. For the Super Kings, Zia-ul-Haq and Aaron Hardie were the standout bowlers, each taking two wickets and conceding 16 and 26 runs respectively.\n\nAli Khan’s sizzling bowling take the Knight Riders home\n\nChasing 163, Texas Super Kings’ innings was led by Devon Conway, who scored a solid 53 off 39 balls. Despite Conway’s efforts and a quick 29 off 18 from Calvin Savage, the Super Kings struggled to build partnerships and lost wickets at regular intervals.\n\nThe Knight Riders’ bowlers were disciplined, with Ali being the pick of the bowlers, claiming 4 wickets for 33 runs in his 4 overs. Spencer Johnson and Narine also made significant contributions with 2 and 1 wicket respectively. Their efforts restricted Texas Super Kings to 150/8 in their 20 overs, falling short by 12 runs."
