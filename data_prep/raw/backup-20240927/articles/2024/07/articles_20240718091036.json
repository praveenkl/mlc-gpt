However, Shadley Van Schalkwyk broke the 79-run partnership by dismissing Head in the ninth over.\n\nRachin Ravindra (11) then joined Steven Smith, who began to accelerate, adding 29 runs together. However, the pace and bounce of Spencer Johnson deceived Ravindra in the 13th over, leaving the score at 109/2.

Finn Allen and Matthew Short got San Francisco Unicorns off to a flying start. They smashed 34 and 56 runs respectively and got San Francisco Unicorns in a great position in the match.

Ryan Rickelton’s (89) breathtaking 52-ball knock for the Seattle Orcas was ultimately in vain.\n\nChasing a below-par score, the Los Angeles Knight Riders orchestrated a comfortable run chase. Sunil Narine’s (8) lean run continued when Spencer Johnson dismissed him in the second over, while Jason Roy (26) and Unmukt Chand (62) went on to build an important partnership. At the end of the powerplay, the Los Angeles Knight Riders were 47/1.\n\nThe 58-run alliance between Roy and Chand was derailed by Harmeet Singh in the 10th over. Unmukt Chand went on to bring up his half-century in 38 deliveries, comprising three sixes and three fours. In the 17th over, Chand fell to Harmeet Singh, but at 120/5, the Knight Riders were in a strong position.\n\nNitish Kumar (12) and Saif Badar (18*) came together for a brief partnership before Andre Russell (10) made a quick contribution to ensure the Los Angeles Knight Riders secured victory with balls to spare. Harmeet Singh (2/27) and Cameron Gannon (2/35) were the pick of the Orcas bowling efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Seattle Orcas suffered an early setback when Shehan Jayasuriya (2) was dismissed by Corne Dry. Soon after, Quinton de Kock (0) was run out without troubling the scorers. Opener Ryan Rickelton continued his fine form and quickly accumulated runs as he was joined by Heinrich Klaasen. By the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 36/2, with Rickelton having scored 27 of those runs.\n\nIn the ninth over, Rickelton shifted into another gear, hammering Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a 22-run over. Remarkably, no other batsman besides Rickelton had scored a boundary for the Orcas in the first 10 overs. Rickelton brought up his half-century in just 28 deliveries, featuring five maximums and four boundaries. Meanwhile, Klaasen (23) played a more guarded knock, providing stability at the other end until he was unfortunately run out in the 12th over at 90/3.\n\nWhile Rickelton continued to flourish, striking another six and four fours, the lack of support around him meant the Orcas failed to build any more concrete partnerships. Aaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were castled by the experienced Sunil Narine and Andre Russell before Rickelton would eventually perish just shy of a century, dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over. The Seattle Orcas finished on 142/6 in 20 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-24 (Shehan Jayasuriya - 3.2 ov), 2-26 (Quinton de Kock - 3.6 ov), 3-90 (Heinrich Klaasen - 11.6 ov), 4-113 (Aaron Jones - 15.4 ov), 5-121 (Michael Bracewell - 17.3 ov), 6-135 (Ryan Rickelton - 18.5 ov)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Fall of wickets: 1-13 (Sunil Narine - 2.2 ov), 2-71 (Jason Roy - 9.5 ov), 3-83 (David Miller - 11.1 ov), 4-105 (Nitish Kumar - 13.5 ov), 5-120 (Unmukt Chand - 16.4 ov), 6-140 (Andre Russell - 18.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XIs\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nRyan Rickelton\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nAaron Jones\n\nMichael Bracewell\n\nKeemo Paul\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nLungi Ngidi\n\nAli Sheikh\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nJason Roy\n\nSunil Narine(C)\n\nUnmukt Chand(WK)\n\nDavid Miller\n\nAndre Russell\n\nSaif Badar\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nCorne Dry\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nAli Khan\n\nWaqar Salamkheil\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Wednesday, July 17, 2024 20:00\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville\n\nToss: Seattle Orcas elected to bat"

        "body": "Unmukt Chand's crucial 62 helps Los Angeles Knight Riders beat Seattle Orcas by four wickets in MLC match.\n\nDOCTOR VERIFIED\n\nMorrisville: A crucial half-century from Unmukt Chand (62) ensured the Los Angeles Knight Riders defeated the Seattle Orcas by four wickets and five balls to spare in the 15th match of Major League Cricket at Church Street Park, Morrisville.\n\nRyan Rickelton’s (89) breathtaking 52-ball knock for the Seattle Orcas was ultimately in vain. Chasing a below-par total of 143, the Los Angeles Knight Riders orchestrated a comfortable run chase.\n\nSunil Narine’s (8) lean run continued when Spencer Johnson dismissed him in the second over, while Jason Roy (26) and Unmukt Chand (62) went on to build an important partnership.\n\nAt the end of the powerplay, the Los Angeles Knight Riders were 47/1.\n\nThe 58-run alliance between Roy and Chand was derailed by Harmeet Singh in the 10th over. Unmukt Chand went on to bring up his half-century in 38 deliveries, comprising three sixes and three fours. In the 17th over, Chand fell to Harmeet Singh, but at 120/5, the Knight Riders were in a strong position.\n\nNitish Kumar (12) and Saif Badar (18*) came together for a brief partnership before Andre Russell (10) made a quick contribution to ensure the Los Angeles Knight Riders secured victory with balls to spare. Harmeet Singh (2/27) and Cameron Gannon (2/35) were the pick of the Orcas bowling efforts.\n\nEarlier in the match, the Seattle Orcas suffered an early setback when Shehan Jayasuriya (2) was dismissed by Corne Dry. Soon after, Quinton de Kock (0) was run out without troubling the scorers.\n\nOpener Ryan Rickelton continued his fine form and quickly accumulated runs as he was joined by Heinrich Klaasen. By the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 36/2, with Rickelton having scored 27 of those runs.\n\nIn the ninth over, Rickelton shifted into another gear, hammering Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a 22-run over. Remarkably, no other batsman besides Rickelton had scored a boundary for the Orcas in the first 10 overs.\n\nRickelton brought up his half-century in just 28 deliveries, featuring five maximums and four boundaries. Meanwhile, Klaasen (23) played a more guarded knock, providing stability at the other end until he was unfortunately run out in the 12th over at 90/3.\n\nWhile Rickelton continued to flourish, striking another six and four fours, the lack of support around him meant the Orcas failed to build any more concrete partnerships. Aaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were castled by the experienced Sunil Narine and Andre Russell before Rickelton would eventually perish just shy of a century, dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over. The Seattle Orcas finished on 142/6 in 20 overs.\n\nBrief Scores: Los Angeles Knight Riders 143/6 (Unmukt Chand 62, Jason Roy 27, Harmeet Singh 2/27, Cameron Gannon 2/25) vs Seattle Orcas 142/6 (Ryan Rickelton 82, Heinrich Klaasen 23, Corne Dry 1/8, Andre Russell 1/15)."

Rauf is currently representing the San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) in the ongoing Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024).\n\nWell, this time Sri Lankan batter Shehan Jayasuriya left Rauf stunned yet angry with his amazing shot in the 13th match of the ongoing MCL 2024 between the San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) and Seattle Orcas (SOR) at the Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns won the MLC 2024 match, but Shehan Jayasuriya's stunning shot stole the show\n\nOpening alongside Ryan Rickelton (29) for the Seattle Orcas (SOR), Jayasuriya played a brilliant knock, but his fifty was not enough, as the San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) won the MCL 2024 game by 23 runs at Church Street Park in Morrisville. It was the Seattle Orcas’ (SOR) fourth defeat in the tournament.\n\nWell, the 32-year-old left-hander smoked seven fours and two sixes during his brilliant knock of 54 runs off 37 deliveries before being dismissed by Australian captain and star pacer Pat Cummins in the MLC 2024 game.\n\nComing back to Jayasuriya’s amazing shot off Rauf, the spectators and fans got to see one of the best shots of the league in the sixth over of the Seattle Orcas’ (SOR) innings against the San Francisco Unicorns (SFU).\n\nRauf delivered a short-of-a-length ball outside the off-stump. Jayasuriya, having anticipated such a delivery, went for an unconventional stance. He executed a daring reverse scoop, timing it perfectly to send the ball effortlessly over the wicketkeeper's head for a boundary.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya's unbelievable reverse scoop stuns Haris Rauf\n\nThe Pakistan pacer, stunned by the audacity of the shot, glared at the Sri Lankan batter before turning back to his run-up. Rauf returned wicketless while conceding 30 runs from his four overs, but his San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) won the match by 23 runs to record their second win of the ongoing MCL 2024.\n\nHowever, the video of the Pakistani pacer being the victim of Jayasuriya's reverse shot was all over the internet, with fans finding it funny and not surprised by his hammering even in the new T20 league.\n\nWatch Here:\n\nCorey Anderson happy with San Francisco Unicorns' efforts against Seattle Orcas\n\nMeanwhile, San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) captain Corey Anderson said at the post-match presentation, “Pretty good result. The boys did a great job in the back end of the batting innings and then came out strong with the ball.” Praising Sanjay Krishnamurthi for his quick cameo of 30 runs off 21 balls, the skipper said: “He’s a young kid who's got so much talent. Huge pluses for him today. It was a pretty big inning in the context of the game. 30 runs in a game like this is huge.”\n\nAnderson signed off by saying, “Pat Cummins is a world-class player; just having him in the group speaking cricket calms the group. Great for the balance of the team as well. We want to try and win every game; we go back to Dallas, and we want to reassess quickly, so hopefully we can get a bit of momentum out of this one.”"

The match between the two teams took place at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina on Wednesday (17th July).\n\nThe incident took place during the 4th ball of the second over when Carmi le Roux was bowling to Ryan Rickelton. The fast bowler looked in good rhythm and bowled impeccable lines and lengths, not allowing the batters to free their arms in the chase of 166.\n\nCarmi le Roux bowled a full delivery outside off to which batter Ryan Rickelton drove it back to the bowler. The ball hit him straight in the face as it came hard. He had no chance to save himself as the ball hit him and went onto towards mid-on. The pacer was down and in a bit of pain.\n\nWith the blow that he faced, Carmi le Roux wasn't in a position to bowl. He then walked off the field and he looked in immense pain. The fast bowler then was replaced by skipper Corey Anderson, who completed the over.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nCarmi le Roux after that didn't return to the field. He bowled 1.4 overs in the game and gave away 11 runs. But his absence wasn't felt much as the San Francisco Unicorns bowlers bowled well and didn't let the Seattle Orcas batters settle. They picked wickets at regular intervals and sealed the game.\n\nLiam Plunkett was the pick of the bowlers with his figures of 3/26. Along with him, Matthew Short, Corey Anderson, and Pat Cummins picked one wicket each. They restricted the opposition to a total of 142/6 and won the game by the margin of 23 runs to get important two points under their belt.\n\nFor Seattle Orcas, Shehan Jayasuriya was the only batter who looked settled at the crease. The opening batter scored 54 runs off 37 balls. He batted with a strike rate of over 145 and also slammed 7 fours and 2 sixes. Ryan Rickelton (29) was the second-highest scorer while the rest of the batters failed to get past the 16-run mark.\n\nThe boys did a great job - San Fransico Unicorns skipper Corey Anderson\n\nSan Fransico Unicorns skipper Corey Anderson talked about the win and admitted that it was a strong effort at the end from his team. He lauded young Krishnamurthi and Pat Cummins for their performances. Elaborating on the win after the game in the post-match presentation, he explained:\n\n\"Pretty good result. The boys did a great job in the back end of the batting innings and then came out strong with the ball. (On Krishnamurthi) He's a young kid who's got so much talent. Huge pluses for him today. It was a pretty big innings in the context of the game. 20 odds in a game like this is huge.\n\n\"(On Cummins )He is a world-class player, just having him in the group speaking cricket calms the group. Great for the balance of the team as well. We want to try and win every game, we go back to Dallas and we want to reassess quickly and hopefully, we can get a bit of momentum out of this one,\" he concluded."

Travis Head and Andries Gous led the charge with impressive half-centuries, propelling Washington to a formidable total of 182/5 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, Washington's openers, Steve Smith and Travis Head, provided a steady start. However, Smith was dismissed by Rashid Khan in the fifth over after scoring 8 off 10 balls. Head then took control and formed a crucial partnership with Andries Gous. Their combined efforts helped Washington cross the 100-run mark by the 11th over.\n\nHead's aggressive innings of 54 off 33 balls included nine fours and two sixes before he was caught at long-on by Rashid Khan off Romario Shepherd’s bowling in the next over. Glen Maxwell followed soon after, despite being dropped earlier by Steven Taylor. Rashid Khan eventually dismissed Maxwell in the 16th over for 15 off 14 balls.\n\nIn the final overs, Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra accelerated the scoring rate. Gous reached his half-century in the 19th over, while Ravindra hammered two sixes and a four off Trent Boult in the same over, adding 23 runs.

Romario Shepherd and Trent Boult showed some resistance by adding a quickfire partnership of 33 runs from just 16 balls.\n\nMaxwell Seals Victory\n\nShepherd’s valiant effort ended in the 11th over when he was dismissed for a brisk 25 off just 14 balls. Maxwell wrapped up proceedings for Washington Freedom by taking two wickets in the same over. He removed Boult (16 off 13) on his first delivery and Ehsan Adil (0 off 2) on his third ball, bowling out MI New York for just 88 runs.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Andries Gous:59 off48; Travis Head:54off33; Kieron Pollard:2/14in2overs) beat MI New York(Romario Shepherd:25off14; Trent Boult:16off13; Jasdeep Singh:3/14in3overs)by94runs.\n\nThis comprehensive win highlights Washington Freedom's strong form this season as they continue their quest for glory in Major League Cricket.\n\nStory first published: Wednesday, July 17, 2024, 14:33 [GST]"

Saurabh Netravalkar and Glenn Maxwell led the attack, with Netravalkar taking 4 wickets and Maxwell claiming 3.\n\nWashington’s chase was highlighted by a bizarre incident in the second over when Andre Russell’s fiery delivery broke Travis Head’s bat into two pieces, with the upper half flying towards mid-wicket. Despite this, Head and Steve Smith forged a brilliant opening partnership of 79 runs. Head smashed a quickfire 54, including six sixes, before being dismissed in the ninth over.\n\nSteve Smith anchored the innings with an unbeaten 42, guiding Washington to reach the target comfortably in just 16 overs. Rachin Ravindra and Andries Gous provided support as Washington Freedom finished at 130/2.\n\nLooking ahead, Washington Freedom will face MI New York in their next MLC encounter, while Los Angeles Knight Riders will take on Seattle Orcas in their upcoming match. The victory keeps Washington’s momentum strong in the league as they continue their quest for dominance in the season."

        "body": "It is only four games into the new season of Major League Cricket, but Saurabh Netravalkar has already gone past his tally of 10 wickets in the previous campaign. He has picked up 12 wickets for us so far this season at an astonishing average of 9.16 runs per wicket and a strike rate of 7.66.\n\nNetravalkar, who had a successful T20 World Cup 2024 campaign for the United States, has brought his rich vein of form into the MLC. The left-arm pacer was the USA’s top wicket-taker in the showpiece event with six wickets from six matches.\n\nNetravalkar averaged 20.83 and took a wicket every three overs he bowled (strike rate of 18.83) in the T20 World Cup. In a group where the USA were not even favorites to proceed to the Super 8, he, along with our wicketkeeper-batter Andries Gous, who finished as the USA’s top run-getter, took the team to the next round in a fairytale start to the country’s journey at ICC events.\n\nThe Mumbai-born Netravalkar earned accolades for his performance against Pakistan, where he bowled a high-pressure super over to win a thriller, and against India, getting the prized wickets of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.\n\nConsistent Performances\n\nNetravalkar had a tally of 10 wickets from six matches in MLC 2023, averaging 1.67 wickets per match. He picked up a wicket every 15.90 runs he conceded and for every 13.10 deliveries he bowled in the last edition.\n\nOur pacer finished as the joint fourth-highest wicket-taker overall in MLC 2023, with his 6/9 against the San Francisco Unicorns being the best figures recorded by any bowler in the MLC to date.\n\nComing into a new season, Netravalkar has become more lethal and consistent for us. His average wickets per match has moved up to three from 1.67 last year. The runs conceded per wicket has come down from 15.90 to 9.16 and balls per wicket has also reduced sharply from 13.10 to 7.66 compared to last year.\n\nNetravalkar’s economy has also marginally improved from 7.28 runs an over in 2023 to 7.17 currently. His clever variations and change of pace have made it difficult for batters to score against him with the dot-ball percentage going up from 42.75% last year to 52.17% this year.\n\nNetravalkar has had an excellent season so far in the MLC this year and his performance in the upcoming matches will be vital for us to go the distance."

Out of the four matches they have played, they have won only one. This puts them dead last in the points table with two points. On a two-match losing streak, this team needs to get a few positive results to turn around their season and they need to start winning some games now.\n\nAs for the LA Knight Riders, it could be argued that their season so far has been worse than that of the Orcas. Out of their five games so far, LA has won only one, lost three and one was washed out. They are only fourth on the table with three points because of their washed-out game against the San Francisco Unions. Out of the two reaming games, the Knight Riders have to win at least one for a place in the playoffs and a win here would give this side a solid boost.\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Match 1 MLC 2024: Match Details\n\nMatch: Seattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders, Major League Cricket match 14\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina\n\nDate & Time: Thursday, July 18, 12:30 AM (IST)/ July 17, 3:00 PM (local time)\n\nLive Broadcast and Streaming: Sony Sports Network, JioCinema App & Website\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Announced Squads\n\nSeattle Orcas Announced Squad\n\nWayne Parnell (C), Quinton de Kock (wk), Aaron Jones, Hammad Azam, Nauman Anwar, Heinrich Klaasen, Ryan Rickelton, Michael Bracewell, Shehan Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Waseem, Harmeet Singh, Nathan Ellis, Ali Sheikh, Obed McCoy, Nandre Burger, Lance Morris, Cameron Gannon, Ayan Desai, Zaman Khan\n\nLA Knight Riders Announced Squad\n\nSunil Narine (C), Jason Roy, Nitish Kumar, Unmukt Chand (wk), David Miller, Saif Badar, Alex Carey (wk), Adithya Ganesh (wk), Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Shadley van Chalkwyk, Corne Dry, Adam Zampa, Ali Khan, Josh Little, Spencer Johnson, Matthew Tromp, Derone Davis, Waqar Salamkheil\n\nCheck Out: Seattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Prediction MLC\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Pitch Report\n\nThis is one of the few pitches in modern T20 cricket (but maybe a typical pitch in the US) that is more bowling-friendly. This is a dry surface where the ball spins in the first innings. The pitch breaks down even more in the second, making it even more difficult to bat on.\n\nThe average score in the first inning here is somewhere around the 140-run mark, which falls drastically in the second inning, making batting first the common choice here after winning the toss.\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Weather Report\n\nThere is a heat advisory out in North Carolina, with the temperatures in the high 30s. The high humidity will make it feel like over 40 degrees Celcius.\n\nThe skies will be clear and cloudy periodically, with heavy thunderstorms and rains also expected. However, the match is not likely to be washed away. The winds will also be strong.\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Predicted Playing XI\n\nSeattle Orcas Predicted Playing XI\n\nRyan Rickelton, Shehan Jayasuriya, Quinton de Kock (wk), Heinrich Klaasen (C), Aaron Jones, Harmeet Singh, Hammad Azam, Cameron Gannon, Imad Wasim, Nandre Curger, Zaman Khan\n\nLA Knight Riders Predicted Playing XI\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine (C), Unmukt Chand, Shakib Al Hasan, Saif Badar, Nitish Kumar, David Miller, Andre Russell, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Head To Head Record\n\nMatches Played: 02\n\nSeattle Orcas Won: 01\n\nLA Knight Riders Won: 01\n\nNo Result: 00\n\nFirst Played: July 23, 2023\n\nLast Played: July 10, 2024\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Prediction MLC\n\nWhile this match will be highly affected by the toss, we can not keep that in mind while making a prediction. So instead, we will look back at the recent record of these two teams, which has been fairly similar in this tournament. It is clear that both these sides do not compete with the better team this season, seeing how they have lost most of their matches by a big margin.\n\nIn their game earlier this season, the Seattle Orcas won their one and only match, this team also seems to have a better bowling attack as a whole. But, the Knight Riders have a better spin attack, giving them a distinct advantage on this dry track.\n\nThe LA Knight Riders also seem to have a better batting order, making them the favorites to win this one.\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Prediction MLC: LA Knight Riders will defeat Seattle Orcas in the 1st Match of Major League Cricket 2024"

        "body": "Dallas-Fort Worth continues to expand its sports offerings, with the state of Texas taking a leading role by launching Cognizant Major League Cricket in the United States in 2023.\n\nTexas Super Kings, the Major League Cricket franchise based in Texas, is led by experienced South African and Top Order Batter Faf du Plessis, who returns for his second season. He is joined by wicketkeeper Devon Conway, Australian power-hitter Marcus Stoinis, fast-bowler Naveen Ul Haq and Team USA's Milind Kumar.\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) is the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States and began in 2023. Exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, MLC features superstars from around the world, bringing world-class T20 cricket to America.\n\nWith the 2024 season getting underway, here are some quick facts about MLC and what you can expect from T20 Cricket:\n\nWhere are the matches played?\n\nThe matches will take place at Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina. The full schedule and available tickets can be viewed here here.\n\nWho are the teams?\n\nThere are currently six teams in the MLC, representing different cities and regions in the United States: Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom.\n\nWho won last year?\n\nMI New York took victory in the inaugural MLC season of 2023 by defeating the Seattle Orcas.\n\nWhat is T20 Cricket?\n\nT20, or Twenty20, is a form of cricket.\n\nIt is a shortened format (approximately 3 hours) where each team has 20 overs (this comprises 120 balls) to score the most runs.\n\nIt is known for its explosive hitting, as the time constraints mean more motivation to hit big sixes and take risks. (Sixes are like home runs to all baseball fans).\n\nAn 'over' is the name given to six consecutive balls bowled by one 'bowler'. There are 20 of these overs in an 'inning'. There are two innings in a game.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nEach team consists of 11 batters who try to score more runs (points) than their opponent.\n\nThe fielding will attempt to retire all batters as quickly as possible to keep the run count low.\n\nA team earns one run when a batsman hits the ball and runs from one set of stumps to the other.\n\nTeams earn four runs for hitting the ball out of bounds and six runs for hitting the ball out of bounds without it touching the ground.\n\nThe bowler is the player who throws the ball at the stumps to knock off the bails. (The bowlers are the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball).\n\nWickets/stumps are the three vertical sticks with two smaller ones called bails that sit horizontally on top of them. The object is to knock the bails off.\n\nA player from the fielding team stands behind the stumps to catch the ball.\n\nThe white lines on the ground form the crease, this is where the wickets and the batsman should be positioned.\n\nWhat has MLC done for cricket in the US?\n\nMLC has revolutionized the cricket landscape in the US. Cognizant Major League Cricket recently achieved List-A status, recognized by the ICC as an official T20 league, making it America’s first domestic world-class tournament. The inaugural 2023 season was a huge success, with sold-out matches drawing millions of viewers worldwide. The recent T20 World Cup was played in the US and West Indies, and saw Team USA both co-host and participate in the tournament for the first time. Forty-seven of the players who played in the World Cup will remain in the US for MLC.\n\nMLC FAMILY DAY – SUNDAY SPECIAL\n\nMake your next family outing unforgettable. Enjoy a world-class cricket match and save big with a MLC family deal!\n\nWatch the world’s best cricketers this summer and take advantage of the new Family Offer, only on Sundays.
