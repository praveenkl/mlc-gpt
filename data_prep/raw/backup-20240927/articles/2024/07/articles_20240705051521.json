        "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nThe first match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas features the hosts, who have the rarity of home advantage in Major League Cricket, the Texas Super Kings, taking on the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nDATE & TIME: Friday 5th July, 2024 - USA ET – 8:30pm / USA PT – 5:30pm / West Indies – 7:30pm & Saturday 6th July, 2024 - UK – 1:30am / South Africa – 2:30am / Pakistan – 5:30am / India – 6:00am / Bangladesh – 6:30am / Australia – 10:30am\n\nVENUE: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, Texas, United States\n\nWEATHER: 30c or 86 F with no rain expected\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: EXPLOITING HOME ADVANTAGE\n\nIn the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in 2023, the Texas Super Kings finished in the top two of a six-team table but they were eventually beaten in the Challenger by MI New York. However, with a very CSK-influenced leadership group of coach Stephen Fleming and captain Faf du Plessis are expected to come back with a bang in 2024.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: THE RECOVERY OF LAKR\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders endured a very difficult first ever season of Major League Cricket as they finished rock-bottom. They begun their season with four successive hammerings before a slender two-wicket defeat of eventual finalists and already league winners Seattle Orcas in their final game and there will need to be a real leap from LAKR this season.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLLL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Texas Super Kings will have the benefit of playing at probably the better of the two batting tracks in this tournament, at least that was the case in the ICC T20 World Cup, so there will be pressure on their top order. South Africa captain Aiden Markram didn’t have the best of World Cups with the bat but began to find some touch in the semi-final against Afghanistan and backing him to hit the ground running as TSK’s top batter in this match seems a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, TSK are set to try and damage teams with either smart change up bowling from Dwayne Bravo and Marcus Stoinis or spin with Noor Ahmad and Mitchell Santner. The best bet for them, though, to take two or more wickets in this match will be via their point of difference bowler, the excellent Naveen-ul-Haq.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nCaptained by Sunil Narine, LAKR perhaps lack a bit of depth and aggression in their batting lineup right at the top of the order but there is middle-order hitting with the likes of Shakib Al Hasan and Andre Russell. Their biggest threat, though, will be David Miller and, on what should and could be a good batting surface, backing a decent Miller score of 30+ runs seems a good bet.\n\nBowling-wise, LAKR do have the likes of Adam Zampa, Josh Little and Spencer Johnson to count on but good value could well be found in backing their domestic talents with both Ali Khan and Shadley van Schalkwyk involved. Ali Khan had a strong World Cup and backing him to take two or more of TSZ’s wickets may be worth a shot.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS VS LOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nWith just two venues in use during the 2024 Major League Cricket season, the Texas Super Kings will effectively be playing ‘home’ games at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas and whilst that seems like a nominal advantage in such a peculiar and short franchise tournament, that factor combined with their well rounded squad and LAKR’s lack of real star quality at the top with either bat or ball, as well as their failure last season, backing the Super Kings looks strong here."

        "date": "Thu Jul  4 08:40:12 2024",
        "body": "After a successful inaugural season in 2023, Major League Cricket (MLC) is all set to start the second season in 2024 which will commence from July 5 to July 28.\n\nUnlike the first season's 15 league games, this season will have 21 matches in the first round of the tournament followed by four playoff games.\n\nIn the opener of the season, on the 5th of July, the defending champions MI New York, led by Kieron Pollard will take on last year's runner-ups, Seattle Orcas, led by Wayne Parnell in Church Street Park, Morrisville at 01.00 hours (IST).\n\nLater on the same day, Faf du Plesiss' Texas Super Kings will face Sunil Narine-led Los Angeles Knight Riders in Grand Prairie, Dallas at 06.00 hours (IST). Dallas' Grand Prairie stadium will host all four playoff games from July 25 to July 29.\n\nIn the inaugural season of MLC in 2023, MI New York's Nicholas Pooran top scored in the tournament with 388 runs in 8 innings followed by his IPL teammate Quinton de Kock at 264 in 7 innings. Pooran was also adjudged as the Player of The Tournament.\n\nTrent Boult, MI New York's lead pacer was the highest wicket-taker of the season with 22 wickets in 8 games followed by the Aussie duo of Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye at joint-second with 11 wickets each.\n\nBalanced San Francisco Unicorns aim for the finish line.\n\nCaptain: Corey Anderson\n\nCoach: Shane Watson\n\nHow did they fare last season: Group Stage\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns wrapped up their chequered campaign after snatching defeat from a winning position in their final group stage game against the Texas Super Kings. Reeling at 92 for 5 in the 14th over, TSK romped home with 5 balls to spare as Milind Kumar and Daniel Sams dashed the Unicorns hopes in a matter of minutes. Unicorns kicked off life at MLC in spectacular fashion against the might of MI New York, beating a much fancied opposition by 22 runs. The game also dragged Corey Anderson from cricketing oblivion after a dazzling knock of 91 off 52 deliveries. Anderson closed out the tournament as the Unicorns' highest run getter with 190 runs in 5 games.\n\nUnicorns drafted in old war horse Liam Plunkett as the primary pick for $70,000 in the draft last year. The 39 year old was worth his weight in gold, overshadowing the younger brigade of Carmi Le Roux and Haris Rauf in terms of wickets and ECON. The tournament also proved to be a nightmare for captain Aaron Finch at the sunset of his career, labouring to 68 runs and striking at a dismal 88. Unicorns stop-start campaign embodied the returns of their international stars including the likes of Marcus Stoinis and Finn Allen who failed to muster a single score of over 40 runs in 5 innings.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nThe Unicorns made some sweeping changes to their international rosters. The franchise will pin high hopes on their bumper signing of Pat Cummins. There would have been a temptation to parachute in Cummins as the captain following the leadership vacuum with the retirement of Aaron Finch but the Unicorns management bestowed the captaincy to Anderson keeping in mind his local wherewithals. World cricket's latest sensation Jake Fraser McGurk would hope to carry where he left off from the IPL where he scored 330 runs striking at 234.04 while Kiwi, Finn Allen manages to retain his spot after a pedestrian season with the bat. Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford have been entrusted to add the muscle in the middle order while fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Matt Henry will find themselves at the core of the Unicorns bowling attack.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\nThe Unicorns went all out to grab former Pakistan U19 captain Hassan Khan at the MLC domestic draft this year. Khan bagged a top drawer $75,000 contract for putting on a splendid all round show in last year's Minor League Cricket tournament, amassing 220 runs in 5 innings at a S/R of 181 to go with his tally of 11 wickets at an ECON of under 5. Khan will form a troika with left arm spinning all rounders Sanjay Krishnamurthy and Karima Gore. Former West Indies wicket-keeper Jahmar Hamilton has finally been rewarded for his stellar show in the Minor League season after season. Liam Plunkett comes back for yet another MLC season in what may finally be his swansong from the sport while Carmi Le Roux has been retained to form the only left hand seaming option for the Unicorns.\n\nProbable XI : Jake Fraser McGurk, Finn Allen, Josh Inglis, Corey Anderson, Sherfane Rutherford, Tajinder Singh, Hassan Khan, Liam Plunkett, Pat Cummins, Haris Rauf, Carmi Le Roux\n\nSeattle Orcas: De Kock, Klaasen key for glory.\n\nCaptain: Wayne Parnell\n\nCoach: Pravin Amre\n\nHow did they fare last season: Runners Up\n\nSeattle Orcas stormed into the finals last year, dropping only a solitary league game in their march to the final. The Orcas were besieged at the final frontier by a whirlwind Nicholas Pooran century that counterpunched Quinton de Kock's swashbuckling 87. Orcas played some phenomenal cricket throughout the tournament on the back of some brilliant individual performances. Heinrich Klaasen's devastating knock of 110* off 44 deliveries sealed a final over thriller against a packed MI New York bowling lineup. His unravelling of Rashid Khan for a 26-run over is seen as a major inflexion point in his career.\n\nImad Wasim spun a web around the rest of the teams throughout the tournament. Bringing all his experience into play to bowl the tough powerplay overs, coming out unscathed with an economy of 6.33 and a total tally of 10 wickets in 7 games. USA World Cup star Harmeet Singh proved to be a crucial understudy to Imad as the duo fed off each other to wear down the opposition. De Kock kicked on with three half-centuries in the latter half of the tournament to top the batting charts after an indifferent start to the tournament.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nThe Orcas opted for a major overhaul to their international roster. With Dasun Shanaka, Dwayne Pretorius and Shimron Hetmyer being seen as surplus to requirements, the franchise looked to fill in obvious gaps in their roster. Pakistan death bowling specialist Zaman Khan and Proteas' new pace sensation are a couple of key signings for the Orcas this year to aid captain Wayne Parnell at the fag end of an innings. Ryan Rickleton joins De Kock and Klaasen in an already South Africa-heavy set-up. Orcas also bring in some Kiwi flavour with off-spinning allrounder Michael Bracewell in their bowling mix in addition to Imad Wasim.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\nOrcas find themselves rich in all-round talent with Shubham Ranjane, Harmeet Singh and Hamad Azam in their ranks. Ranjane proved to be a handful with his electric fielding, his array of slower balls and valuable cameos lower down the order in the inaugural season. Nauman Anwar and Shehan Jayasuriya bring in the international pedigree to their batting lineup. Anwar especially was seen to play the perfect foil for De Kock at the top of the order with some understated knocks. Cameron Gannon, an American-born Aussie state cricketer provides further depth to the Orcas pace battery. The Orcas drafted back USA vice-captain Aaron Jones in a supplemental draft in the wake of his monumental 94* in the World Cup opener.\n\nProbable XI: Quinton De Kock, Nauman Anwar, Shehan Jayasuriya, Heinrich Klaasen, Ryan Rickleton, Imad Wasim, Harmeet Singh, Shubham Ranjane, Zaman Khan, Wayne Parnell, Cameron Gannon\n\nTexas Super Kings: Star batters to backup unheralded bowlers\n\nTexas\n\nCaptain:Faf Du Plesis\n\nCoach: Stephen Fleming\n\nHow did they fare last season: Knockouts\n\nThe crowd frenzy that surrounded the Texas Super Kings in Dallas invoked a strong feeling of deja vu amongst the Super Kings fans. This unwavering support laid the first bricks to build yet another hollowed fortress 5,000 miles away from their spiritual home in Chennai. TSK kicked off their campaign last year with a thumping home win against a star studded LA Knight Riders. Devon Conway and David Miller chipped in with sparkling half centuries on that day but mostly struggled thereafter to match their opening salvo. To compound their batting woes captain Faf Du Plessis failed to cross 14 runs in any of his 7 innings while Milind Kumar was the lone half centurion among the domestics.\n\nFormer Peshawar Zalmi leg spinner Mohammad Mohsin proved to be the domestic find of the season for TSK. Mohsin started off with a bang, bamboozling the LAKR with a spell of 4 for 8 on the opening night. He further made heads turn with back to back strikes at a pivotal point in a low scorer against eventual champions MI New York, including pinning Keiron Pollard dead in front on the first ball. Dwayne Bravo turned the clock back with a ballistic 76 off 39 deliveries in their second game against Washington Freedom at the age of 39 but his body failed to last the tournament which in a way derailed the balance of the team and therefore the hopes of clinching the title for TSK.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nMatheesha Pathirana's unavailability had Stephen Fleming make an SOS call to Bravo. The 40 year old Super Kings loyalist will partner with Afghanistan's Naveen-ul-Haq to shoulder death over responsibilities for TSK. Du Plessis, who will turn 40 half way into the tournament, will take over the reins for yet another season. Aiden Markram, meanwhile, will have little time to shake off the world cup heartbreak as the South African captain is expected to line up for the opening game on July 5. The tournament also provides an excellent opportunity for Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner to find their form after missing out in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Conway would particularly be itching to go after being sidelined from the IPL owing to a fractured thumb. Marcus Stoinis will don the yellow this year after a stint with the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural season along with fellow Western Australian, Aaron Hardie.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\nMilind Kumar is expected to be the key middle order lynchpin for TSK with his experience. TSK have entrusted 18 year old South African born wicket keeper batsman Joshua Tromp as their first pick in this year's domestic draft. TSK's second draft pick, little known left arm spinner Raj Nannan hailing from Guyana surprised many in the American cricket circles. Nannan will form a spin troika with leggies Mohammad Mohsin and Zia Shehzad. Rusty Theron's retirement leaves the weight of the fast bowling mantle on the USA domestic trio of Cameron Stevenson, Calvin Savage and Zia Ul-Haq.\n\nProbable XI: Faf Du Plessis, Devon Conway, Milind Kumar, Aiden Markram, Marcus Stoinis, Joshua Tromp, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Stevenson, Naveen Ul Haq, Mohammad Mohsin, Raj Nannan\n\nBrute power, rounded bowling attack provides MI New York impetus to reclaim glory\n\nCaptain: Kieron Pollard\n\nCoach: Robin Peterson\n\nHow did they fare last season: Champions\n\nMI New York's stop start campaign peaked at the right juncture after failing to sustain winning momentum in the league stage. Kieron Pollard's unfortunate shoulder injury in the final league game paved the way for Nicholas Pooran to steward a rocky MINY ship. After securing the 4th spot by a hair's breadth, MINY gathered steam in the knockouts. Pooran's men came back from behind to stitch a 3 match winning streak with the captain capping off their historic run with an innings for the ages, a cracking of 137* off 55 deliveries in the grand finale.\n\nPooran's form remained red hot throughout the tournament, striking at 167 for his 388 runs. Tim David matched him stroke for stroke scoring at a similar clip, ending with 209 runs in his limited opportunities lower down the order. Left arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige proved to be the ultimate domestic find of the season for MINY. A nagging left arm spinner and a livewire on the field, Kenjige showed heart to bowl the tough overs in the powerplay with aplomb. Up against some superstars of T20 cricket, little known Kenjige topped the economy charts for the tournament, going at a mere 5.73 RPO in his first taste of top flight cricket.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nMINY have largely called upon their core group of players that have served them elsewhere under the MI banner. MI talisman Kieron Pollard will pull up his socks yet again for a franchise he has served for more than 14 seasons. Tim David and Nicholas Pooran will be back in MI colours looking to emulate their inaugural season heroics. South African youngster Dewald Brewis has been afforded yet another chance to find a breakthrough T20 season. They have also roped in West Indies all-rounder Romario Shepherd to add to their middle order muscle who is also an adequate backup for their jacked up pace attack in Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult and Anrich Nortje. MINY also have successfully retained Rashid Khan to form one of the most complete bowling attacks going around in the tournament.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\n37 year old former Gujarat leg spinning all-rounder Sunny Patel makes a surprise comeback to professional cricket after his move to USA. USA captain Monank Patel is expected to be back at the top of the order after being sidelined by a shoulder injury during the world cup. Steven Taylor finds himself under the injury cloud after choosing to play with a shoulder niggle. Opener Shayan Jahangir will look to further capitalise on some solid starts he had provided in the first edition for the team. MINY would hope former Pakistani pacer Ehsan Adil brings in the required depth in the pace battery to step in the role as a container in the presence of a very strong international pace attack. American born and South African raised left handed opening batsman Ruben Clinton has been rewarded with a contract for his exploits in the minor league.\n\nProbable XI: Monank Patel, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard, Tim David, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult, Nosthush Kenjige, Ehsan Adil."

Smith, who was one of the few Australians to sign up with the Washington outfit including the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and a new head coach in Ricky Ponting, will be leading a T20 side for the first time since 2017 when he was the captain of Rising Pune Supergiant in IPL 2017.\n\nSmith was excited for the opportunity and was looking forward to the season. \"Yeah, it's been good. Just getting to know all the guys. [I have] been here for a couple of days now, played one practice game, got another today. Looking forward to this season, I think we've got a really good squad, good bunch of guys and excited for what this season holds,\" Smith said in a video posted by Washington Freedom.\n\nThis is also the second time that Smith will be working with Ponting as a coach in a T20 setup after IPL 2021 with the Delhi Capitals. With the likes of Andries Gous, Saurabh Netravalkar, experienced locals combined with overseas stars not just the Aussies but with Rachin Ravindra, Marco Jansen, and Lockie Ferguson at the disposal, Ponting and Smith have a variety of options to play with.\n\nThe Freedom begin their campaign against the defending champions MI New York on Saturday, July 6 at Church Street Park in Morrisville. Smith will be hoping to lead Freedom to further than eliminator where their campaign came to an end last year."

Oh, and it’s been some revolution this! From introducing the game to ordinary Americans to becoming a raging success, Major League Cricket is all set to push the boundaries further in 2024. IT’S ONE DAY AWAY. Okay, you’ve got questions? We hear you? Here’s your cheat sheet to everything you need to know..\n\nAnother cricket party? No wait, didn’t the World Cup just get over?\n\nThe World Cup was just the start, the MLC will now take it to the crescendo! The second season is here – six iconic cities, two venues, 23 days, and MI New York out there to defend their crown. A host of world class cricketers have assembled in town, and are all set to inspire another whole generation of young American fans.\n\nSo who’s playing? What’s the format?\n\nThere’s the defending champions, MI New York, the runner’s up, Seattle Orcas, Faf du Plessis-led Texas Super Kings, fresh from winning the IPL, Sunil Narine-led LA Knight Riders, fresh from inducting Pat Cummins, San Francisco Unicorns, and the Washington Freedom.\n\nEach team would play seven league games, and the top four will then proceed to the playoffs. The first leg of the tournament would take place at Church Street Park in Morrisville, before he caravan moved to the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nCould you recap season one please?\n\nSo we won. It was a tight road until the final though, with MI New York having to win their last four games to win the title. And they did it in style, with Trent Boult getting four-fer after four-fer, young Dewald Brevis playing some clutch knocks in the middle-order, Tim David finishing games for fun like only he can, and Monank Patel getting us off to fliers. Come the final, against Seattle Orcas, it was the Nicholas Pooran show, with a blazing 137-run-knock to give us our moment of history!\n\nWoah, Defending Champs! What’s new this time then?\n\nAnrich Nortje, with his 150kph thunderbolts, is all set to don the Blue and Gold, and it is going to be a dream to watch him bowl in tandem with Trent Boult and Kagiso Rabada. Also Romario Shepherd, fresh from his assault in the IPL for Mumbai Indians and then in the T20 World Cup for West Indies, is here too. Four other youngsters, Rushil Ugarkar, Heath Richards, Ruben Clinton and Sunny Patel have come into the mix as well. But the core of the team remains the same, with Kieron Pollard, the MI #OneFamily legend, along with Nicholas Pooran, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Tim David and the USA star players like Steven Taylor, Monank Patel and Shayan Jahangir.\n\nAnd what’s new with the MLC in 2024?\n\nA few extra matches. Last year saw each team play a single round-robin, but this time there are two extra games in the league. It’s just gotten bigger. But should remain the same though is the passion the league generated among the supporters, who thronged to the stadium in large numbers.\n\nOkay, I’m already excited..what’s the schedule?\n\nJuly 5, 3:30pm EDT (July 6, 1am IST) - MI New York vs Seattle Orcas\n\nJuly 6, 3pm EDT (July 7, 12:30am IST) - Washington Freedom vs MI New York\n\nJuly 12, 3pm EDT (July 13, 12:30am IST) - MI New York vs Texas Super Kings\n\nJuly 14, 7:30pm CDT (July 15, 6am IST) - Texas Super Kings vs MI New York\n\nJuly 16, 7:30pm CDT (July 17, 6am IST) - MI New York vs Washington Freedom\n\nJuly 18, 7:30pm CDT (July 19, 6am IST) - MI New York vs San Francisco Unicorns\n\nJuly 21, 7:30pm CDT (July 22, 6am IST) - LA Knight Riders vs MI New York"

Despite his wealth of expertise, Smith was left off of Australia's T20 World Cup 2024 squad and was only selected as a commentator.\n\nThe MLC 2024, which kicks off on July 6, will see Smith leading Washington Freedom. This American-based T20 league aims to expand the sport's reach in the USA.\n\nSmith's leadership experience, which includes leading Australia to numerous victories across formats and captaining IPL teams like Rising Pune Supergiant and Rajasthan Royals, will be invaluable for Washington Freedom.\n\nIn the previous MLC season, Washington Freedom reached the playoffs under the captaincy of Moises Henriques but were eliminated by MI New York, the eventual champions.\n\nThe team has bolstered its roster this year with key signings, including Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, and new head coach Ricky Ponting.\n\nGiven his outstanding record, many are excited to see Smith return to captaincy. Smith scored 2485 runs in 103 matches during his IPL career, including a century and eleven half-centuries. In 67 games, he has amassed 1094 runs and 17 wickets in international Twenty20 cricket.\n\nWashington Freedom will begin their campaign against defending champions MI New York at Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nFans look forward to Smith's strategic acumen and batting skills, hoping he will lead the team to victory and help elevate the league's profile in the USA.\n\nWith his appointment, Washington Freedom aims to build on last year's performance and strive for the championship."

The high-octane face-off is scheduled at Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nNY vs SEA: Team Previews\n\nMI New York\n\nLed by Kieron Pollard, MI New York have a well-balanced squad heading to the competition. Nicholas Pooran, who played a match-winning knock in previous year's final, will spearhead MI's batting unit alongside the swashbuckling duo of Pollard and Tim David.\n\nAdditionally, the eyes will also be on Steven Taylor and Dewald Brevis, who can stun the opposition with scintillating stroke play at the top.\n\nMI New York's fast bowling unit looks ruthless, studded with three hostile pacers- Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje. Meanwhile, the presence of Rashid Khan as the lead spinner makes their bowling unit lethal irrespective of the conditions.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nSeattle Orcas were the runners-up in MLC 2023 [X]\n\nOn the other hand, Seattle Orcas have a fantastic South African batting core, comprising Ryan Rickelton, Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen.\n\nAaron Jones, who grabbed limelight during the recently held T20 World Cup, will bat in the middle order, with Michael Bracewell and Imad Wasim playing as the specialist all-rounders.\n\nNandre Burger is expected to emerge as the wrecker-in-chief with the ball for the Orcas, who will also rely on Wayne Parnell, Obed McCoy and Zaman Khan to succeed in the tournament.\n\nNY vs SEA: Match details & Live streaming\n\nNY vs SEA: Church Street Park pitch report\n\nConsidering the game will start at 3.30 PM local time, we don't expect appreciable seam movement for the fast bowlers during the first innings.\n\nHowever, the ball generally moves off the deck in Morrisville under the lights, so the pacers will have their tails up in the latter half.\n\nOn the other hand, the spinners will play minimal role in the game, while the batters would like to use the track's pace and bounce for scoring runs.\n\nIt's the first game of the season, so expect the toss-winner to bowl first. But considering the seamers get significant assistance in the second half, don't be surprised if the toss-winning side bats first.\n\nNY vs SEA: Probable playing XIs\n\nMI New York: Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Nicholas Pooran (WK), Dewald Brevis, Monank Patel, Kieron Pollard (C), Rashid Khan, Nosthush Kenjige, Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Ehsan Adil\n\nSeattle Orcas: Quinton de Kock (WK), Ryan Rickelton, Nauman Anwar, Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen, Hammad Azam, Imad Wasim, Harmeet Singh, Wayne Parnell (C), Nandre Burger, Cameron Gannon\n\nNY vs SEA: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nNY vs SEA: Winner Prediction\n\nRiding on their overall balance and an incredibly potent bowling attack, MI New York might pip Seattle Orcas to earn their first points in MLC 2024."

The tournament will catch the eyes of avid cricket followers after the brilliant show of the US in the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nWe at OneCricket have already taken a deep dive into the squad of four teams that will participate in this tournament. In this article, we will take a look at Washington Freedom.\n\nWashington Freedom finished third in the points table last year. However, they were defeated in the Eliminator by MI-New York, the eventual champions, and had to bow out of the tournament. With some new recruits onboard and as a much stronger-looking outfit, WAF will look to better their performance and eventually lift their maiden MLC title.\n\nHere is a look at the Washington Freedom squad for the MLC 2024.\n\nBatters: Steven Smith, Akhilesh Reddy, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed\n\nAll-rounders: Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra\n\nBowlers: Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nStrength of Washington Freedom for MLC 2024\n\nVariety and depth in the overseas recruits\n\nThe Washington Freedom have recruited some high-quality overseas players ahead of the MLC 2024 season. These recruits will give them strength ahead of the season alongwith variety and flexibility to field teams based on the strength of the opposition and the playing conditions.\n\nWhile Steven Smith, Travis Head and Rachin Ravindra will add stability to the top order, Glenn Maxwell, alongside Andries Gous, will give them the firepower in the middle order.\n\nIn the bowling department, they will have Akeal Hosein in the spin department, with Lockie Ferguson, Andre Tye and Marco Jansen rounding up in the pace front. An overall look gives us the idea that they have plenty of resources to use as per the playing conditions, and they go with a 'horses for courses' policy.\n\nWeaknesses of Washington Freedom for MLC 2024\n\nLack of experience in the spin department\n\nAkeal Hosein will be in charge of the team's spin department. Besides leading this aspect of the team, he will have the majority of the task of controlling the opposition in the middle overs and picking up wickets. There is a lack of experienced spinners in the squad, and the skipper will have to turn to Glenn Maxwell and even Rachin Ravindra to get some efficient overs in the middle overs.\n\nOver-dependency on Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell for power hitting\n\nMost of the batters in the Washington Freedom look like grafters. They will take time to settle down before shifting gears. Thus the Freedom will have an over-dependency on Travis Head at the top and Glenn Maxwell in the middle order to increase the team's scoring rate.\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted XI for the first match"

Known for his stellar leadership record with Australia, Smith brings a wealth of experience to the role, having led his national team to numerous victories in Tests, ODIs, and T20Is.\n\nThe franchise made the official announcement on social media platform X, where they welcomed Smith with the tagline, “Oh Captain, Our Captain, Smudge is all set to lead the Freedom squad for #MLC2024.”\n\nSmith, renowned for his impactful performances in cricket leagues worldwide, previously captained IPL teams like Pune Warriors, Rising Pune Supergiants, and Rajasthan Royals. His leadership stint with Rising Pune Supergiants saw them reach the IPL 2017 final.\n\nPreviously, Moises Henriques, Smith's former teammate from Australia, led Washington Freedom in the MLC 2023 season, where the team reached the playoffs but fell short against inaugural champions MI New York.

Bowling first will help and anything over 175 runs will be a good score on the surface.\n\nNY vs SEA Head-to-Head Record\n\nNY vs SEA Probable Playing XIs\n\nMI New York:\n\nSteven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Monank Patel (wk) Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard (c), Tim David, Dewald Brewis, Rashid Khan, Romario Shepherd, Trent Boult, Ehsan Adil,\n\nSeattle Orcas:\n\nQuinton de Kock (wk), Nauman Anwar, Shehan Jayasuriya, Heinrich Klaasen, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Wasim, Michael Bracewell, Wayne Parnell (c), Harmeet Singh, Obed McCoy, Cameron Gannon\n\nNY vs SEA Probable Best Players of the Match\n\nProbable Best Batter:\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nWest Indies international Nicholas Pooran was sensational in the recently concluded T20 World Cup. Lately, he has been terrific in the shortest of the game and is difficult to stop when he is in the zone. Against a moderate bowling unit of Seattle, Pooran can wreak havoc.\n\nProbable Best Bowler:\n\nRashid Khan\n\nLike Pooran, Rashid was incredible in the T20 World Cup. He was one of the forces to reckon with, with the ball for Afghanistan and given his form, the spinner can prove to be dangerous.\n\nToday’s Match Prediction: MI New York to win the match\n\nScenario 1\n\nMI New York win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 40-50\n\nSEA: 155-175\n\nMI New York win the match\n\nScenario 2\n\nSeattle Orcas win the toss and opt to bowl.\n\nPowerplay: 35-45\n\nNY: 175-195\n\nMI New York win the match"

There are two T20 tournaments in front of me one is MLC and the other one is the Global T20 League in Canada and let me see where I stand after playing these two tournaments because I need to understand [how I feel],” Shakib was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.\n\n“There is international cricket and there is a series against Pakistan, and I am planning till that point of time and not planning beyond that. Now I don't have time to plan for three-four years and so planning for three to six months is better and later will think about my next plan and so till now I am planning till the Pakistan series,” he added.\n\nNone of Pakistan or Bangladesh have so far announced the squads for the series that will be played in the World Test Championship 2023-25 cycle.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that both Pakistan and Bangladesh recently participated in the T20 World Cup 2024. Babar Azam’s side suffered a group-stage exit but the Tigers made it to the Super 8 of the tournament."

        "body": "The highly anticipated Major League Cricket campaign of 2024 is all set to commence on Saturday, July 6th, at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. The Texas Super Kings will lock horns against the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the second game of the league at 6 a.m. IST. Notably, the Texas Super Kings suffered a defeat in the playoffs of the last edition against the Seattle Orcas. However, the Faf du Plessis-led side once again will be looking to have a great start at this edition. The side has finished in second place in MLC 2023 with three wins and two losses.\n\nOn the other hand, Knight Riders had a poor edition of MLC 2023 as they failed to make it to the playoffs and ended up in the last spot with just a single win and four losses. Thus, they will be looking to turn things around in the forthcoming edition.\n\nThe two teams will be in cricket action in the second game of the tournament. In addition to this, both squads will be eager to start the tournament with a winning record to boost their rankings in the points table."
