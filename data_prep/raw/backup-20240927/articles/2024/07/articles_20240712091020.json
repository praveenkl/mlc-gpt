        "date": "Mon Jul  8 13:00:00 2024",
        "body": "07/08/2024 - 09:00 AM\n\nROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Major League Cricket’s Washington Freedom and Verizon are pleased to announce a partnership that will see the nation’s leading telecommunications company become a team sponsor for the upcoming 2024 Major League Cricket season beginning in early July. This partnership brings together two innovative organizations with shared values and a joint commitment to excellence, teamwork and community engagement.\n\nCricket is the second most watched sport in the world with an estimated 2.5 billion global fans and is rapidly expanding in the United States. The U.S. is hosting the ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup in partnership with the West Indies in June of 2024, and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will feature cricket for the first time since the 1900 Olympics.\n\nThe Washington Freedom play in Major League Cricket (MLC), a professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league. MLC began play on July 13, 2023, with six teams representing major US cities. The inaugural season saw more than 70,000 fans in attendance throughout an 18-day tournament that was broadcast to 87 countries worldwide. The upcoming 2024 season is set to begin on July 5th, just a few days after the conclusion of the T20 World Cup.\n\n\"Verizon is a long-time leader in innovation and is one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. We are thrilled to have Verizon as a sponsor for the Washington Freedom in the second season of Major League Cricket,” said Sanjay Govil, owner of the Washington Freedom. “We look forward to another successful campaign in the upcoming season, and we are excited to have Verizon as part of the team.”\n\n“We’re excited to be on the ground floor of the growing cricket movement in the United States, and specifically in Washington, D.C., through our partnership with the Washington Freedom,\" said Chris Flood, Atlantic North Market President at Verizon. “We look forward to connecting with their dynamic and growing fan base, both on and off the cricket field, and we are incredibly proud to work with an organization that values innovation, teamwork and community engagement as much as we do.\"\n\nKey highlights of the partnership include:\n\nBranding Integration: Verizon’s logo will be featured on team helmets and caps, bringing visibility to a worldwide audience during games and events.\n\nYear-Round Community Initiatives: The collaboration will extend beyond the field and cricket season, with joint participation in Washington, D.C.-based community events, cultural festivities, concerts, and programs.\n\nAbout Washington Freedom\n\nThe Washington Freedom is a Major League Cricket team and the first professional cricket team to represent Washington, D.C. The team has partnered with Australia’s Cricket New South Wales, one of the world’s leading cricket entities. The team is owned by Sanjay Govil, an Indian-born American entrepreneur, who has a passionate belief in sport's ability to unite and inspire.

        "date": "Fri Jul 12 02:31:00 2024",
        "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nAfter finishing rock-bottom of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in 2023, the Los Angeles Knight Riders began this season well with a victory but now come into this one on the back of back-to-back defeats. The San Francisco Unicorns have picked up one win with one defeat in their opening two matches ahead of this clash in North Carolina.\n\nDATE & TIME: Saturday 13th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:00pm / USA PT – 12:00pm / West Indies – 2:00pm / UK – 8:00pm / South Africa – 9:00pm / Sunday 14th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:00am / India – 12:30am / Bangladesh – 1:00am / Australia – 5:00am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 32c o 89.6 F with rain forecast at the start of the match\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: THE SHODDY LAKR\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders began the 2024 Major League Cricket season with an impressive defence of what seemed to be a fairly small total when the Texas Super Kings fell 12 runs short of LAKR’s 162-7. Since then, though, they could not defend 165-6 against the San Francisco Unicorns and then also suffered a nine-wicket thumping to last season’s runners’ up, the Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWL\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: BOUNCING BACK\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns began their season with that aforementioned victory over LAKR in Dallas. Finn Allen led the way with 63 runs from 37 balls as they reached 166-4 in just 15.2 overs last week. In their second match of the tournament, they were skittled for just 127 by an experienced Texas Super Kings side before giving up the target in just 12.5 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: LWLLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nEven in victory, the Los Angeles Knight Riders simply haven’t scored enough runs. 162 shouldn’t have been enough to beat TSK and the two targets they have set since have been well below par. What did happen in their second game, though, was South African David Miller coming to the party with an unbeaten 44 at a strike rate of 200 and the thrilling middle-order bat is likely to be their top scorer if their misfiring top order get out early enough.\n\nWith the ball, they have a fair bit of variation with the likes of Ali Khan, Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan and Sunil Narine. However, they are heavily reliant on Aussie quick Spencer Johnson for wickets. The Unicorns go hard and should lose wickets so Johnson to take two or more poles would appear a good bet for that reason.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWith a top order that consists of the aforementioned Finn Allen as well as Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Short and Josh Inglis; the San Francisco Unicorns have the potential to do exactly what they have shown in their opening two matches; collapse in a heap or go hard and get a big score in no time. Short is the man in the best nick at the moment so him to score 30+ at another decent strike rate would be a worthy shout.\n\nIn the bowling department, the Unicorns have the experience of former England international Liam Plunkett but beyond that they are perhaps a bit blunt for the shortest format of the game with the consistently flattering to deceive Haris Rauf and more suited to Test match bowling of Abrar Ahmed. Plunkett remains their best chance of wickets outside of the powerplay so Plunkett to be their top bowler remains the best bet for this.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThis is a confusing one to predict a winner in because of the strengths and weakness of both sides. LAKR have the edge with the ball, whilst the Unicorns are certainly the more modern day and aggressive of the two sides with the bat. That said, if the top four of San Francisco, albeit Inglis dropped to five against TSK, can fire then they can easily overwhelm any team in the competition – and LAKR’s best bet, of experience with the ball, is still relatively weak. As a result, the Unicorns will be confident of doing the double over their opposition."

        "body": "Washington Freedom beat Seattle Orcas by 5 wickets, in Match 8 of the Major League Cricket 2024, at Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas today.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom, Match 8\n\nSeattle Orcas 124/10 (19.4 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom 127/5 (18.2 ov)\n\nResult - Washington Freedom won by 5 wickets\n\nSCORECARD\n\nManhattan\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nWashington Freedom edged out Seattle Orcas by five wickets in a tense low-scoring match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas on Thursday.\n\nLockie Ferguson (4/26) and Saurabh Netravalkar (3/18) shared seven wickets to bundle out Seattle Orcas to 124 in 19.4 overs. Lahiru Milantha (33 off 30) and Obus Pienaar (25 off 28) then anchored a crucial unbeaten 63-run partnership to guide Washington Freedom past their 125-run target with 10 balls to spare.\n\nWith this win, Washington Freedom moved to the top of the points table with 5 points from three matches, remaining the only unbeaten team in the tournament thus far.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas came out firing to defend a low total of 125 runs. Imad Wasim removed the dangerous Travis Head for a duck on the second ball of the innings, ending the over with a wicket maiden. Steve Smith and Rachin Ravindra then looked to rebuild with the counter-attack. They scored as many as 18 runs in the third over. Ravindra looked dangerous with the bat, but Nandre Burger dismissed him in the fifth over for 26 off 16 balls, which included three boundaries and two sixes. Smith (12 off 13) followed him back to the pavilion in the following over, leaving the Orcas at 47/3 after six overs.\n\nBoth Mukhtar Ahmed and Glenn Maxwell were given lifelines with dropped catches but couldn't capitalise on them. Ahmed (8 off 8) was dismissed by Burger in the eighth over, and Maxwell (10 off 11) fell to Harmeet, leaving their team struggling at 68/5 after 10 overs.\n\nDespite the dire situation, Washington Freedom batters Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar showed resilience as they cautiously approached the target. They helped Washington reach the 100-run mark in the 16th over, reducing the equation to 23 runs needed off 24 balls. Milantha (33* off 30) and Pienaar (31* off 30) constructed a match-winning partnership to help their side get past the winning line.\n\nEarlier in the contest, the Seattle Orcas had a shaky start to their innings. Nauman Anwar was dismissed cheaply for 3 off 9 balls by Saurabh Netravalkar in the second over. The Seattle batters struggled to accelerate on the slow batting track, managing only 35 runs in the Powerplay. Ryan Rickelton also fell for 4 off 11 balls to Lockie Ferguson in the sixth over.\n\nQuinton de Kock (24 off 19) failed to build on his start and was bowled by Ferguson in the eighth over, with Seattle struggling at 44/3 after eight overs.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen and Shubham Ranjane carefully constructed a crucial partnership that steadied Seattle's innings. However, Ranjane (12 off 17) was unfortunately run out on the first ball of the 14th over. Klaasen, batting as if on a different surface, completed his fifty in just 29 balls but was immediately caught by Mukhtar Ahmed at long-off off Marco Jansen in the 15th over. His crucial innings, which included four fours and three sixes, helped Seattle cross the 100-run mark in the 15th over.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington bowlers didn't allow the following batters to score big. Ferguson took two wickets in the 17th over, finishing his spell with four wickets. He removed Imad Wasim (4 off 6) and Hammad Azam (4 off 9) in his last over. Netravalkar then dismissed Harmeet Singh (2 off 3) in the following over, leaving Seattle struggling at 112/8 after 18 overs.\n\nSeattle managed to get nine runs in the penultimate over as Cameron Gannon (8 off 5) attempted to hit the ball as hard as possible. He struck a maximum, but was dismissed on his second attempt, as he got caught by Ferguson at long-off off Ian Holland's bowling. Netravalkar then removed Nandre Burger (3 off 6), thus bowling out the Orcas for 124 in 19.4 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-6 (Nauman Anwar - 1.6 ov), 2-34 (Ryan Rickelton - 5.5 ov), 3-44 (Quinton de Kock - 7.5 ov), 4-81 (Shubham Ranjane - 13.1 ov), 5-102 (Heinrich Klaasen - 14.3 ov), 6-107 (Imad Wasim - 16.2 ov), 7-110 (Hammad Azam - 16.6 ov), 8-112 (Harmeet Singh - 17.3 ov), 9-120 (Cameron Gannon - 18.5 ov), 10-124 (Nandre Burger - 19.4 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-0 (Travis Head - 0.2 ov), 2-34 (Rachin Ravindra - 4.2 ov), 3-43 (Steven Smith - 5.5 ov), 4-53 (Mukhtar Ahmed - 6.5 ov), 5-64 (Glenn Maxwell - 9.1 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nRyan Rickelton\n\nNauman Anwar\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nHammad Azam\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nImad Wasim\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nNandre Burger\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nZaman Khan\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nTravis Head\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nLahiru Milantha(WK)\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nIan Holland\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Friday, July 12, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas"

        "body": "Right then, that will be it from us for this contest. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. The action continues at the Major League Cricket, 2024. The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the MI New York at Church Street Park in Morrisville. That game will be played on July 13th and will start at 12.30 am IST (7.00 pm GMT, the previous day). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nSteve Smith, the Washington Freedom skipper, says that it was a hard-fought game. Adds that the top order did not great start but Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar played smart cricket and got the job done. Shares that it was a slow and low wicket and all the bowlers did a good job. Mentions that they had a few hiccups with the bat but glad to be on the winning front. Reckons that the wicket got a tad slow so it was important to cash on the powerplay and would have been easy if someone from the top order had made a 50-60 but he's happy that the middle and lower order got their chance and they came out victorious.\n\nThe losing skipper of Seattle Orcas, Heinrich Klaasen says they lost the game in the last four overs with the bat as they couldn't add a lot to the total and left with a below-par score. Adds that they are lacking that one guy in the last few overs who could give them the perfect balance with both bat and ball to finish things well. Mentions that they needed to pick up wickets early on and they did that as well but they were good 15-20 runs shot at the end with the bat. Closes by saying the pitch was good and had they been at 140-145 by the end of their innings, the result could have been different.\n\nLockie Ferguson is the Player of the Match for his stellar spell. He says that it’s a good start to the campaign and nice to get in full 40 overs. Adds that as a group, it’s been great. Mentions that he tried bowling in good areas and it worked well for them. Ends by sharing that Heinrich Klaasen was looking dangerous and he's that they got his wicket.\n\nRachin Ravindra is up for a chat. He says it wasn't easy in the middle to bat but it was easier to bat while the ball was new. Adds that Imad Wasim bowled a maiden first up but him being a left-hander was a match-up for him and the support staff backed him for taking it on and it worked for him. Mentions that they look to stick to their plans and today despite the fall of wickets they kept playing their brand of cricket and eventually won.\n\nEarlier today, Seattle Orcas were asked to bat first and they made a below-par score of 124 with only Heinrich Klaasen making an attacking fifty while the rest of the batting struggled. Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar accounted for seven wickets between them and broke the back of Seattle Orcas' batting. Seattle Orcas are stranded at the bottom of the table while Washington Freedom moves to the top position. It's still early days in the season but teams will want to make winning a habit.\n\nSeattle Orcas did not have a huge score to defend but they started well by picking an early wicket. They gave away a few freebies through the powerplay but came back strong to put a dent in the Washington Freedom batting. Nandre Burger was the pick of the bowlers taking 2 for 26 while Harmeet Singh, Imad Wasim, and Cameron Gannon chipped in with one apiece and kept it tight. Seattle Orcas have suffered their second loss of the season and will want to turnaround their campaign quickly.\n\nA hard-fought run chase from the Washington Freedom takes them to the top of the table and they are unbeaten in the season so far. Chasing a tricky score of 125 for the win, the Freedom lost Travis Head for a duck but Smith and Ravindra stuck a few boundaries and got their side to a decent start in the powerplay. The Seattle Orcas came back strongly and reduced the Freedom to 64 for 5 with all their big guns back in the hut. Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar joined hands and added an unbeaten 63-run stand to steer their side home. Lahiru Milantha made a steady 33 off 30 while Obus Pienaar chipped in with 31 crucial runs. Washington Freedom are the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far and will hope to keep it going.\n\nStrategic Break! Washington Freedom needs 32 off the final five overs. They are ahead in the game but the Seattle Orcas are giving it a real fight. A couple of wickets here would tilt the tide in favor of the Orcas. Washington Freedom will hope for Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar to carry on and take their side home to get two more points on the board."

        "body": "Faf du Plessis in action for Texas Super Kings during MLC 2024 (X.com)\n\nFor the seventh fixture of the Major League Cricket 2024 season, San Francisco Unicorns will be pitted against Texas Super Kings on July 11, 12.00 AM IST at Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nWhile Texas is yet to taste victory, the Unicorns kicked off the tournament on the right note.\n\nSFU vs TEX: Team Previews\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns' tournament-opening game against the Los Angeles Knight Riders in Dallas turned out to be a dominant outing for the former. They bowled well to restrict LAKR to 165 runs total before Finn Allen went ballistic in the chase.\n\nHe scored 63 off 27 deliveries to ensure the Unicorns are off to a flyer start. Moreover, Matthew Short's fiery contribution of 58 (26) steered Unicorns to a successful run chase with four overs left.\n\nOverall, it was a complete performance from both the departments and hence ahead of the upcoming game against Texas, the Unicorns will count themselves as favourites.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nOn the other hand, Texas Super Kings are struggling to find their footing into the MLC 2024 edition. After losing a close game to LAKR in the tournament opener, Texas were saved by rain gods in the following game against Washington Freedom.\n\nSkipper Faf du Plessis' century resulted in 203 runs in the first innings total for Texas, and it appeared good enough until Travis Head and Steve Smith unleashed carnage in the powerplay.\n\nHead's 32 (12) and Smith's 26 (13) blistering knocks steered Washington to 64 runs on board in just the first four overs before rain interrupted play. Due to a weak drainage system, the game couldn't resume and both teams were awarded a point each.\n\nHowever, it's safe to say, had the game resumed, Washington would have walked all over Texas in no time. Hence, the Super Kings will remain under a lot of pressure against the Unicorns.\n\nSFU vs TEX: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSFU vs TEX: Church Street Park Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at Church Street Park generally provides a fair contest between bat and ball. However, this MLC 2024 season, the surface has favoured the batters to a larger extent. The powerplay period will be crucial for both sides and with the looming threat of rain, chasing is a good option.\n\nSFU vs TEX: Probable Playing XIs\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Finn Allen, Josh Inglis (wk), Matthew Short, Corey Anderson (c), Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Brody Couch, Hassan Khan, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed\n\nTexas Super Kings: Devon Conway (wk), Faf du Plessis (c), Aaron Hardie, Joshua Tromp, Marcus Stoinis, Milind Kumar, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, Mohammad Mohsin, Naveen-ul-Haq, Zia-ul-Haq\n\nSFU vs TEX: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nSFU vs TEX: Winner Prediction\n\nConsidering the tournament's trend and condition evaluation, the San Francisco Unicorns are expected to beat the Texas Super Kings in the upcoming matchup."

Hence, such instances need to be avoided by Seattle in the future.\n\nWashington Freedom is a formidable side and will ask the right questions. Hence, Heinrich Klaasen and Co must stay vigilant and step up as a unit to advance against Washington.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nOn the other hand, Washington Freedom have been unlucky as their second game got washed out due to rain. Even in the tournament opener, they dodged a bullet with the results turning in their favour after the DLS method was enforced.\n\nChasing 155 runs against MI New York, Steve Smith stamped his authority with 46 off 28 runs knock, and before rain halted the game, Washington had 55 runs on board at the loss of one wicket. They were four runs ahead as per DLS calculations and were awarded two points for the game.\n\nWashington Freedom have potentially the most fierce and balanced unit at their helm this tournament. Travis Head and Smith are in the form of their lives whereas Glenn Maxwell, Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar have also raised the standards.\n\nHence, it's safe to say that Washington Freedom will be the team to beat this MLC 2024 edition.\n\nSEA vs WAS: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSEA vs WAS: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at Grand Prairie Stadium has offered even assistance to both the batting and bowling departments. Bowlers who can maintain a good line and length and utilise the bounce effectively can trouble the batters. Spinners come into play as the pitch starts to wear down. Anything around 170-180 could be a match-winning total on the surface.\n\nSEA vs WAS: Probable Playing XIs\n\nSeattle Orcas: Quinton de Kock (wk), Ryan Rickelton, Heinrich Klaasen (c), Shubham Ranjane, Nauman Anwar, Imad Wasim, Hammad Azam, Harmeet Singh, Nandre Burger, Zaman Khan, Cameron Gannon\n\nWashington Freedom: Travis Head, Andries Gous (wk), Steven Smith (c), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Justin Dill, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nSEA vs WAS: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nSEA vs WAS: Winner Prediction\n\nConsidering the form and balance of both teams, this match is poised to be a close contest. Seattle Orcas will aim to find consistency, while Washington Freedom will be eager to maintain their winning streak. But overall, Freedom is likely to cross the finish line."

Smith departed for a quick 12 runs off 13 balls, leaving Freedom momentarily stunned.\n\nLooking ahead, Seattle Orcas will square off against San Francisco Unicorns on July 15, while Washington Freedom prepares to face Los Angeles Knight Riders on July 14 in upcoming Major League Cricket fixtures."

        "body": "Seattle Orcas (SEA) will clash against Washington Freedom (WAS) in Match 8 of the Major League Cricket (MLC 2024), at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, on July 12. Orcas are reeling in the bottom of the points table with one win in two games and a negative Net Run Rate of 1.172. On the other hand, Washington Freedom have the same stats but with an extra point and a positive NRR of 0.522 and sit in the second spot.\n\nWashington won their first game against Mumbai Indians New York by DLS method and four runs. Their next game against the Texas Super Kings was washed out due to rain and the upcoming game would define their course in the tournament. Talking about Orcas, they were handed a comprehensive defeat by MI New York by six wickets in the first game and followed by a heft defeat at the hands of Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nMatch Details\n\nPitch Report\n\nThe Dallas pitch favours batters throughout the game and the bowlers have to toil hard to get wickets. Spinners enjoy the bounce they get from the deck but the turn would be minimal. The weather will be partly cloudy and with less than a 10 percent chance of rain.\n\nHead-to-Head Record\n\nProbable Playing 11 for SEA vs WAS, Match 8\n\nSeattle Orcas:\n\nQuinton de Kock (wk), Nauman Anwar, Shehan Jayasuriya, Heinrich Klaasen, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Wasim, Michael Bracewell, Wayne Parnell (c), Harmeet Singh, Obed McCoy, Cameron Gannon\n\nWashington Freedom:\n\nJack Edwards, Andries Gous (wk), Mukhtar Ahmed, Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith (c), Obus Pienaar, Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen, Amilia Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nAlso Check: Fastest Balls in Cricket History\n\nProbable Top Performers from SEA vs WAS\n\nProbable Best Batter of the Match\n\nSteven Smith had an underwhelming T20I outing ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024. The batter was subsequently left out of the World Cup squad. But he seems to be in good touch in the ongoing MLC 2024, amassing 72 runs in two games and remaining unbeaten in both.\n\nAlso Check: MLC 2024 Most Runs\n\nProbable Best Bowler of the Match\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar proved his mettle in the T20 World Cup 2024 for the USA. He was a revelation for the minnows as he dismantled Pakistan's lineup. He has continued the same momentum in the MLC 2024, picking five wickets in two games at an average of 13.67."

After winning their opening game over Texas Super Kings, the Sunil Narine-led side is on a two-match losing streak, suffering defeats against Unicorns and Seattle Orcas, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, Corey Anderson-led side is just below Knight Riders and holds the fifth position in the points table. The side started their campaign on a high note, registering a six-wicket win over the same opponents. But in their previous game against Super Kings, the San Francisco-based franchise faced a batting collapse which eventually resulted in them ending on the losing side.\n\nMatch Details\n\nPitch Report\n\nThe surface at Morrisville appears to be consistent, maintaining its characteristics for the full 20-over game. However, a notable issue is the decreasing strike rate of batters in the second innings, as the ball loses pace off the surface. This allows bowlers to exploit the inconsistent bounce, suggesting teams should set moderate, achievable targets rather than aiming for exceptionally high scores. However, the team that wins the toss will look to bowl first.\n\nHead-to-Head Record\n\nProbable Playing 11 for LAS vs SF, Match 10\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine(C), Unmukt Chand (WK), Shakib Al Hasan, Nitish Kumar, David Miller, Andre Russell, Derone Davis, Corne Dry, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short, Josh Inglis(WK), Corey Anderson(C), Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Hassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nAlso Check:\n\nProbable Top Performers from LAS vs SF\n\nProbable Best Batter of the match:\n\nJason Roy could be the best batter in the upcoming match against the San Francisco-based franchise. The English opener who is not a regular member of the Three Lions has been featuring in most of the franchise-based leagues all around the world. For San Francisco, Roy has been exceptional with his bat and has scored 97 runs in three innings. With his form, he can trouble the opposition bowlers and take his team to a comfortable position single-handedly.\n\nProbable Best Bowler of the match:\n\nSpencer Johnson could be the best bowler in the forthcoming game. The left-arm pacer has been among the wickets since the first game and is currently the second-highest wicket-taker with six wickets under his name. With the pitch favouring more to the bowlers, Johnson will be a key player.\n\nToday’s Match Prediction: The team that bowls first to win the match\n\nScenario 1\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 40-50\n\nFirst Innings Score: 140-150\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders win the match\n\nScenario 2\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 30-40\n\nFirst Innings Score: 130-140\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns win the match"

Keep reading to find out the SEO vs WTF Match Prediction Match 8 Major League Cricket 2024.\n\nMatch Preview\n\nIn Match 6 of Major League Cricket, the Los Angeles Knight Riders batted first and set a competitive total of 168/5 in their allotted 20 overs. However, their efforts were overshadowed by a stellar performance from the Seattle Orcas, who chased down the target with ease, finishing at 169/1 in just 19.5 overs. This commanding display led to a resounding 9-wicket victory for the Orcas.\n\nRyan Rickelton played a pivotal role in Seattle’s triumph with an unbeaten 103 off 66 balls, showcasing his exceptional batting prowess. His innings included a mix of elegant strokes and powerful hitting, steering his team towards victory. Supporting him was Quinton de Kock, the wicketkeeper, who contributed a steady 51 not out off 46 deliveries, ensuring a strong partnership that sealed the game early for the Orcas. Nauman Anwar added a quickfire 9 runs from 7 balls, adding to the team’s total with valuable contributions down the order.\n\nOn the bowling front, Zaman Khan was instrumental for the Orcas, delivering an impressive spell to claim 2 wickets for just 24 runs in his 4 overs. His ability to strike crucial blows halted the Knight Riders’ momentum during their innings. Harmeet Singh also made significant contributions with the ball, taking 2 wickets for 34 runs in his allotted 4 overs, tightening the grip on Los Angeles’ batting lineup. Cameron Gannon chipped in with a crucial wicket, conceding 26 runs in his 4 overs, further bolstering the Orcas’ dominant performance.\n\nIn contrast, Match 5 saw the Washington Freedom making a strong start, reaching 62/0 in just 4 overs against the Texas Super Kings before rain interrupted play, leading to the match being abandoned. Travis Head was in exceptional form, smashing 32 runs off only 12 balls with aggressive strokeplay, setting a blistering pace early on. Captain Steven Smith provided steady support with 26 runs from 13 deliveries, ensuring Washington’s brisk start before weather conditions intervened.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar proved effective with the ball for the Texas Super Kings, picking up 2 crucial wickets for 33 runs in his 4 overs. His ability to break partnerships and control the run rate was crucial in restricting the Freedom’s scoring rate. Akeal Hosein and Justin Dill also contributed with a wicket each, with Hosein claiming 1 wicket for 32 runs in his 3 overs and Dill taking 1 wicket for 35 runs in his 3 overs, before rain ultimately brought a premature end to what promised to be an intriguing contest.\n\nTeam News\n\nSeattle Orcas Team News:\n\nSeattle Orcas showcased impressive performances throughout the tournament with no injury concerns.

        "date": "Thu Jul 11 08:32:23 2024",
        "body": "In a league match between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings in the 2024 Major League Cricket tournament, Mitchell Santner delivered a match-winning performance, punctuated by a monstrous 106-metre six that sealed the victory for his team.\n\nThe match, played at the Church Street Park in Morrisville, saw the Texas Super Kings chasing a challenging target of 128 runs set by the San Francisco Unicorns. With the game hanging in the favour of Texas, Santner stepped up to the crease in the 12th over, with his team needing 10 runs off 8.1 overs to secure the win.\n\nMitchell Santer, the baby-faced assassin\n\nAs the tension mounted, Santner faced a delivery from San Francisco’s Hassan Khan. What followed was a moment of sheer brilliance. Santner got under the tossed-up delivery outside off stump and unleashed a monstrous shot that sailed high and long, clearing the boundary by a considerable margin. The ball travelled an astonishing 106 metres, leaving the crowd in awe and the San Francisco fielders in disbelief.\n\n“That six from Santner was an absolute beast,” commented one of the commentators. “He just got under that delivery and sent it into the stratosphere. That’s the kind of shot that can turn a game on its head.”\n\nThe mammoth six brought the Texas Super Kings within touching distance of victory, with only 4 runs needed off the 8 overs remaining. Santner and his partner Milind Kumar made light work of the remaining runs, sealing a 7-wicket victory for their team.\n\nHere’s the video\n\nSkipper’s appreciation after the match\n\n“Santner’s six was the turning point of the match,” said the Texas Super Kings captain, Faf du Plessis. Faf also added in the post-match presentation that the experienced all-rounder is an asset to his team, and he expects the same from him every time he comes out on the ground.\n\nAlso WATCH: Quinton de Kock’s eye-catching reverse scoop shots during LAKR vs SEO game in MLC 2024\n\nHe stated, “It took the wind out of the Unicorns’ sails and gave us the momentum we needed to finish the job. That’s the kind of match-winning contribution we expect from our experienced players.”\n\nThe one-sided affair between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings once again showcased the Santner being an asset in T20 cricket, where the all-rounder’s brilliance with both bat and ball can turn the tide of the game. Santner’s monstrous six will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the highlights of the 2024 Major League Cricket season."

Ponting will be assisted by former Australian batter Cameron White.\n\nWhat went down for Washington Freedom in MLC 2023?\n\nWe finished third in the MLC 2023 standings with six points from three wins and two losses in our group games. In the resulting Eliminator contest against MI New York, we fell short by 16 runs.\n\nMatthew Short was our top run-getter in the 2023 campaign with 152 runs from six outings. Saurabh Netravalkar topped our bowling charts, ranking fifth overall with 10 wickets from six matches, including breathtaking figures of 6/9 against the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nMLC 2024 Schedule: Washington Freedom matches\n\nUnlike the five league matches, one against each team, which all teams had in MLC 2023, the current edition will see teams play a total of seven league matches. We will face MI New York and Texas Super Kings twice each and play once against the remaining three teams. Here's a look at our schedule for MLC 2024.\n\nWashington Freedom Matches at MLC 2024\n\nMLC 2024: Washington Freedom squad\n\nOur team has progressed well from last year and grown into a stronger unit in the second season. The batting group has a wealth of experience, especially with the Australian trio of Head, Maxwell, and Smith.\n\nMukhtar Ahmed is a dangerous batter at the top of the order, averaging 28.77 in T20s with a healthy strike rate of 146.18.\n\nLahiru Milantha is the second wicketkeeper in the squad, along with Andries Gous. The left-handed Milantha is also a useful batter, averaging just under 25 with a strike rate of 136.58.\n\nGlenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, Marco Jansen, and Ian Holland are the all-rounders who provide the much-needed balance to the side. Holland averages 27.55 with the bat in T20s, and his handy medium pace provides a breakthrough every 22.6 balls.\n\nNetravalkar and Ferguson spearhead a pace attack that includes the experienced Andrew Tye. Tye has a tally of 332 wickets from 239 matches at an average of 21.15 and an unbelievable strike rate of 15.4.\n\nAkeal Hosein will headline the spin department. He will be the fourth left-arm spinner in the side, along with Ravindra, Obus Pienaar, and Amila Aponso.\n\nWashington Freedom Squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy Bodugum, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs MINY MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nThe LIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs MI New York match will be available on Monumental Sports Network in Washington D.C. and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA.

        "body": "Lockie Ferguson's splendid spell with the ball powered Washington Freedom to a five-wicket win against Seattle Orcas in their Major League Cricket 2024 match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday.\n\nPlayer of the Match, Ferguson registered match-winning figures of 4/26 in four overs to skittle out SO for 124, while Saurabh Netravalkar also impressed, picking up three wickets. SO skipper Heinrich Klaasen top-scored in the contest with 51 off 30 balls.\n\nIn response, Lahiru Milantha played a sensible innings to anchor our chase with an unbeaten 30-ball 33, as we reached 127/5 with more than an over remaining. Obus Pienaar also chipped in with an unbeaten 31 off 30 balls.\n\nNetravalkar justified skipper Steve Smith’s decision to bowl first by striking in his first over. Ferguson picked up a wicket in the powerplay, as SO managed 35/2 after the first six overs, with only 16 runs coming from boundaries.\n\nWe kept things tight even after the powerplay with Ferguson knocking Quinton de Kock for his second wicket of the match. Smith was in action as he ran out Shubham Ranjane with an excellent fielding effort to break a crucial partnership.\n\nMarco Jansen dismissed dangerman Heinrich Klaasen, who had just reached his half-century and looked in fine touch. Ferguson returned for a double strike in his final over to end his spell with four scalps and Seattle Orcas were all-out with two balls to spare.\n\nNetravalkar rose to the top of the bowling charts of MLC 2024, picking up his eighth wicket of the tournament. The left-arm pacer finished with an incisive spell of 3/18.\n\nChasing 125, Rachin Ravindra, playing his first match in the MLC, got us off to a quick start, hitting 26 off just 16 balls, which included two sixes and three fours. We reached 47 for the loss of three wickets at the end of the powerplay.\n\nFrom 64/5, Milantha and Pienaar put their heads down to build a crucial partnership to wrest the initiative back from SO. Their unbroken sixth-wicket partnership of 63 runs from 55 balls helped us cross the line as we remained the only team to be unbeaten in the MLC this year.\n\nWith the win, we moved to the top of the MLC 2024 points table with five points from three matches.\n\nWe will meet the Los Angeles Knight Riders in our next match at Church Street Park in Morrisville on Sunday.\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom MLC 2024 brief scores: SO 124 in 19.4 overs (Heinrich Klaasen 51, Quinton de Kock 24, Lockie Ferguson 4/26, Saurabh Netravalkar 3/18) vs WF 127/5 in 18.2 overs (Lahiru Milantha 33*, Obus Pienaar 31*, Nandre Burger 2/27, Harmeet Singh 1/15)\n\nWashington Freedom won by five wickets."
