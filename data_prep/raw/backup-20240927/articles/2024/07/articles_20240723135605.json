        "date": "Mon Jul 22 17:22:59 2024",
        "body": "Programming note: The San Francisco Unicorns-Washington Freedom match airs Monday at 5:30 p.m. PT on NBC Sports Bay Area Plus.\n\nCricket is one of the most popular global sports, but in the US, it is just starting to gain national attention.\n\nThe recently completed T20 World Cup featured matches in Texas, New York and Florida, and Major League Cricket -- with the San Francisco Unicorns as one of its inaugural six teams -- is about to wrap up its second season.\n\nAll-rounder Corey Anderson is at the center of both events.\n\nThe 33-year-old New Zealand native moved to the US in 2020 and joined Team USA to help spearhead the growth of cricket in the country.\n\nAnderson, the Unicorns' captain, helped Team USA stun Pakistan in World Cup group play in one of the biggest upsets in all of sports in recent memory.\n\nNow Anderson and the Unicorns (four wins, one loss, one no-result) are vying to win the Major League Cricket championship. They finish their regular-season schedule against the Washington Freedom on Monday night.\n\nNews\n\nThe Unicorns and Freedom will meet again Thursday in the MLC Qualifier. The winner advances to the Final.\n\nMI New York and the Texas Super Kings meet in the Eliminator match. The loser is done, but the winner advances to the Challenger, where they will take on the loser of the Unicorns-Freedom Qualifier.\n\nThe winner of the challenger heads to the Final, which takes place Sunday in Grand Prairie, Texas -- the venue for a majority of MLC's matches. Others are being played in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nSo there is a real chance the Unicorns and Freedom could play three consecutive times in a six-day span.\n\nAhead of the Unicorns' match on Monday, Anderson spoke with NBC Sports Bay Area about his journey to the US, growing the sport in the country, his experience in the World Cup, the Unicorns signing Australian National Team captain Pat Cummins and cricket returning to the Olympics in 2028.\n\n[Editor's note: This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity]\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area: “You're a native New Zealander. You spent about eight years representing that country, but you retired from that team back in 2020. And you moved here. And you now represent the U.S. Give new fans of cricket a brief overview of your professional career and what went into your decision to leave New Zealand and come to the U.S.”\n\nCorey Anderson: “I played for New Zealand, as you said, for give-or-take about eight years and a few injuries through then, so it was probably a little bit off and on. But yeah, played in multiple World Cups with New Zealand and it was the dream when I was a kid to play for the Black Caps and then in COVID 2020. I came across to the States and my wife is from Dallas, so that was the big reason for moving across. And saw an opportunity with the major league and thought, ‘Everyone's always been wanting America to grow with cricket and it's always been something that everyone's been really intrigued with.’ And I thought, ‘What better than getting in there on the ground level and trying to help this thing grow?’\n\n“I've been here for a period of time now and I mean, it's been great. To play for the US in the World Cup was unbelievable and extremely exciting. I didn't think my career would quite take that path or that journey. But it's exciting.”\n\nNBCSBA: “When did the possibility of playing for Major League Cricket first pop up for you and what about that appealed to you?”\n\nAnderson: “I think having a new competition – there’s so many of them jumping up. But like I said before, I think America being a pretty untapped market in terms of cricket. It just had so much interest to it. And I've always loved the States and I love American sports, and I think there was just something about it that kind of attracted me to it and I think it was an opportunity that was too hard to pass up on.\n\n“Just the growth and being able to kind of try and get your fingerprints on a new sport in America and help it grow, I think was the most exciting part. So that said, a lot of hoops to jump through and a lot of hurdles to get over. But yeah, it's getting there.”\n\nNBCSBA: “What has your experience been like so far in the first two years of actual gameplay for Major League cricket?\n\nAnderson: “It's been fantastic. We're really lucky here that the grounds that we do have are at a really high quality and the overseas players that we have bought across, as well as some of the best in the world, some of the best that are going around the T20 circuit. In terms of a fan of the game, being able to watch that and get eyes on, again, the biggest players in the world. Pretty cool to have that at your own back doorstep.\n\n“It's taken a heap attraction and there's been so many eyes on it. It's very early in the journey for it, but yeah, being the second season now, it's gone up and up and up and you know, hopefully, it continues on that trend.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Do you expect in future seasons, the seasons, to get longer as you guys gain more traction?”\n\nAnderson: “Yeah, I would imagine so. I don't think to a to a huge degree. I think scheduling around other competitions is still something that's a continual work on for every competition. But yeah, I could see this progressing out to playing a home and away game, you know, 10 games in a season, then the playoffs. But again, that's probably the infrastructure part is the big issue.\n\n“That's an ongoing thing. That's probably the biggest piece to the puzzle that needs to get sorted. And that stuff takes time to get through city planning and trying to find land for that. Unfortunately, cricket's not the makeshift baseball stadium or football stadium. So we can’t kind of just move it to one place and pack it up in the next.\n\n“So you've got to basically grow these things from the ground up or renovate existing stadiums. They can have the room to do it. There's a lot more moving pieces to try and grow that. But it has started in a lot of other places in the home. Places like San Francisco as well have started those conversations and trying to start those contracts and the construction of those stadiums.”\n\nNBCSBA: “I believe I've heard that Santa Clara County is trying to get a stadium or they're trying to build a stadium in Santa Clara County just south of San Francisco. Have you been to San Francisco? Have you been to the Bay Area? What do you know about the Bay Area?”\n\nAnderson: “I don't know the Bay Area really well, but I've been there a few times now. We normally have a little bit of a preseason when we go in and I think we've been great in terms of trying to have fan activation and try to grow the brand itself as well. And I think we're probably one of the only times that's actually doing that and getting out to say our hands [are] dirty into the environment and try and actually get our fan base and grow it so when we do have a stadium that we can play it in the home ground, we've got a fan base that will happily turn up and make sure that we can fill out a stadium. I think we've done a great job toward that. And I know that the marketing group on the staff at the uniforms have done a tremendous job.”\n\nNBCSBA: \"You have played in the [Indian Premier League] and you've played in the Big Bash [in Australia]. Those are established leagues around the world. How far is Major League Cricket from reaching that level and what needs to be done to get there?”\n\nAnderson: “The IPL is probably the pinnacle of all sports in terms cricket for the franchises, but Major League [Cricket has] got the potential to compete with it.\n\n“I think if you look at the broadcasting landscape in America, it's one of the biggest sports broadcasting countries in the world. And again, it's just been so untapped and underdeveloped, particularly with cricket here in this country. If we can grow it on that level and attract, I guess, more Americans to watch the game and get involved with it, that's more of a long-term play.\n\n“But it has such a big upside to it. And I think that's why people have been so excited about it, is it's just got so much room to grow. And considering cricket's second biggest pool in the world and I know it's very much dominated by the South Asian culture, but there's no reason why Americans can't love it and get around it and make it their own as well, right?”\n\nNBCSBA: “Is the key to success for cricket and Major League Cricket in the US appealing to people that already follow cricket in this country? Or is it appealing to new fans who don't know much about cricket and getting them to understand and buy into the sport?”\n\nAnderson: “I think it's a combination. That it's trying to find a happy medium, I guess pleasing the masses of the ones who already are the diehard cricket lovers. And so we're going to turn up to the games and I think obviously we always appreciate the support, but I think trying to grow this into America is trying to grab that local fan base and say, ‘Hey, this is a new game. It's an exciting game. If you're intrigued by it, come down, watch it, learn it.’ And I think over the last couple of months as well, especially with the [T20] World Cup, there was a lot of coverage around that and a lot of people, a lot of media outlets who normally don't discuss cricket started talking about cricket, which is fantastic for the game in general.\n\n“But again, there's the thirst for it and we just need to make sure we can kind of keep applying that when we can. And yeah, I think it's got so much room to grow. It's exciting. It's an exciting time to be involved in cricket in America.\n\nNBCSBA: “You were part of the Team USA win over Pakistan [in the T20 World Cup], which was a massive upset. I was in New York at the time and I got alerts from national media, American media, that normally don't send alerts about cricket. But that was a big, big deal. That was talked about everywhere. What was it like being part of that and just that kind of an upset?”\n\nAnderson: “It's pretty surreal. I mean, USA Cricket in terms of I guess our fan base itself is we're kind of basically unknown to a degree. I think a lot of Americans didn't realize we even had a cricket team. So we were obviously massive underdogs in terms of trying to go up against these big nations. And I think the beauty of it as well as I've been on the other side of it, where I've played for one of the top eight nations in the world, and you're always a chance at winning and you're always trying to strike winning that trophy.\n\n“And I think being on the other side now, it's funny because I know that can scare teams when you're a little team because you can ruin someone's day and ruin someone's World Cup. I think the outlook we had was, yes, we were underdogs, but let's lean into that and kind of create a little bit of carnage.\n\n“And if we can catch people on the hop a little bit and have them vulnerable and we end up having a good day, then I know we've got the talent to be able to do it. And I think we saw that against Pakistan. You tend to find against those big teams, the big teams might crumble and just have a really bad day and they end up losing the game instead of the other team winning.\n\n“But I think in that regard, when we played Pakistan, we genuinely beat them. We actually won. We played really good cricket from Ball One all the way through. Ideally, it wouldn't have gone [to a] Super Over. We probably dragged that out a little bit too much, but we still did the job and I think for 95 percent of that game we were in control.\n\n“And I think that shows people the talent that we do have that we can compete against some of the biggest players in the world. And that was a huge confidence booster, not only for the guys themselves, but I think just the landscape of cricket in America to understand that yes, we can compete and we can perform against these big teams and it shows people that there is the hype that's been drawn in the last two or three years around Major League Cricket and trying to grow it kind of gives a bit of an answer to say this is why these things are in place and this is where we can get to and this is why we need to continue to play high levels of cricket against the best teams in the world. Because we can compete, we can get better, and the only way is up. The sky's the limit in where we can actually go to. And I know there's a lot of local talent, a lot of young kids who are really good at cricket, but unfortunately there's never really been a pathway for them to continue playing the game.\n\n“So with Major League Cricket and Minor League Cricket, we can now say to the younger generation, there's a career for you here if you want it, and if you want to keep pursuing it and you love this game, it's all in front of you. And I think now that's a good time to get into cricket because it's just going to get bigger and bigger.\"\n\nNBCSBA: “It sets the stage for future World Cups, for Team USA in future World Cups. But also Cricket is returning to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles. Do you hope to play for Team USA in four years and how do you see that stage helping cricket grow in the US?\"\n\nAnderson: “I think in four more years’ time, it’s hard to know what's going to happen in four years' time. I moved here four years ago and a lot's happened in that space of time. So, look, I think that I'm extremely excited to be able to potentially have the opportunity to be involved in another World Cup and also an Olympics. I think the great thing as well is that USA cricket's generally never had more than kind of 12 months in front of them where they could plan and they know what they're doing and schedule and things like that.\n\n“We've now got a four-year cycle here where in two years’ time there's another T20 World Cup to try and prepare for. Post that another two years after that there is an Olympics and it's on our shores. And I think that's just such an exciting prospect to say not only to the cricketers themselves, but to sponsors anyone who wants to get involved with USA cricket is a four-year cycle here, which is a huge time to get involved. And the upside is massive, obviously, because you're now on the biggest stage and we've shown that we can compete on the biggest stage.\n\n“And again, the USA always has this wonderful thing of any time they plan an event, regardless of what sport it is or what league it is, eyes are always tuned to the US because again, that one of the most powerful countries in the world and in terms of sport, they love sports and I think they love an underdog and they love a winner.\n\n“And I think when we started taking the blocks on both of those during the World Cup, we obviously didn't win it entirely. But I think we probably arguably won people's hearts over during that process. And I think that kind of goes a long way to it as well.”\n\nNBCSBA: “You definitely got people's attention in this country. I had coworkers who don't watch cricket who saw that and were like, ‘Were you there for that match? I'm like, “No, I was in New York, not in Dallas,’ but that's the attention that kind of upset got. It was people that don't normally watch it are talking about it. So that's kind of the goal, right? Is to win the matches and get people's attention.\"\n\nAnderson: “And that's the thing. And there's going to be so many different ways to try and attract people to the game. It can't always just be the one side, but it's got to be so, so many different angles and so many different ways to try and get people to get involved in this game and understand it and learn it and love it. And that's just one of those places I think everyone loves when they're in love, loves a story and a narrative behind that and I think we've created that and we just need to continue to keep growing that as well.\n\n“And it's exciting for people to kind of know that they got an early on the journey and can see it start to flourish and see where it gets to over a period of time. We will also take bandwagon fans as well if we get to a point of that as well. But I think it's just exciting to obviously be involved with it and get to the point where we're at the moment.\n\n“I think the guys have made such huge sacrifices to be here and I think that probably gets missed a little bit. I know a lot of the guys aren’t originally born in the US and have got very different stories around how they got here. And I’ve heard multiple times just through other sources in terms media that it a bit of an artificial team. I think the guys take offense to that in a way because we’ve sacrificed a lot to be in this situation and moving countries and uprooting your life is not easy. And the guys worked very, very hard to get where they are. I know when we put on the USA jersey, we’re extremely proud to play for it.\n\n“And I think that was the big thing we discussed during the World Cup. Yes, we’re not the favorite. We’re not expected to win. We’re not even expected to through to the top eight. But if we lose every game, results are results and you can’t really do anything about the outcome. But we wanted to make sure we made USA proud of the cricket team and there’s so many ways you can do that, whether its chasing a ball to boundary, keep fighting to the very end regardless of how it looks. And I think we did that for the majority of the tournament and that’s what people loved the most about it. I think our attitude towards our, I guess, our moral compass of why and how we’re playing for the US is fantastic. Hopefully we can just shepherd the next generation into that USA team and continue to grow.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Has there been any talk of like Team USA doing tours of [countries] like India or Pakistan or Australia, New Zealand or South Africa or any of the big eight countries?\n\nAnderson: “I think I think that's something that the ICC is always going to have to be the one who does the scheduling and figure out those future tours. But I think again, there’s a need and a want. We obviously would love to do it because it increases the value of what we are doing and the talent that we have that’ll keep producing cricketers here and being able to know that they can play against these players. But I think sometimes it doesn't always match up with those schedulings..\n\n“And I know that teams would love to come across to the States and again, in time, I think when we have more infrastructure that's going to be more and more feasible. But yeah, I think if it's teams wanting to do almost like a mini-tour before they go to another nation, like a warm-up series or something like that, I think at that moment where we're not going to be extremely picky around who wants to do it, they come to our shores and I think that's the exciting thing.\n\n“I think they know now that when they play the USA, we can compete and they can get some really good cricket and be tested as well. So that probably hasn't happened in the past. So that's probably changed the narrative around who we can potentially play in and when we potentially play them. So that's extremely exciting.”\n\nNBCSBA: “[The Unicorns] recently added Australian National Team captain Pat Cummins. What has it been like having him on somebody of his stature on the roster?”\n\nAnderson: “It's huge. I mean, any time you bring in one of the best players in the world, it's going to lift the team and they're going to be extremely excited to play alongside him. And [I’ve been] lucky enough to play with Pat a handful of times during the IPL and he's a great human being as well.\n\n“Sometimes the biggest players in the world, sometimes it goes the other way when they get into a changing room. But the amount of knowledge that [he] has and what he's willing to give to guys, to help them. I think he's also saying this is an opportunity to help grow the game and it's an exciting prospect.\n\n“And kudos to him as well. He’s had hardly any time over the last six months, basically, and for him to want to be involved with the Unicorns is huge. It's not only for the players to be able to have him involved and the fans, but just the marketing aspect of having Pat involved in groups.\n\n“I know he's helped me tremendously in terms of captaining the side, calling on him to be a bit of a sounding board when I'm out there in the middle as well. It's been so valuable. He's a great guy to have in the group and I'm glad he's here long-term as well.\"\n\nNBCSBA: “I know he signed a four-year contract so … he made a sizable commitment to playing in Major League Cricket, playing for the Unicorns like that. That has to feel good that somebody of his stature is willing to make that kind of commitment. [He’s going to] come here every year for the next couple of years, right?\"\n\nAnderson: “Massively. I think it's smart for his side. And I think smart from the Unicorn side as well. I think you want to you want to get the best players in the world and you want to try and have as long as you possibly can. So yeah, I think that's a win-win for both camps and I know I'm extremely excited to have him in the group for a lot longer.\n\n“Hopefully we can continue to have a similar group going forward as well. I know franchise cricket tends to change very quickly and scheduling and availability always seems to be an issue that comes up. But the group at the moment is fantastic and I know we're winning and it makes things a little bit easier as well.\n\n“But regardless of that, that's been a great group to be around. And yeah, hopefully, we can kind of stick together and keep continuing to grow our culture as well.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Pat was quoted in a story recently that he said your presence, along with Coach Shane Watson, played a part in his decision to play in Major League Cricket. What does it mean to you to have that kind of impact on your peers?”\n\nAnderson: “Yes, that's great. I think you can try and get guys who enjoy playing alongside you or things like that. That's obviously such a big, big one in terms of feeling proud about what you're doing. But again, I think when you look at cricket as a whole and you look at the guys that you play alongside when you're out there in the field and your batting and bowling and fielding that, that's obviously from what people see is a big part of the game.\n\n“Obviously it's how you win games and it's how you go about your stuff. But I think the human element of it being off the field and understanding that when you've got a team that you get along with and guys gel well together, you can go and have a drink question or a coffee or whatever it might be, that makes such a huge difference in the performance part as well.\n\n“Like I said before, Pat's just a great human being and there's probably not so many better guys to have involved in this group. It's extremely exciting to have him and it's nice of him to say those kind words.”\n\nNBCSBA: “You guys play Washington [on Monday] and then you play them again in a Qualifier. You could potentially play them a third straight time in the [Major League Cricket] Final. How do you see your squad matching up with Washington? And then when you're preparing for a match like that and you know you're going to see them again potentially two more times, do you potentially hold anything back in [Monday’s] match so that you don't give them anything to look out for the following matches or do you play it straight up?”\n\nAnderson: “Good question. I mean, it's probably a little bit more of a unique situation because, like you said, yeah, we could be looking at playing them three times in a row. That's in a perfect world. That would be nice if that's the case, because it would mean we’re through to the Final. But that being said, yeah, tonight's an interesting one.\n\n“We've had a few niggles in the camp regarding some injuries and things like that, so we've just got to be cautious. Obviously moving forward. It's always nice to know that you're already in that 1 and 2 spot and playing in the Finals with another life. But I think momentum and cricket's such a massive thing and I think most sports would probably say the same thing that you want to get your straps and you kind of want to keep going and when things are thinking, you get yourself in those situations, more than not, you start understanding how you need to win and it'll change from game to game.\n\n“But I don't think you want to take the foot off the throat or foot off the gas. I think, yeah, you still got to put your best foot forward and try and play the best cricket you can. And yeah, there might be some tactics around something slightly different. But again, I think the talent that we've got on our side is it's obviously extremely exciting. “And hopefully tonight, [it] goes similar way to what has been as well and guys can do their job and we can still get a win. Yeah nice to know we're through the Finals. Still got work to do.\""

        "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nThe final group fixture of Major League Cricket in 2024 has little at stake in regards to the table with Texas Super Kings already assured of a place in the eliminator, whilst Seattle Orcas are eliminated from contention\n\nDATE & TIME: Tuesday 23rd July 2024 - USA ET – 8:30pm / USA PT – 5:30pm / West Indies – 7:30pm / Wednesday 24th July 2024 - UK – 1:30am / South Africa – 2:30am / Pakistan - 5:30am / India – 6:00am / Bangladesh – 6:30am / Australia – 10:30am\n\nVENUE: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, Texas, United States\n\nWEATHER: Sunshine at the start of play, descending into clear skies with light winds and temperatures between 27-29c.\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – Sony Sports / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – TBA\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – discovery+ / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – Sony LIV / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia & New Zealand – Amazon Prime Video\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: GETTING BACK TO WINNING WAYS A PRORITY\n\nAlthough Texas Super Kings are already secure in the play-offs and guarantees to face MI New York in the eliminator, they need to generate some momentum and won’t want to come into that match following back-to-back defeats after being beaten by 42 runs last time out by Washington Freedom.\n\nLAST THREE: LWA\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS FORM: WANTING TO AT LEAST FINISH ON A HIGH\n\nIt’s been a tournament to forget for Seattle Orcas, who have won just one of their six group games played despite being the only team not to suffer a washout. They come into this final match having lost each of their last four, most recently going down by six wickets to San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nLAST THREE: LLL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIt’s key to wait until the respective line-ups are announced before making any investments here. As this match has nothing at stake, both teams, particularly Texas Super Kings with a crunch eliminator on the horizon could choose to give their key players a rest. Captain Faf du Plessis should play though and remains top of the run-scoring table in Major League Cricket this season with 264 runs to his name so far. Back him to accumulate another 20+ runs here.\n\nMarcus Stoinis’ big-hitting exploits are not to be ignored as his brute power makes him a prime candidate for investment via the relevant betting markets available. Explore backing the Australian all-rounder to strike the most sixes across this encounter for Texas Super Kings.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWe mentioned Faf du Plessis and his position at the top of the run-scoring charts. Trailing just behind him is Ryan Rickelton, with 225 runs under his belt, including a top score of 103 not out. His personal ambition would likely be to try and overhaul his fellow South African, so backing him to score a fifty in this match may prove a smart move.\n\nWe’ve touched upon the bowling skills of domestic player Harmeet Singh previously and it’s these USA stars who arguably have the most to prove as we edge towards the latter end of this tournament. Harmeet no doubt wants to show that he is worthy of franchise gigs in other competitions down the line by adding to his eight wickets gained across this tournament. Back Harmeet to finish as Seattle’s top bowler here.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS VS SEATTLE ORCAS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nAs much as the Seattle Orcas management will want a win over the Super Kings to end their tournament, the reality is that most of their squad are likely to have their minds elsewhere at this point, specifically on their next cricketing assignment whether it be a franchise gig or international commitments.\n\nMotivation is higher for Texas Super Kings, knowing that two straight losses going into the play-offs would not bode well for them. Add that to home advantage being in their favour and the expectation is that Texas will gain the victory, even if they were to rotate their team."

        "body": "Right then, that will be it from us for this contest. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. The action continues at the Major League Cricket, 2024. The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the Seattle Orcas in Match 21 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas. It will be another dead rubber as the four teams for the playoffs are already locked in. That game will be played on July 24th and will start at 6.00 am IST (12.30 am GMT). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nThe skipper of San Francisco Unicorns, Corey Anderson is up for a chat. He says that they had seen glimpses of Sanjay Krishnamurthi before and he feels proud of how Sanjay performed today. Adds that he is only 20 and he has got such maturity. Says that he will be a big player for them in their following games. Mentions that Hassan Khan is a key player for them as well and ends by saying that they can rely on him at any part of their innings.\n\nSteve Smith, the Washington Freedom skipper says that they played nicely and had a good score on board. Adds that it was a reasonable chase and the Unicorns batted well. Shares that they wanted to take the game on Travis Head has been exceptional. Mentions that today he got off to a fast start and Travis Head played as a second fiddle. Ends by lauding the Unicorn batters sharing that it got challenging with the wet outfield but plenty to learn in the rain-reduced game.\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his sensational knock. He says that he decided to go hard from the beginning. Adds that he wanted to take his chances and it came off today. Shares that he worked on the mental side, and that helped him to play freely. Mentions that it was not turning much for the left-arm spinners, so he was trying to keep a calm head in the middle and it paid off.\n\nJosh Inglis is in for a chat. He says that he is happy with the win. Says that he would have liked to stay till the end but the boys did a fantastic job. Adds that this will give them confidence in the qualifiers and this win was needed. Ends by saying that it was an outstanding innings from Sanjay Krishnamurthi and this is a good confidence booster for him.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Washington Freedom batted first and made 174 in 15.3 overs before the innings was shortened by rain. Both Travis Head and Steven Smith scored outstanding fifties while Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra played handy cameos. Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan were the pick of the bowlers for the Unicorns on a run fest day in Dallas. This win gets the San Francisco Unicorns on par with the Washington Freedom on the points table but they will finish second as the Freedom have a superior net run rate.\n\nWashington Freedom started well with the ball but failed to keep it tight through the middle and the latter over. Akeal Hosein got the early wicket of Finn Allen while Andrew Tye got three for 41. All the bowlers, except Rachin Ravindra went for over 12 runs to the over and it was absolute carnage. Washington Freedom did rest quite a few of their first-choice bowlers but wouldn't have thought to lose after setting a huge score. They will want to take the learnings from this game before they meet the Unicorns again in Qualifer 1.\n\nAn extraordinary run chase from the San Francisco Unicorns sees them defeat the Washington Freedom by 6 wickets with just 2 balls to spare. The Unicorns needed 177 to win off the 14 overs as per the DLS Method and they have done it in some style. Chasing the score, the openers departed early but Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis smoked it all around the park and added 77 runs in just 5 overs. Inglis made a quick-fire 45 off 17 while Hassan Khan chipped in with an unbeaten cameo of 32 off 11. The star of the chase was Sanjay Krishnamurthi who made a brilliant 79 off just 42 and took his team over the line. With this win, San Francisco Unicorns become the first side to defeat the Washington Freedom this season.\n\n4\n\nOvers12.6\n\nScore174 - 4\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar to Hassan Khan, FOUR! Make that three in a row! Full toss, outside off. Hassan Khan swings hard again and gets another outside edge that runs to the deep third region for a hat-trick of boundaries. San Francisco Unicorns just need three off the final over.\n\n6\n\nOvers11.5\n\nScore154 - 4\n\nAndrew Tye to Sanjay Krishnamurthi, SIX! THUMPED! Slower and fuller in the slot. Sanjay Krishnamurthi picks it early and hammers it over the deep square leg boundary for half a dozen. Sanjay Krishnamurthi is playing a gem of a knock here. The equation is now 23 off 13 balls.\n\nW\n\nOvers9.6\n\nScore122 - 4\n\nAndrew Tye to Sherfane Rutherford, OUT! STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR AND TAKEN! Tye gets two in the over! Goes short of a length, around off. Sherfane Rutherford miscues the pull and goes straight up in the air. Andrew Tye goes to his right and takes a good catch off his bowling. Sherfane Rutherford departs for a second ball duck. San Francisco Unicorns are four down.\n\nW\n\nOvers9.4\n\nScore122 - 3\n\nAndrew Tye to Josh Inglis, OUT! CAUGHT! Josh Inglis is gone! Andrew Tye and Washington Freedom will be relieved. Low full toss, outside off. Josh Inglis flays it toward the deep backward point region. Mukhtar Ahmed runs to his left and takes a sharp running catch. The cameo of 45 off 17 from Josh Inglis comes to an end.

Fuller than a good length, outside off. Josh Inglis brings out the reverse ramp and connects it brilliantly to clear the deep third fence for a maximum.\n\n6\n\nOvers8.1\n\nScore90 - 2\n\nJack Edwards to Sanjay Krishnamurthi, SIX! SMOKED WITH AUTHORITY! Back of a length, outside off. Sanjay Krishnamurthi drags it from outside off and clubs it over the long on fence for half a dozen."

        "body": "On Monday, July 22, in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 20th match, USA batter Sanjay Krishnamurthi stole the show. San Francisco's captain, Corey Anderson, won the toss and asked the Washington Freedom to bat first, who concluded their innings at 174/3 in 15.3 before the rain halted the play.\n\nCaptain Steven Smith (56 off 31 balls) and opener Travis Head (56 off 36 balls) struck fifties for Washington.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns were given the revised target of 177 in 14 overs. The Unicorns lost opener Finn Allen on the first ball.

When Sanjay got fascinated with cricket after seeing the 2011 World Cup with his dad, his family decided to relocate to their native of Bangalore.\n\nIn a conversation with Cricbuzz, Sanjay's father Satya Krishnamurthi said:\n\n“Fortunately, I was able to spend a lot of time with him after our move over there and focus on cricket. We built cricket nets with a bowling machine for Sanjay in our backyard.”\n\n#2 He was selected in the Spin Star talent hunt launched by Anil Kumble when he was 11\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi initially started his career as a left-arm spinner. In 2022, during a conversation with the SIX Cricket Community, he said:\n\n“At 11, I was selected in the Anil Kumble spin-star talent hunt. I was selected in the top 20.”\n\n#3 Sanjay decided to focus more on batting after scoring runs in School cricket\n\nIn an interview with SIX Cricket Community, he discussed the transition from spinner to batter:\n\n“In my last year of under 16, I scored a lot of runs, opening the batting for my school team, and then decided to focus more on batting that year.”\n\nIn the highly competitive Bangalore schools' cricket league, Sanjay went on to score more than 500 runs in six games. As a result, he was chosen for the Karnataka State Cricket Association U-16 team.\n\n#4 He came back to Houston in 2020\n\nSanjay came to Houston at the start of 2020 to participate in a USA Cricket training camp. From then on, he has concentrated on his US cricket career. After the players' draft, Sanjay was selected for the Minor League Cricket competition in the United States in June 2021.\n\n#5 The right-handed batter made his international debut in 2021\n\nSanjay made his international debut against Nepal in 2021. He has played three ODI matches in his career and only managed to score 13 runs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi has shown his class in the MLC and will be looking to score some runs for his nation if he gets the opportunity in the future."

They confirmed their place in the Qualifier 1 with a 6-wicket win over bottom-placed Seattle Orcas on Saturday. Left arm-spinner Hassan Khan who was bought as a seventh bowler delivered well, picking up 3 wickets in his 2 overs and speedster Carmi le Roux’s 2-fer helped them to keep the Orcas for 152 for 7.\n\nFinn Allen showed his destruction, single-handedly turning the game towards the Unicorns with a blazing 77 runs from just 30 balls.

        "body": "The final league fixture of the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) will witness the Texas Super Kings (TSK) take on the Seattle Orcas (SOR). The contest is a dead rubber to a degree with TSK having sealed a place in the Eliminator clash, while SOR have also officially finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nDespite their fate being sealed, both sides would love to end the league stage on a high. TSK will look for some momentum ahead of the high-octane Eliminator clash against the MI New York, especially having lost to the Washington Freedom by a significant margin.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas, on the other hand, have to play for their pride. Following a successful maiden season in 2023 where they finished as runner-ups, the franchise could only compile a single win this time around and are currently on a four-game losing streak.\n\nEven though it has not been a very memorable season for both sides, particularly the Seattle Orcas, there have been some standout individual performers from both sides. On that note, let us take a look at a combined Texas Super Kings-Seattle Orcas playing 11 for MLC 2024.\n\nTop order: Faf du Plessis, Ryan Rickleton, and Quinton de Kock\n\nTSK skipper Faf du Plessis is the leading scorer of the tournament so far with 264 runs in five matches at a strike rate of 166.03. He recorded a stunning hundred against the Washington Freedom and has scored consecutive fifties in his last two appearances against the MI New York and the reverse fixture against the Washington Freedom.\n\nAfter a prolific SA20 2024 campaign where he ended up as the leading run scorer, Rickleton has carried the same form into the MLC as well. He was part of the South Africa squad that finished runner-ups in the 2024 T20 World Cup but failed to avail a single chance in the playing XI. In the ongoing season, he has accumulated 225 runs in five innings at a strike rate of 149.\n\nQuinton de Kock has donned the role at No.3 with the Seattle Orcas, and he has done a decent job of it. The left-handed wicket-keeper batter has scored 144 runs in six outings at a strike rate of 123.07.\n\nMiddle Order: Heinrich Klaasen, Marcus Stoinis, and Calvin Savage\n\nThe Seattle Orcas skipper had memorable IPL and T20 World Cup campaigns, despite ending up as runner-ups in both. However, his momentum seems to have run its course for the momentum as he had a mediocre MLC 2024 season. He has only scored 93 runs in six matches, including one fifty. However, he still remains one of the best batters in the format, and remains a threat for the opposition.\n\nStoinis came into the MLC on the back of a brilliant 2024 T20 World Cup for Australia. The all-rounder has been decent with the bat and expensive with the ball but has been among the wickets in a very short time.\n\nCalvin Savage has been a handy player for TSK in the lower middle order. He has scored 75 runs in four innings at a strike rate of 153, including a quick-fire 35 in TSK's most recent outing.\n\nLower Order: Imad Wasim, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Gannon, Zia-ul-Haq, and Harmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon is among the leading wicket-takers in the tournament with 10 wickets in six matches. The pacer is the joint second-highest wicket-taker along with Rashid Khan. Although his economy is a bit on the higher side, he is an able spearhead to the bowling attack.\n\nThe TSK pace bowling duo of Dwayne Bravo and Zia-ul-Haq are valuable additions to the attack to bring balance and variety. Zia-ul-Haq is the joint-highest wicket-taker for TSK with six scalps. while the veteran Bravo has picked up four wickets in four matches, with an economy of 8.36 while bowling the tough overs.\n\nThe spin attack of Imad Wasim and Harmeet Singh has been difficult for the batters to deal with considering their varied skill set. The left-arm finger spinners have picked up a combined total of 12 wickets, with their average economy reading just 7.10."

        "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 is now just two games away from the knockout stages. San Francisco Unicorns are up against Washington Freedom in an important clash on Tuesday, July 23.\n\nWashington Freedom have been unbeaten throughout this tournament so far. With five wins and a no-result out of six games, they are at the top of the table with 11 points.\n\nThey beat the Texas Super Kings by 42 runs in their previous match. On the other hand, San Francisco Unicorns are placed second with four wins and nine points from six clashes.\n\nThey also beat the Seattle Orcas coming into this game. Both teams have already made it to the Qualifier of MLC 2024, which will be played on July 26. This game will thus serve as a preparatory ground as they will face each other yet again.\n\nOn that note, here is a combined playing 11 with players from both sides ahead of their final league stage match.\n\nCombined San Francisco Unicorns-Washington Freedom playing 11 for MLC 2024\n\nOpeners: Finn Allen, Travis Head\n\nFinn Allen, with 186 runs from five innings at a strike-rate of 202.17, is the fifth-highest run-getter of the tournament. He has scored the most runs for San Francisco this year.\n\nIn their previous outing against Seattle, Allen struck a brutal 30-ball 77, striking at 256.66, that helped them chase down a total of 152 with ease.\n\nPartnering him at the top would be Travis Head, who has also displayed great form for Washington Freedom. With 194 runs from six games, he is the third-highest run-getter of the MLC 2024.\n\nHead has been consistent throughout, smashing three fifties and a hundred, including a 22-ball 53 in the last match.\n\nMiddle-order and all-rounders: Steve Smith (C), Rachin Ravindra, Andries Gous (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Corey Anderson\n\nSteve Smith has proved to be a great inclusion for Washington Freedom this season. He has scored 191 runs from six innings at an average of 63.66 and is the fourth-highest run-getter as well.\n\nThe Washington Freedom skipper scored a crucial 57 in the last game and would also captain this combined side.\n\nRachin Ravindra may not have shone with the bat in the MLC 2024 so far, scoring only 69 runs from four innings. However, he has been a key asset with the ball for Washington Freedom, picking up five wickets, including a four-fer in their previous fixture.\n\nAndries Gous would handle the wicket-keeping duties. He has a fifty to his name this season and has displayed some power-hitting ability. Gous scored a quickfire 9-ball 15 in the last game as well.\n\nGlenn Maxwell has not been as effective with the bat this season yet. He has only managed to score 59 runs from three innings. However, he scored a crucial 23-ball 34 in the previous match and grabbed three wickets as well. His all-round skills make him a valuable asset.\n\nObus Pienaar played a vital role in giving Washington Freedom a solid finish with the bat in their last match. He scored an unbeaten 21-ball 33. Pienaar has displayed his ability to provide stability down the order and contribute with some important runs as well.\n\nCorey Anderson is another all-round who would add to the strength of this combined team. He has a high score of an unbeaten 59 this season and also picked up a wicket in the last game against Texas.\n\nBowlers: Hassan Khan, Jasdeep Singh, Lockie Ferguson\n\nLeft-arm spinner Hassan Khan has picked up six wickets in the tournament for the San Francisco Unicorns. He impressed in the previous game, returning with figures of 3/5 from his two overs, thus also being economical.\n\nJasdeep Singh, coming in for Saurabh Netravalkar, had big shoes to fill in. The right-arm pacer has been brilliant for Washington Freedom in his limited opportunities this season.\n\nJasdeep has picked up six wickets from just two games at an economy rate of 5.57. He also bagged three wickets in their last match against Texas, giving away just 25 runs in four overs.\n\nLockie Ferguson is the fifth-highest wicket-taker in MLC 2024 at the moment. He has accounted for nine wickets from six games with a decent economy rate of 7.27. Ferguson has also picked up four-fer in the MLC this season."

To start, Finn Allen was sent packing on the very first ball of the innings by Akeal Hosein.\n\nDespite the early setback, Jake Fraser-McGurk and Sanjay Krishnamurthi took an aggressive approach, smashing 42 runs in the reduced Powerplay of 4 overs. However, Fraser-McGurk was caught behind by Andries Gous off Andrew Tye in the next over, having scored 18 off 9 balls.\n\nKrishnamurthi, who was dropped by Mukhtar Ahmed at 13 in the second over, reached his fifty off 28 balls in the eighth over. Meanwhile, Josh Inglis delivered a blistering innings of 45 runs off just 17 balls, featuring six sixes and just one four. He smashed three consecutive sixes off Jack Edwards in the ninth over, reducing the target to 67 runs needed from 30 balls.\n\nTye, who was hit for two sixes by Inglis in the second and third balls of his second over, had the last laugh as he dismissed Inglis on the fourth ball and went on to strike again, removing Sherfane Rutherford on the last ball of the 10th over.\n\nKrishnamurthi then took charge of the run chase, teaming up with Hassan Khan to score 33 runs in the next two overs, reducing the target to 22 runs needed from 12 balls. Riding on stunning momentum, both batters chased down the target with ease with two balls to spare.\n\nEarlier in the contest, Steve Smith and Travis Head gave Washington Freedom a flying start, amassing 70 runs in the Powerplay. The pair brought up the team's 100-run mark in 9.3 overs. However, Smith was dismissed by Corey Anderson on the next ball, scoring a remarkable 56 off 31 balls.\n\nHead continued his red-hot form as he reached his fourth successive fifty in 34 balls, but was also dismissed by Anderson in the 12th over after scoring 56 off 36 balls, leaving Washington at 122/2.\n\nRachin Ravindra then played a quick cameo, scoring 16 off 6 balls before getting run out in the 14th over. Gous (29* off 20) continued to find timely boundaries until rain halted play after 15.3 overs, with Washington at 174/3. Having lost time due to the rain delay, the match was then shifted to a 14-over chase for San Francisco, who needed 177 runs for victory.\n\nHaving finished in the top two, both the Washington Freedom and the San Francisco Unicorns square off against each other in the Qualifier on July 25 at 07:30 PM CDT at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-101 (Steven Smith - 9.4 ov), 2-122 (Travis Head - 11.4 ov), 3-155 (Rachin Ravindra - 13.5 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Fall of wickets: 1-0 (Finn Allen - 0.1 ov), 2-45 (Jake Fraser McGurk - 4.4 ov), 3-122 (Josh Inglis - 9.4 ov), 4-122 (Sherfane Rutherford - 9.6 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen\n\nJake Fraser McGurk\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nJosh Inglis(WK)\n\nSherfane Rutherford\n\nCorey Anderson(C)\n\nHassan Khan\n\nTajinder Singh\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nMatt Henry\n\nJuanoy Drysdale\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nTravis Head\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nJack Edwards\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nJustin Dill\n\nAkeal Hosein\n\nAndrew Tye\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Tuesday, July 23, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: San Francisco Unicorns elected to bowl"

Known for his ability to contain runs and provide crucial breakthroughs, Imad's economy rate of 6.52 is among the best in the tournament. His knack for maintaining pressure on the batsmen has been a key component of his bowling strategy, making him one of the more economical bowlers in the league.\n\nZaman Khan\n\nMatches: 4\n\nWickets: 4\n\nEconomy Rate: 7.22\n\nZaman Khan, the young pace sensation, has also shown promise. With an economy rate of 7.22, Zaman has been able to control the run flow effectively. His ability to bowl at the death with precision and pace has made him a valuable asset for the Orcas, even though their campaign has come to an early end.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Haris Rauf and Abrar Ahmed\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns are still in contention for the playoffs of the tournament.\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nMatches: 6\n\nWickets: 3\n\nEconomy Rate: 8.19\n\nHaris Rauf, known for his express pace, has had a challenging season. With only three wickets in six matches and an economy rate of 8.19, Rauf has struggled to replicate his usual wicket-taking prowess. His higher economy rate indicates difficulties in controlling runs, a crucial aspect in T20 cricket. However, his pace and ability to generate bounce can still make him a game-changer in the crucial playoff stages.\n\nAbrar Ahmed\n\nMatches: 2\n\nWickets: 1\n\nEconomy Rate: 8.42"

Finn Allen was sent packing on the very first ball of the innings by Akeal Hosein.\n\nDespite the early setback, Jake Fraser-McGurk and Sanjay Krishnamurthi took an aggressive approach, smashing 42 runs in the Powerplay of 4 overs. However, Fraser-McGurk was caught behind by Andries Gous off Andrew Tye in the next over, having scored 18 off 9 balls.\n\nKrishnamurthi, who was dropped by Mukhtar Ahmed at 13 in the second over, reached his fifty off 28 balls in the eighth over. Meanwhile, Josh Inglis delivered a blistering innings of 45 runs off 17 balls, featuring six sixes and just one four. He smashed three consecutive sixes off Jack Edwards in the ninth over, reducing the target to 67 runs needed from 30 balls.\n\nTye, who was hit for two sixes by Inglis in the second and third balls of his second over, had the last laugh as he dismissed Inglis on the fourth ball and went on to strike again, removing Sherfane Rutherford on the last ball of the 10th over.\n\nKrishnamurthi then took charge of the run chase, teaming up with Hassan Khan to score 33 runs in the next two overs, reducing the target to 22 runs needed from 12 balls. Riding on stunning momentum, both batters chased down the target with ease with two balls to spare.\n\nEarlier in the contest, Steve Smith and Travis Head gave Washington Freedom a flying start, amassing 70 runs in the Powerplay. The pair brought up the team's 100-run mark in the 9.3 over. However, Smith was dismissed by Corey Anderson on the next ball, scoring a remarkable 56 off 31 balls.\n\nHead continued his red-hot form as he reached his fourth successive fifty in 34 balls, but was also dismissed by Anderson in the 12th over after scoring 56 off 36 balls, leaving Washington at 122/2.\n\nRachin Ravindra then played a quick cameo, scoring 16 off 6 balls before getting run out in the 14th over. Gous (29* off 20) continued to find timely boundaries until rain halted play after 15.3 overs, with Washington at 174/3. The match was then shifted to a 14-over chase for San Francisco.\n\nHaving finished in the top two, both Washington Freedom and San Francisco square off against each other in the Qualifier on July 25 at 0730 PM Local Time at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nRachin Ravindra then played a quick cameo, scoring 16 off 6 balls before getting run out in the 14th over.

The wicket of Jason Holder showed the world what he's got.\"\n\nEngland will now target a series sweep when the Windies go to Edgbaston next week, before taking on Sri Lanka in three Tests between late August and early September.\n\n\"It has been a great start after a long break between Test series. I think we've played some good cricket but I still think we can get better,\" Stokes said.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to the next four matches.\"\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events on the fourth day of the second Test at Trent Bridge, the West Indies suffered a resounding 241-run defeat to England, sealing a 2-0 series loss with one Test still to play. Despite the crushing defeat, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite remained optimistic, acknowledging the team's effort while highlighting areas for improvement.\n\nEngland's Shoaib Bashir was the star of the match, claiming his first five-wicket haul on English soil. His 5 for 41 wrapped up the West Indies innings inside 90 minutes of the final session, ensuring England's dominant victory.\n\nReflecting on the match, Brathwaite said, \"I'm reasonably happy with the performance, but it could have been better with the ball. We were good in the first innings but didn't follow through in the second. The effort from the guys was there; the fitness is evident. We need to be much more disciplined. England showed us how to bowl on this pitch, particularly avoiding getting hit square of the wicket. But the guys will learn. Kavem's hundred followed by a duck is just how Test cricket goes.\"\n\nBrathwaite continued, \"We dropped some crucial catches, and that happens. We need to improve our line and length, but catches win matches. I wouldn't have expected that collapse, but it's gone, it's history. Test cricket is never an easy game. We've got to stay tough and keep fighting.\"\n\nEngland's comprehensive win was set up by centuries from Joe Root and Harry Brook, who propelled the hosts to 425 in their second innings. This marked the first time in England's history that they scored over 400 runs in both innings of a Test. Chasing a daunting target of 385, the West Indies started positively, reaching 61 without loss thanks to Brathwaite and Mikyle Louis. However, a devastating spell from Chris Woakes and Bashir saw the team crumble, losing 5 for 21 in the space of 35 balls and ultimately bowled out for 143.\n\nBrathwaite was the top scorer for the West Indies with 47 runs, but his efforts were overshadowed by Bashir's record-breaking performance. At 20 years and 282 days, Bashir became the youngest England bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a men's Test at home, surpassing the previous record held by recently retired seamer James Anderson.\n\nEngland's first innings score of 416, bolstered by Ollie Pope's 121 and contributions from Ben Duckett and Ben Stokes, set the stage for their commanding position. The West Indies initially responded well with 457, featuring a century from Hodge and notable performances from Da Silva and Athanaze. However, the team faltered in their second innings, leading to a decisive English victory."

        "body": "In a match curtailed by rain, the San Francisco Unicorns emerged victorious over the Washington Freedom by six wickets in the Major League Cricket at Dallas on Sunday. The Unicorns chased down a revised target of 177 runs in 13.4 overs, with Sanjay Krishnamurthi’s unbeaten 79 being the cornerstone of their chase. However, the highlight of the match was undoubtedly Akeal Hosein’s dismissal of Finn Allen for a golden duck.\n\nAkil Hossein’s deadly delivery\n\nWhile Krishnamurthi’s inning was undoubtedly crucial, Hosein’s dismissal of Finn captured everyone’s attention. Allen, known for his aggressive batting, came to the crease with high expectations. However, Hosein had other plans.\n\nThe left-arm spinner delivered a skiddy delivery that came into the right-hander. Allen, looking to pull, was deceived by the pace and trajectory of the ball. The delivery crashed into the middle stump, leaving Allen stunned and Washington’s dugout in jubilation.\n\nHosein’s dismissal of Allen was a crucial breakthrough for Washington. It put a dent in the Unicorns’ batting lineup and gave the Freedoms a much-needed early advantage. The wicket also showcased Hossein’s skill and ability to deliver under pressure.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Kieron Pollard’s heartfelt gesture after accidentally hitting a fan with his six in MLC 2024\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns ends the winning streak of Washington Freedom\n\nThe Freedom, batting first, managed to post a respectable total of 174 runs for the loss of three wickets in their allotted 15.3 overs. Steve Smith and Travis Head both contributed half-centuries, but the innings lacked the momentum they needed. Corey Anderson was the pick of the Unicorns’ bowlers, finishing with figures of 2 for 20.\n\nThe Unicorns’ chase started off under immense pressure, losing openers James Frazer-Mcgirk and Allen, both early in the second innings, with the sheer determination and intent of Josh Inglis and Krishnamurthi putting on a 70-run stand. Inglis made a quickfire 45 before being dismissed, but Krishnamurthi continued his assault on the Freedom bowlers. He remained unbeaten on 79, guiding his team to victory with four balls to spare.\n\nThe victory for the Unicorns was a significant one, as it helped them consolidate their position in the points table. The Freedom, on the other hand, will be disappointed with their performance and will need to regroup for their next match as it ended the winning streak for them facing their first loss of the tournament."

The chase, however, wasn’t without its hiccups. Chasing a modest target of 135, New York found themselves in a precarious position at 102/5 in the 13th over. But then came the turning point of the match – Kieron Pollard‘s awe-inspiring display of power hitting.\n\nKieron Pollard unleashes a six-hitting frenzy.\n\nWith the pressure mounting and playoffs hanging in the balance, Pollard stepped onto the field, shouldering the responsibility of reviving his team’s fortunes. The 14th over witnessed a masterclass in power hitting as Pollard took on LA Knight Riders’ bowler Spencer Johnson.\n\nThe first ball was dispatched over mid-wicket for a six, setting the tone for what was to come. Johnson attempted to change tactics with a length ball angling in, but Pollard responded with a monstrous 91-meter six over square leg. The crowd roared in appreciation as Pollard completed the hattrick of sixes with a disdainful chip over the bowler’s head for another maximum.\n\nThese three consecutive sixes not only yielded 18 crucial runs but also completely shifted the match’s momentum. The required run rate, once a daunting task, suddenly seemed achievable. Pollard continued his assault, adding another boundary and bringing his side to an easy match-winning situation with a well-made 33 runs off just 12 deliveries.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Pat Cummins and Corey Anderson star in the comedy of errors on the pitch in MLC 2024\n\nNicholas Pooran’s professional approach gets MI through to playoffs\n\nEarlier, despite Andre Russell‘s 35, LA Knight Riders failed miserably as a batting unit. They started badly and consistently lost wickets, where the middle order could not make a comeback, with many returning to the pavilion scoring single digits. Ultimately, they were restricted to 130 runs thanks to bowling spells from Rashid Khan (3/22) and Nosthush Kenjige (2/22).\n\nOn the other hand, New York started shaky and under immense pressure. Nicholas Pooran took his side home with an assured victory in hand before his fall at the 16th over, scoring a crucial knock of 35 runs."

The wicket came in the final over of LAKR’s innings and ended their challenge at 130 runs, giving Pollard’s team a clear path to chase down the target.\n\nA defining moment for Kieron Pollard\n\nPollard’s dismissal of Russell was a high-pressure scenario that saw the veteran all-rounder rise to the occasion. With LAKR struggling at 102/9 in the 17th over, Russell’s explosive hitting had propelled their score past the 130 runs mark. Russell was on a roll, having struck two boundaries each too Rashid Khan, Romario Shepherd and Trent Boult.

He delivered a length ball, which Russell attempted to pull but could only manage a top edge.

        "body": "Mumbai Indians New York skipper Kieron Pollard led from the front in the game against Los Angeles Knight Riders in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. The 19th match of the tournament between the teams took place at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday (22nd July).\n\nKieron Pollard was at the top of his game with the bat and ball in the game against Los Angeles Knight Riders. In a game where qualification was at stake, the all-rounder came up with a clutch performance and helped his team win the game and enter the playoffs of the second edition of the Major League Cricket.\n\nKieron Pollard first gave himself the responsibility to bowl the last over of the innings against Andre Russell, who was going great guns. The Mumbai Indians New York skipper, however, made sure he stepped up for his team and removed his Carribean teammate to put his team in a strong position.\n\nOn the first ball of the last over, Kieron Pollard banged in a short ball on middle stump. Andre Russell got rushed by it as he tried to pull the ball which hit the splice and went up. Keeper Nicholas Pooran covered a lot of ground to his left and took a good catch.\n\nWhat caught the attention of many was the celebration of Kieron Pollard after he took the wicket of Andre Russell. The Mumbai Indians New York skipper got pumped up as he got rid of a dangerous batter. He celebrated aggressively and the video of that went viral on the internet.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nAfter removing Andre Russell with the ball, Kieron Pollard came up with a magical effort with the bat. Mumbai Indians New York needed to chase the target of 131 runs in 18.2 overs and his team was left tottering at 91/5. But it was the skipper who came up with a magical effort and took his team home.\n\nKieron Pollard scored an unbeaten 33 runs off 12 balls as he did the carnage on the bowlers. The all-rounder batted with a strike rate of 275 and slammed 2 fours and 3 sixes in his innings. His knock ensured that Mumbai Indians New York chased the target in 17 overs and qualified for the playoffs.\n\nIt was a plan that worked out in the end - Kieron Pollard on his bowling\n\nKieron Pollard talked about the win after the game and claimed that he was relieved. He talked about the pride he takes in performing for Mumbai Indians. The all-rounder also opened up about his bowling and stated that his plan worked out. Speaking at the post-match presentation, he explained:\n\n\"Very relieved, congrats to the entire team. The way we fought, everyone chipped in usefully. If we look at the history of how we've batted, 130 was a tough ask. But we got another opportunity, and the attitude shown by everyone was fantastic. I've had some experience, Nosthush came to me after one game and said that things would turn out well, my family was always backing me, coming from a young player, it meant a lot. I always pride myself on performing for the franchise and I'm glad it came off today.\n\n\"It was a plan that worked out in the end (on bowling the 20th over), I could've gone for 20 and they could have got past 150. I could have gone for the young guy (Rushil Ugarkar), but it was one of the days when we got what we wanted. I heard that one of the supporters in the crowd got hit, I hope she's OK and I hope we can do something for her on our part to make her happy,\" he concluded."

In the three matches they have played out of five, they have had two wins and a loss. With six points on the table, they are currently in third, and a win here would confirm a place in the playoffs for them.\n\nThe Washington Freedom have been the best team in the competition so far.

        "body": "3 minute read\n\nAustralia skipper Pat Cummins has joined the party at Major League Cricket as he features for a San Francisco Unicorns side well stacked with Baggy Greens stars.\n\nCummins has a number of fellow Aussies taking part in the 20-over competition in the United States, with Washington Freedom currently leading the way inspired by Steven Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell.\n\nFreedom - 2.40 to secure the MLC title - have won all five of their completed fixtures, with a washout the only thing robbing them of a 100 per cent record, while Cummins features for a Unicorns outfit who lie second in the standings with three wins from five games.\n\nFreedom march on thanks to Aussie batters\n\nIn the most recent fixture Washington saw off Texas Super Kings by 42 runs to maintain their unbeaten record, with Smith and Head both making half-centuries at the top of the order.\n\nIt's fair to say Head dominated the partnership as he was dismissed for 53, having added 59 for the first wicket with Smith, with Maxwell later smacking three sixes in his 34 and then taking three wickets with his off-spin.\n\nHead (194) and Smith (191) have certainly been enjoying themselves with the bat, as they lie third and fourth respectively; in the runscorers' chart in MLC, with South African Faf du Plessis leading the way with 264 runs for Super Kings.\n\nDu Plessis is one of two century-makers in MLC so far this season, with fellow South African Ryan Rickelton the other player to reach three figures, for Seattle Orcas.\n\nAussie pair back up Du Plessis\n\nPlaying alongside former Proteas skipper Du Plessis at Super Kings are Baggy Greens pair Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Hardie, with the former having made more of an impression with the ball than he has with the bat so far.\n\nIn fairness, neither player has excelled to date and both will want to deliver more for their side, with 6.00 Texas currently well-placed to ensure a top-four finish and a place in the play-offs - only two of the six teams miss out on the end-of-season finale.\n\nTim David has also yet to fire for reigning champions MI New York in his three appearances, while both Alex Carey and Adam Zampa have yet to feature for Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nLeft-arm quick Spencer Johnson has sparked for the 9.00 Knight Riders, however, taking eight wickets at 19.75 in his five games to date, although that wickets tally is one less than Maxwell has snapped up for Freedom.\n\nCummins adds to the Aussie mix\n\nThat leaves us with Unicorns, who have added Cummins to a roster which already features his fellow Aussies Matt Short, Josh Inglis and Jake Fraser-McGurk and who are 3.75 to be crowned champions.\n\nShort has passed 50 twice in his four knocks so far this season in MLC, but neither Inglis nor Fraser-McGurk have made significant contributions to date, while Cummins has taken just one wicket across his two appearances.\n\nHe will want to help San Francisco make certain of a play-off place, with Unicorns having missed out during the inaugural MLC season last year, with New York eventually defeating Orcas by seven wickets in the final."

        "body": "Washington Freedom lost to San Francisco Unicorns by six wickets in their rain-shortened final league stage match of the Major League Cricket 2024 season at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday.\n\nTravis Head and captain Steve Smith jointly top-scored for us as we reached 174/3 in 15.3 overs before rain prematurely ended our batting essay. Smith scored 56 off 31 balls and his knock was laden with four sixes and five fours. Whereas Head hit three sixes and five boundaries for his 36-ball 56, his fourth straight fifty in the competition.\n\nChasing a revised target of 177 in 14 overs, the San Francisco Unicorns got to the target in just 13.4 overs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi remained unbeaten on 79 off 42 balls for SFU while Josh Inglis hit 45 from 17 balls.\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Tye finished as the top wicket-taker in the match with figures of 3/41.\n\nBatting first, Head and Smith did what they have done throughout the season, by providing us a rollicking start. Smith took the role of the aggressor smashing three sixes and five fours in the powerplay as we raced to 70/0 after the first six overs, the fourth fifty-plus stand for the Aussies together this season.\n\nSmith powered to a 25-ball fifty in the eighth over and soon the duo got to our first 100-run partnership in the history of MLC before the skipper departed. Head shifted gears to get to his half-century in just 34 balls continuing his purple patch this season.\n\nRachin Ravindra and Andries Gous kept the scoring rate high with an entertaining partnership of 33 off only 15 balls. Just as we were looking to go past the 200-run mark for the second consecutive game, rain halted proceedings, cutting short our batting essay with 27 balls remaining.\n\nAkeal Hosein gave us a great start after the rain delay, striking with the first ball of the chase to send back Finn Allen. Andrew Tye dismissed the big fish, Jake Fraser-McGurk, leaving both openers back in the hut by the fifth over with the score at 45.\n\nThe experienced Tye brought us back into the match with two wickets in an over after Krishnamurthi and Inglis added 77 runs in just 30 balls for the third wicket. In the end, the San Francisco Unicorns chased down the target with two balls to spare.\n\nHassan Khan contributed a cameo of 32 from 11 balls, while Krishnamurthi remained unbeaten on 79. Apart from Tye, Hosein picked up 1/39 from his three overs.\n\nHowever, the result had no bearing on the points table of MLC 2024 as we finished on top with 11 points from seven games after all our group engagements.\n\nWe will meet the San Francisco Unicorns again in the Qualifier of MLC 2024 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday.\n\nWashington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns MLC 2024 brief scores: WF 174/3 in 15.3 overs (Steve Smith 56, Travis Head 56, Corey Anderson 2/20) vs SFU 177/4 in 13.4 overs (Sanjay Krishnamurthi 79*, Josh Inglis 45, Andrew Tye 3/41, Akeal Hosein 1/39).\n\nWashington Freedom lost by six wickets by DLS method."

        "body": "After the ICC Mens T20 World Cup thrilled American sports fans with top-tier cricket matches at venues in Florida, New York and Texas, Major League Cricket is gearing up for an exciting second season of progress.\n\nMajor League Cricket will conclude its 21-match season this week, culminating in a thrilling four-team play-off to crown a new champion. Despite having six teams spread across the country, all competitions are being held on dedicated cricket grounds in Texas and North Carolina. Remarkably, attendances are on track to surpass the impressive 70,000 fans who turned out for the inaugural season in 2023.\n\nA key strategy Major League Cricket has employed to attract a broader audience is its media rights arrangement with Cricbuzz’s Willow, a specialist cricket channel. Willow has established partnerships with regional sports networks in each team’s local market, including Bally Sports SoCal for Los Angeles, Monumental Sports Network for Washington, DC, and NBC Sports Bay Area for San Francisco, among many others. This tactic mirrors Willow’s successful approach during the T20 World Cup, where it focused on increasing visibility.\n\nIn terms of finances, Major League Cricket operates within a salary cap of $1.15 million per team. While this figure is below the generous budgets seen in global leagues such as the Indian Premier League, which allows franchises to spend around $12 million annually, it remains competitive with leagues such as Cricket Australia ($2 million) and The Hundred ($1.3 million) in the UK.\n\nLiam Plunkett, a bowler for the San Francisco Unicorns and member of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, praises the quality and competitiveness of the competition. “The money is good. But the product is good too,” Plunkett notes, highlighting the high standard of play that attracts fans and players alike.\n\nSan Francisco’s signing of Australian national team captain Pat Cummins on a four-year contract ahead of the season was a major move that reflects the league’s ambition. Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman reveals that such contracts have proven surprisingly feasible given the excitement surrounding the emerging US cricket market.\n\nLooking ahead, the league has ambitious plans for expansion, aiming to establish stadiums in each team’s market and expand the schedule to 34 games by 2025. With the intention of increasing the number of franchises to 10, Major League Cricket is poised for continued growth and success in the American sports landscape.\n\nRelated\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.
