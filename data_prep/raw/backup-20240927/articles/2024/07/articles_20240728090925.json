However, opener Travis Head, was once again in a destructive mood as he brought up his fifth consecutive fifty in the tournament.

Excerpts:\n\nThis is your first stint in the franchise world outside of the IPL, if I'm not wrong. Why America as a coaching destination?\n\nWell, a lot of friends of mine and coaches and guys that I'm pretty close to played in MLC last year. And during the IPL, it was spoken about a little bit, last year even about potential for some growth here and how big the game already was in the US. Everyone I spoke to last year, had a really good time and enjoyed the tournament and felt that it will just get bigger and better. So I wanted to get involved early on to have a look at it.\n\nAnd I think all of us that are here now play a role in promoting the game. Even though I'm here coaching and looking after this team Washington Freedom, I think the fact that ex-international players are being involved in a tournament like this will hopefully help it grow.\n\nIs it also a means to carve out a legacy for the Freedom franchise by leading them in their nascent stages, and basically formulating that culture, identity, and the way they go about their cricket in a manner that is on course with your beliefs and other decision makers around you?\n\nYeah, absolutely. I think Cameron White and Shawn Bradstreet were here last year along with Michael Klinger. I think they'd set a pretty good culture. The team made the playoffs, but didn't go all the way. The plan going forward for us this year was to make sure we have sustained success and as you say, build the right culture for this franchise. I think I've been lucky to be around a lot of really successful teams as a player and as a coach, and got a pretty good grasp on cultural sort of matters. It's what makes me a good coach, and what I think makes people enjoy me being around them. So that's what I continue to work on every day. Talking to a lot of the guys here, there's a lot of them that haven't been around a lot of international experience like I've been able to bring here. So that makes it more enjoyable for me to work in that sort of environment.\n\nThere are about 15 Aussies in the MLC. Most of them are your star Australian cricketers that were part of the World Cup squad. Now compare that to The Hundred where there are only four Australia cricketers. We know Aussie cricketers are a golden asset for any league, so is the cricketing world order changing right now in front of our eyes?\n\nI think the whole game is in quite an interesting phase right now with different tournaments almost popping up every year. A lot of those tournaments overlap. Even the BBL in Australia overlaps with ILT20 and also the SA20. It's good and bad for players, I guess. Players get a chance to play in lots of different competitions. But with the overlapping like we've seen with San Francisco Unicorns' Matthew Short leaving MLC early to go to play in The Hundred, that's one thing I'm not a big fan of. I don't like seeing players leave early to go and play in a different tournament, and I think it's something that needs to be addressed going forward. I think there need to be certain windows cut out for every tournament - make sure there's clean air for that tournament to get over and done with, and keep their players for the big games. I've been there before with the BBL, where you sign players up at the start and you make the finals and you lose your stars when the big games come around. That's not ideal for anybody.\n\nBut I think a lot of the players have probably had a similar attitude like me, that they wanted to have a look at MLC in the early days. Get involved early and hopefully be part of the growth. Even having someone like Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell here. As you say there are a lot of big name Australian players playing this year. And I think that's great for the tournament.\n\nWas there also the lure of leaving your imprints on a franchise and making a legacy for yourself?\n\nI don't look at it that way. I don't look at leaving legacy or imprints. I just want to get here and do the best job that I can and make sure that the players understand what I'm all about and how much I love working with good players and making them better. More importantly, understand how important winning is to me. That's the first thing I say to any group that I come to - that anything we do from here until the end of this tournament, we'll find ways to to get better and win. That attitude certainly seems to work so far this year.\n\nWith the type of personality you are, you're all in when you take up an assignment. It has come to my knowledge that you were heavily active on the team WhatsApp group, and tried to stay on top of what was going on in the practice sessions even while you were in the Caribbean. So what sort of involvement can we expect from you with Freedom in the future? Especially considering the task of bridging the gap between domestic talent and international talent.\n\nIt actually wasn't ideal for me this year as my first year with this team, considering the overlap with the World Cup. But when Michael Klinger rang me and asked me to think about the job, the first thing I said was, 'Look, I know I'm actually going to be in the Caribbean, and I'll be commentating in the World Cup final. So it's not gonna be perfect for you. It's not gonna be perfect for me.' But, I think our conversations first started maybe in about January when I was working in the BBL. Right back then when I decided to go ahead and do it, then I was the one that was reaching out to make sure we signed the right players as well. So, my involvement sort of stems back to getting Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, these guys to come and sign here and play with us.\n\nWhen I'm here, I'm obviously heavily involved. Even some of the players the last couple of days have come to me and said we can't believe how actively involved you are with throwing balls all day, every day and being out in the field and running drills and things like that. But that's my opportunity to make players better. So I don't ever want to miss a minute or a practice session where I'm not giving my best to make every player in the squad as good as they can be. That's just the way that I am. It's ingrained in me. I'm not going to sit back and waste any time around cricket. And that's one of the other things I say to the boys first off is I don't like lazy people. I don't like people with talent that don't try and get the most out of themselves. So if I can show that attitude as a retired player and almost impose on them the way that I want them to go about their cricket while I'm here then hopefully that only makes them better.\n\n'I've played 15 years of cricket with him [Justin Langer]. I actually didn't even look at him or shake his hand until the game or games were over. So that's just my competitive nature coming out' ©BCCI\n\nAs a captain, you had mentioned in your autobiography that you asked the team not to address Kevin Pietersen as 'KP', or for that matter not call any of the Englishmen by their nicknames during the 2006-07 home Ashes. You stated you were too chummy with them in the previous series and now wanted to impose yourselves on them. There was also another side to it where Justin Langer once revealed how you asked the team to be humble before the final English wicket fell in the Perth Test when you were about to clinch that series. Does franchise cricket allow for these intense mind games? Have you ever done something similar to that as a coach?\n\nYes and I'd love to give a bit of an example for that as well. One thing that I always struggled with the IPL, obviously, was that a lot of the Indian guys play in the national team together and you tend to get to the ground really early - about two hours before the game starts. And a lot of the players sort of catch up on the ground and put their arms around each other and give them a cuddle whenever they meet each other before the game starts, but I'd never do that. Justin Langer this year, for instance. I've played 15 years of cricket with him. I actually didn't even look at him or shake his hand until the game or games were over. So that's just my competitive nature coming out.\n\nIt probably doesn't change the outcome but I think it sets a pretty good idea to the opposition that I'm there to get my job done and to have my team win that game of cricket. I'll probably have been a little bit more relaxed here to be honest. I actually saw Shane Watson before our last game but the only reason we crossed paths was we were having team photos on the ground, otherwise I would have stayed away from him. Pravin Amre has been an assistant coach with me at Delhi for seven years. I didn't see him until after the game was over so that's just me, but everyone's different I guess.\n\nWhat Rishabh's been through last year is one that's probably the most emotional, with how close I was with him and what he went through and the fear of all of us that he might not play cricket again. Seeing him back and doing what he's doing and leading DC, I think it's a pretty emotional time for everyone.\n\n***\n\nSix IPL seasons with DC is quite a long time. How have you evolved as a coach over the years at DC?\n\nI actually think even though I'm quite intense, I'm a bit more relaxed as a coach now than I once was. I'm better at understanding an individual's own preparation better than I probably once was. Coming reasonably new out of the game and straight into coaching, it was easy for me to sit back and expect everyone to train the same way that I did. But that doesn't necessarily bring the best out in people.\n\nSo even in this tournament, yes we've played well, but I think we've probably only had one or two compulsory training sessions on the way. The rest of them have been optional. I've left it up to the players. I've told them that I've got full trust in them to understand what they need, as far as their preparation is concerned, if they don't come to train, that's fine. But if they come to training, make sure they come with a real intent and purpose to get something out of it and try and improve. So I think that's probably the biggest thing. I try to learn more about people quicker and understand who they are as people more so than cricketers. I think if I do that I gain respect back pretty quickly and then hopefully they'll perform for you.\n\nYou mentioned the way you adapted to allow individuals the liberty to prepare as per their individual preferences. Would you want to add to this list where you would have learned something new which quashed or sort of negated some of your beliefs regarding your own coaching philosophy?\n\nI'm still learning every day. And if I'm not then I'm probably wasting my time because you get so many people around you that you can learn from. Little things I've tried to do in this tournament is that this group has played a lot of golf together since we've been here. And one thing I've tried to do is make sure that I'm playing in the groups with the local boys for five hours a day, rather than playing with Maxwell, Smith and Head, all the guys I know. I'm wasting five hours if I do that when I can be playing with Gous and Obus and Justin Dill and these guys. That's a perfect opportunity for me to learn more about them and spend time with them and have them understand that I actually chose to play with you guys this day over playing with the Aussie guys. So I've just tried to maximise my time with them here but also make sure that I've given them their own space. I think that's another important thing for me as a coach now is you gotta understand that you are a coach, you're not one of the players.\n\nIn an interview with Cricbuzz three years back, you had mentioned how you were a relationship-based coach. Over the course of six years you might have built some strong interpersonal relationships at DC. Can you recall having some moving moments with some of the individuals at DC that will kind of stay with you for the longest time?\n\nI haven't spoken publicly about not being there next year. I sort of let it go because I was here and been paying pretty close attention to what I'm doing here. Look, I had a great time there. DC, for me, was like my second home and my family was there with me for a month or five weeks in the last three or four years. It hasn't always been the most successful franchise. So we tried to build a real family inclusive environment where everyone was treated the same and everyone was on the same page.\n\nI mean what Rishabh's been through last year is one that's probably the most emotional, with how close I was with him and what he went through and the fear of all of us that he might not play cricket again. Seeing him back and doing what he's doing and leading DC, I think it's a pretty emotional time for everyone.\n\nSo it is what it is, we've decided to part ways and we decided to move on but that doesn't mean that I won't be coaching again. I'm very keen to get back involved in the IPL. There might be a few opportunities coming up and we'll see what happens over the next few weeks.\n\nYou have been fabulous at nurturing young talent during your time as the Australian captain as well as a coach in the IPL. Speaking to some of the domestics at Washington Freedom, they haven't been short of singing your praises on the experience they had with you. What is the first quality you want to see in a young player?\n\nIt depends where you are in a scouting role, or a coaching role. You want to see skill and talent first. But my coaching mantra is based around four words. That's attitude, effort, commitment, and care. I think as a coach, it's much easier to coach skill than it is to try and change someone's attitude, or character. So, give me the right attitude and the right effort, and the right commitment, then I feel that I can make those players better, but you give me the highest skill players that don't want to change, then they're wasting everyone's time.\n\nEven in a tournament like this, where there's been a lot of players that I've seen, I sit back and say, 'Well, that kid's good, he's got some real talent.' A lot of those are the ones that we've got here, which has made working here that bit more fun. I've obviously had a lot of players on the other end of the scale. Even at DC there's a lot of players that I've coached there that are highly talented players that I haven't been able to change. It's disappointing for me and it's also disappointing for the player not to be able to understand and see how much better they can become if they really want to.\n\nPiggybacking on what you've said there is also this curious case of supremely talented Prithvi Shaw that went from the most promising to being benched in the final season at DC. How does the coach's role become important in that situation where you have to handle people with truckloads of talent who are sort of outliers?\n\nI mean to start with I don't like talking about individual players, but Prithvi shouldn't be an outlier. He should be someone that's in every team; the first pick in most teams with the skill that he's got. He's had a chance to represent India as a youngster, making a hundred on his Test debut. And as you say, halfway through this year, we couldn't find a slot for him in our DC team. So that's disappointing for me as a coach not to be able to make certain players better and get the best out of them. But sometimes there's only so much you can give and so many times you can try. When you feel like you're not making players better and they're not doing what you need for the team, then you've got to look for other players that can do it for you.\n\nSo that then comes back to the player. With him in particular I've had a lot of chats with him, a lot of conversations to try and make him a better cricketer. I mean, he's still a young man. And he's still a very talented young player. And hopefully one day the penny really drops for him and he works out what he needs to do to be the best cricketer that he can be.\n\nTravis Head, Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell are part of the Washington Freedom setup ©Getty\n\nMarcus Stoinis mentioned not too long back that Maxwell, one of your Freedom stars, is the most talented batter he has ever seen till date. An Australian media outlet reported about his Test comeback on the tour of Sri Lanka. It is this outrageous talent of his that has had Cricket Australia toying with the idea of having him back in the Test scheme of things time and again. Obviously, we all know the range of strokes that he has. That makes him extra special. But coming from your X-ray eyes, if you can dissect Maxwell the batsman, his mind and the superhuman talent that he possesses.\n\nI think Glenn's name quite often gets thrown up when it's a subcontinent tour because of what he can do with bat and ball. He gives the Australian team a lot of flexibility as far as a second spin bowling option or even sometimes a third spin bowling if they go that way. I've known Glenn for a long time, and hopefully he gets the chance to play Test cricket again. But he's really made his name for himself in white ball cricket. He's had some outrageously good moments throughout his career.\n\nGuys like that who have that X factor talent about them, I don't like to talk to them too much about their cricket. You just have to be really careful with the way that you phrase things in the way that you speak to them. Because for players that have got that sort of talent, you don't want to get in their way. You don't want to have something that you said in the back of their mind that can actually stop that X factor play coming out. So for me, it's much easier to coach the guys that have less talent and less skill because I think I can help them and give them things that they can think about that can make them better.\n\nAnd Travis is exactly the same right now. I mentioned in one of our postgame chats the other night that there's a lot of things that I could talk to Travis about with his batting but I'm not going to because it's all good. It's going so well that I don't need to get in the back of his head. I don't want to be this little voice sitting on his shoulder. I want him to play with freedom and keep doing what he's doing and Maxwell was a bit the same. So it's hard to dissect. Now that AB de Villiers and those guys aren't around, Glenn and Suryakumar are probably the most complete 360-degree players in the modern game. And with what he can bring with the other dimensions to his cricket - his fielding and with the ball - he's obviously a very, very good player.\n\nDo you think people like Glenn Maxwell are a prototype of a T20 batter 10 years from now?\n\nGlenn probably almost had some of this flamboyance coached out of him when he was young. He got out a lot playing the reverse sweep and the switch hit when he was younger. Had coaches left, right and centre and commentators and media, and probably even me being one in certain times were questioning why he was trying to do that. But if he hadn't worked on it then and he hadn't got so good at playing it, then we wouldn't see the Glenn Maxwell of now. So he's shown a lot of courage to continue to play the way that he wants to play. For 10 or 12 years now he's reaped the rewards whether that's on-field performance or certainly the money he's made from the game has been on the back of the skill set that he's had.\n\nSince we have touched the future and you are one of the most prominent voices in the game, where do you see the international cricket calendar heading towards? How does one maintain the sanctity of Test cricket? And also be mindful that franchise cricket is the real cash cow now for the international players living outside of India. There is an argument to play only Test cricket as bilaterals and the white ball cricket only in ICC tournaments. What's your opinion on that?\n\nI don't want to see any international cricket played less. I just think it's something that's been sort of happening even when I was playing. Probably when the IPL started up was when this sort of stuff started to happen. Conversations were around about franchise cricket compared to international cricket. It's got to the point now where franchise cricket is probably the most talked about and certainly the most played because there are so many leagues around the world that have been allowed to start up, and international cricket is trying to slot in around these tournaments now, which is the opposite way that it used to be.\n\nSo there's some great challenges there but I would hate to see one day cricket, for instance, only played during World Cup years. I think there's a time and a place for all three formats. Where the game gets in trouble is when we start comparing one format to the other and immediately playing a Test match on the back of a 50-over or T20 World Cup. A great example is the last T20 World Cup that was in Australia that England won, they stayed on in Australia after that to play some one-dayers against Australia and I took my son to the MCG with his U-11 team to watch a contest between Australia and England. There were something like 8000 people there. When I was playing Australia vs England at the MCG, it was 80,000 plus every game. So that's the scheduling, and that's the unfortunate thing about it. There's still as many people watching the game as ever, they're just choosing what they want to watch and when they want to watch it.\n\nIf you've just had an international Test series, don't expect the attendance to be strong for the ODI series against Sri Lanka in the West Indies immediately after it for they'll be watching it at home. So that's the one thing we have to understand. But look, I'm not sure where it's headed. Well I know where it's headed. Obviously more and more franchise-based cricket where I think we're going to see in a lot of countries like New Zealand, like the West Indies have been doing for a long time and maybe Sri Lanka, these sorts of countries that don't get paid a lot to play international cricket then they're going to be choosing franchise cricket over international stuff which is a little bit sad, but that's the reality of the world right now.\n\nFor the most part in your playing days, you were someone who non-Australian fans hated to love because of your skill, how unabashedly pro-team or pro-teammates you were, which obviously the fans from the rest of the world were not fond of. Now after retirement that is exactly the quality the fans from MI, which you coached once, DC or Freedom now love about you. You won a lot of trophies as a player, but seem to be winning more hearts as a coach. Did you expect this turn around?\n\nI don't know if I expected it, or I didn't really care too much to be honest. When I was playing, I mean everything you said there was right. All I cared about was the guys on my team and making sure I was doing the right thing by them as people and players and getting results for them. When I was the captain of the Australian cricket team, I looked at myself as a protector, my job was to protect my teammates and look after them. I was a senior player and had lots of younger players coming in. The cold, hard facts of it is that international cricket can be a tough, lonely place. Some young players need older people like me around to look after them and protect them.\n\nThe way I describe it is when I was playing, I had a helmet on, I didn't say anything, didn't give anything away. But now that I've retired and taken my helmet off, I can actually start to show the world and people that maybe that wasn't me as a person. That was me trying to do my job as an Australian cricket captain. I want people to enjoy the time that they have when I'm around them, basically. If that means that I protect them or look after them or make them better, then at the end of the day that's what my job is.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet"

        "body": "Washington Freedom will take on the San Francisco Unicorns in the Play-Off 2 match of Major League Cricket 2024.\n\nWashington Freedom Vs San Francisco Unicorns Play-Off 2 Preview\n\nThis is the big-money match of this tournament to this point, despite the two teams having faced each other earlier this week. The winner of this one will book their place in the final.\n\nWashington Freedom has been in scintillating form in this competition. With five wins and one loss in seven games, they finished on top of the league table with 11 points. Their superb net run rate shows how dominant this team has been throughout the tournament. With openers Travis Head and Steve Smith in the top three run-scorers and Saurabh Netravalkar the top wicket-taker this season, they will have an eye on the trophy.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have been equally good. They also have five wins, one loss and 11 points in the league, but are in second due to net run rate. But they have one thing over the Freedom. These two teams collided for the first time this season earlier this week, and that match was won by the Unicorns. They will look to repeat their win from the last match and confirm a place in the final.\n\nWF Vs SFU Play-Off 2 MLC 2024: Match Details\n\nMatch: Washington Freedom Vs San Francisco Unicorns, Major League Cricket Play-Off 2\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium, Dallas, Texas\n\nDate & Time: Friday, July 26, 6:00 AM (IST)/ July 25, 7:30 PM (local time)\n\nLive Broadcast and Streaming: Sony Sports Network, JioCinema App & Website\n\nWF Vs SFU Announced Squads\n\nWashington Freedom Announced Squad\n\nCorey Anderson (C), Finn Allen, Matthew Short, Sherfane Rutherford, Jake Fraser-McGrk, Josh Inglis (wk), Tajinder Dhillon, Pat Cummins, Jahmar Hamilton (wk), Wiaan Mulder, Hassan Khan, Haris Rauf, Matt Henry, Karima Gore, Carmi le Roux, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Liam Plunkett, Brody Couch, Abrar Ahmed\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Announced Squad\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (wk) (C), Aaron Jones, Quinton de Kock (wk), Hammad Azam, Nuaman Anwar, Michael Bracewell, Shehas Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjane, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Harmeet Singh, Imad Wasim, Nathan ellis, Obed McCoy, Ali Sheikh, Cameron Gannon, Lance Morris, Nandre Burgerm Zaman Khan, Ayan Desai\n\nWashington Freedom Vs San Francisco Unicorns Pitch Report\n\nIt is a solid batting pitch that can generate 180+ scores on any day, although targets of 150-170 are much more realistic. Fast bowlers will find some movement, especially early in the inning.\n\nThe ball starts sticking to the pitch as the match proceeds, which might help medium pacers with a lot of variations. Quality spinners too can muddle the middle overs.\n\nWashington Freedom Vs San Francisco Unicorns Weather Report\n\nWith temperature in the mid-20s and high humidity, the conditions will be a little sticky at the time of the match. The humidity will also result in a lot of dew falling, especially in the second inning.\n\nThe skies will be overcast, but the chances of rain are minimal. It will also be normally windy at the time of the match.\n\nWF Vs SFU Predicted Playing XI\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted Playing XI\n\nTravis Head, Steve Smith (C), Andreis Gous (wk), Rachin Ravindra, Mukhtar Ahmed, Jack Edwards, Obus Pienaar, Justin Dill, Akeal Hosein, Andrew Tye, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Predicted Playing XI\n\nFinn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Josh Inglis (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Corey Anderson (C), Hassan Ali, Tajinder Singh, Juanoy Drysdale, Haris Rauf, Carmi de Roux\n\nWF Vs SFU Head To Head Record\n\nMatches Played: 02\n\nWashington Freedom Won: 01\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Won: 01\n\nNo Result: 00\n\nFirst Played: July 23, 2023\n\nLast Played: July 23, 2024\n\nWF vs SFU Dream11 Prediction\n\nThis is arguably the toughest game to call this season. These two teams have been the best two sides in this tournament. And while San Francisco won this match-up just days ago, that was a very close game.\n\nIt has to be said that Washington has won their games in a more dominating fashion this season, which might make them slight favourites in this one. That is compounded by brilliant tournaments that several individuals are having in this team.\n\nWhile yes, this game might be too close to call, Washington Freedom will walk into this one as slight favourites.\n\nWF vs SFU Dream11 Prediction: Washington Freedom will defeat San Francisco Unicorns in the 23rd Match of Major League Cricket 2024\n\nCheck Out: WF vs SFU Match Prediction"

        "date": "Fri Jul 26 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Washington Freedom convincingly beat the San Francisco Unicorns to book their place in this year’s Major League Cricket final with the elimination of MI New York in the first playoff against Texas, where the competition will crown a new winner this year. And given their stellar run in the season, where they finished on top, it seems the team representing the capital is the team to beat.\n\nIt was a dominant show all around by the Washington Freedom. Having restricted the Unicorns to 145 in 19 overs, the Washington Freedom wasted little time in chasing down the score. With destroyer-in-chief, Travis Head led the way with a dominant 77 off 44 inclusive of three sixes and ten fours. When chasing the Washington Freedom, despite losing wickets cheaply, they maintained their rhythm to cruise to a seven-wicket win.\n\nWashington Freedom Bowlers Bowl Out the Unicorns\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIn a closely fought season between the two top sides, it was interesting to see who would come out on top. The team winning the toss seems to have the advantage for the most part, and when the Freedom captain Steve Smith won the toss he elected to bowl first. And having done so his decision was backed up well as his bowlers came to the party. A major concern for the Unicorns has been the inconsistency at the top of the order. The rising star player Jake Fraser-McGurk produced another failure managing just 11 off 11 deliveries.\n\nWhat followed was a tame batting performance by the side from San Francisco as none of the top-order players made an impact. The saving grace came in the form of Hassan Khan who scored 57 off 36 and a resistant 26 off 19 by Corey Anderson. Given the lack of big scores from top-order batsmen, the Unicorns struggle to a 145 before being bowled out in the 19th over.\n\nDominant Travis Head Leads the Washington Charge\n\nTravis Head is in the form of his life. His remarkable innings in the 2023 World Cup final have set him on a cracking path of batting dominance. Opening the innings Travis Head played an unbeaten 77 off 44 delivers inclusive of 13 boundaries in total. When chasing a modest target like 145, this sort of inning knocked the wind out of the Unicorns’ sails.\n\nThe side from San Francisco despite knocking over a few Washington top-order batsmen, were unable to keep a lid on the scoring and when fellow Australia international Glen Maxwell joined the fray, the game quickly got away from the defending side. Maxwell scored a rapid 56 off 23 with five sixes: a strike rate of 234+. This was the last nail in the coffin as the Washington Freedom got home with over four overs to spare.\n\nWashington Freedom into Major League Cricket Final\n\nSo we now have a new finalist in the Major League Cricket tournament. The Washington Freedom as the most dominant side this year has booked a deserving spot in the final. The question is can they go one step further and clinch the trophy? They certainly have the team to do so, and all would wait for what becomes the final playoff game between the Texas Super Kings and the Unicorns, who have another shot at qualification.\n\nFor More Great Content"

Glenn Maxwell also scored a quickfire fifty during the chase.\n\nMeanwhile, the Unicorns progressed to the final with a 10-run win over the Texas Super Kings in the Challenger on Friday.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar continues to top the bowling charts in MLC 2024 with 14 wickets from six matches at an average of 12.07 runs and an impressive strike rate of 9.57.\n\nTravis Head and captain Steve Smith continue their run in the top five overall run-getters list this year, at second and fifth place, respectively.

He kept things tight bowling 11 dot balls out of the total 16 he delivered and struck at regular intervals.\n\nMarco Jansen also played a crucial role picking up three big hitters, Finn Allen, Josh Inglis and Corey Anderson, in his spell. The trio of Netravalkar, Jansen and Ravindra’s performance will be crucial as we look to restrict the same opponent in the final.\n\nOn the batting front, Head continues his impressive run of form with five consecutive fifties in MLC 2024. His unbeaten 77 off just 44 balls was an important knock, as we lost an early wicket and two more in the middle phase during the chase. A sixth fifty and we might well be near the trophy.\n\nMaxwell also played his part with the bat changing the course of the game, walking in at 64/3.

        "body": "Washington Freedom qualified for the final of the Major League Cricket 2024 season by winning the Qualifier against the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas on Thursday. This puts us within touching distance of our maiden MLC title.\n\nThe captain-coach duo of Steve Smith and Ricky Ponting has developed a well-knit side that has been clinical and delivered some gritty performances. As we get ready to play our first final of MLC in just its second year, here is a glance at our consistent journey so far this season, highlighting the match results and key performers.\n\nGame 1 vs MI New York, Morrisville\n\nWe started our MLC 2024 campaign with a win over defending champions MI New York by four runs under the DLS method in a rain-shortened match in Morrisville. We reached 55/1 after restricting MINY to 154/9 before rain intervened and halted further play.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar and Justin Dill shone with the ball, picking up 3/24 and 3/33, respectively, as MINY were restricted to 154 due to the regular fall of wickets.\n\nMeanwhile, our skipper Steve Smith, got off to a memorable start both as a batter and as captain. Smith’s counter-attacking display, where he scored 22 runs in a single over, got us over the line, as we were ahead of the par score when play was stopped.\n\nGame 2 vs Texas Super Kings, Morrisville\n\nOur second game in Morrisville was also affected by rain, as our match against the Texas Super Kings was called off.\n\nAfter TSK reached a huge total of 203/5, we were on track as we raced to 62/0 in just four overs. Unfortunately, we needed to complete five overs for the DLS method to calculate the par score, so the match was abandoned.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nNetravalkar got two wickets, while both Travis Head and Steve Smith got to brisk starts in a game where we shared points with TSK.\n\nGame 3 vs Seattle Orcas, Dallas\n\nThis was our first full game in MLC 2024. We were put in a tough position in the second innings, chasing 125 against the Seattle Orcas in Dallas.\n\nReduced to 64/5, the team showed grit and resilience to come back and win the match by five wickets. This was undoubtedly the most important two points we earned in the league phase.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nLockie Ferguson’s four-fer and Netravalkar’s three-wicket haul was half the job done. But it was the unbeaten sixth partnership of 63 between Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar during the chase that changed the course of the game.\n\nGame 4 vs Los Angeles Knight Riders, Morrisville\n\nWith a hard-fought win in the last game, we rose from strength to strength in our next match. We beat Los Angeles Knight Riders by eight wickets, our highest margin of victory by wickets, in Morrisville in our fourth game to cement our position on top of the points table.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nNetravalkar was again the pick among bowlers with a spell of 4/35 as Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell picked up three and two wickets, respectively. LAKR were restricted to 129, while Travis Head got his first fifty to take us home with four overs to spare.\n\nGame 5 vs MI New York, Dallas\n\nThis was our second win against MINY in the 2024 edition of the MLC. The 94-run win in Dallas was our highest in terms of runs this season and also made us the first team to qualify for the playoffs of MLC this year.\n\nAfter scoring 182/5, our bowlers did an admirable job of restricting the opposition to just 88 runs as the game came to a close with 6.3 overs remaining.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nTravis Head warmed up for the crucial matches ahead by scoring his second fifty of the tournament, while homeboy Andries Gous also scored a half-century. Rachin Ravindra’s game-changing cameo was crucial for us as we posted a big score in the first innings.\n\nHowever, Jasdeep Singh’s MLC debut was the highlight of the night. He seized the opportunity with open hands, recording figures of 3/14. Jasdeep, the player of the match, was well supported by Marco Jansen, Ferguson, and Maxwell, who each picked up two wickets.\n\nGame 6 vs Texas Super Kings, Dallas\n\nBatting first against Texas Super Kings in Dallas, we notched up our highest score in the history of MLC, 206/5. The result was a 42-run win over TSK, who scored 164 in the second innings.\n\nThis win was important too, as it helped us continue our winning momentum from the start of the season and also gave us an advantage of a top-two finish in the points table.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nOpeners Head and Smith once again set the tone as Glenn Maxwell put his all-round skills on display with a 30-plus score with the bat and a three-wicket haul with the ball.\n\nJasdeep made an impact for the second straight match in a row picking three crucial wickets as Ravindra finished with an impressive haul of 4/16.\n\nGame 7 vs San Francisco Unicorns, Dallas\n\nWe got our first defeat this season in our last league match against San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. In a third match affected by rain, we fell short by six wickets under the DLS method.\n\nIt was an excellent batting display from SFU, headlined by Sanjay Krishnamurthi with an unbeaten 79, which made our first-innings tally look inadequate.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nThe Australian trio of Smith, Head and Andrew Tye did well for us, albeit in a losing cause, with the openers scoring fifties and Tye picking up three wickets.\n\nQualifier vs San Francisco Unicorns, Dallas\n\nWe came back well in the Qualifier match of MLC 2024 in Dallas, registering a win against SFU by seven wickets to progress to the final of the event.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nIt was a clinical show from our side, with both the batters and bowlers contributing in equal measure to our win. Ravindra recorded career-best figures with the ball, as Jansen and Netravalkar too contributed.\n\nHead and Maxwell were at their imperious best as the duo smashed eight sixes and 14 boundaries among them."

Here’s an analysis to help you understand who might reign supreme:\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Wednesday, July 24, 2024\n\nTime: 6:00 AM (PDT)\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas\n\nTexas Super Kings Preview\n\nA strong batting lineup featuring Devon Conway, Faf du Plessis, Aaron Hardie, and the powerful duo of Mitchell Santner and Daryl Mitchell can wreak havoc on the opposition.\n\nDwayne Bravo and Mohammad Mohsin bring experience, while youngsters like Noor Ahmad and Zia-ul-Haq add depth to the bowling attack. Playing at their home ground, Grand Prairie Stadium, could give TSK a psychological edge and familiarity with the pitch conditions.\n\nTexas Super Kings Squad: Devon Conway (wk), Faf du Plessis (c), Aaron Hardie, Joshua Tromp, Marcus Stoinis, Milind Kumar, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, Mohammad Mohsin, Noor Ahmad, Zia-ul-Haq, Naveen-ul-Haq, Aiden Markram, Mitchell Santner, Daryl Mitchell, Cameron Stevenson, Ottneil Baartman, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Zia Shahzad, Raj Nannan\n\nSeattle Orcas Preview\n\nTheir batting heavily relies on Quinton de Kock for a strong start.
