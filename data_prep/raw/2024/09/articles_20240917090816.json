        "body": "Legendary England pacer James Anderson, who retired from international cricket in July 2024 after an illustrious career, is now setting his sights on the Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States. This move comes as Anderson, with 704 Test wickets to his name, seeks to re-enter the white-ball formats.\n\nAnderson, a cornerstone of English cricket for nearly two decades, marked the end of an era with his retirement from Test cricket. However, the 42-year-old fast bowler's passion for the game remains undiminished as he explores opportunities in the T20 format.\n\nAccording to a BBC Sport report, at least one MLC team has shown significant interest in Anderson, who is optimistic about making a return to white-ball cricket. The franchise is reportedly considering adding him to their roster for the third edition of the T20 tournament, scheduled for 2025.\n\nThe MLC, which began in 2023, has already seen participation from cricketing stars like Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, and Glenn Maxwell, enhancing its stature in the cricketing world. The league's expansion to 34 games in 2025 and its recent acquisition of official List A status highlight its growing significance in the global cricket calendar.\n\nFor Anderson, a stint in the MLC could be financially rewarding, with potential earnings around 135,000 euros for a short-term contract. This contrasts sharply with the ECB white-ball contract of 70,000 euros that Jason Roy relinquished to sign a 300,000 euros deal with the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nDespite not having played competitive T20 cricket since 2014, Anderson is confident in his fitness and abilities. Post-retirement, he has engaged in coaching roles, serving as England men's bowling consultant. He has also extended his contract for upcoming winter tours to Pakistan and New Zealand.\n\n\"At the minute, I'm due to go to Pakistan and New Zealand in the winter. Then nothing concrete after that. I'm very new to this, I'm still learning as we go. It's partly me trying to figure out if this is where I want to go with the next stage of my career and also for them to figure out if I'm any good at it as well,\" Anderson told Sky Sports."

        "body": "New Delhi: At least one Major League Cricket franchise is keen to have James Anderson in its ranks for the upcoming 2025 season, which could lead to the return of the former England pacer’s return to T20 cricket after a decade.\n\nThe right-arm seamer retired from England duty in July after picking up 704 wickets in 188 Tests, becoming the first pacer to reach the 700-mark in red-ball cricket.\n\nHis international career stretched for over two decades for which he stopped playing white-ball cricket in 2014 when he played for Lancashire in the NatWest Blast final for Lancashire while his last T20I game was in 2009.\n\nThe 42-year-old recently said he still is fit enough to play on and is open to playing in white-ball cricket, which might have made the unnamed MLC franchise interested, a BBC report said.\n\n“Senior figures with at least one MLC team have had their interest pricked by Anderson’s comments last month about a return to white-ball cricket,” it was written in the report, which added that Anderson could fetch £135,000 (approximately Rs 1.49 crore) from the short stint.\n\nMLC has attracted some top names including Australia’s Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head to the Unites States for its second edition this year and will expand to 34 games from 19 in its third edition next year.\n\nAfter retiring as the most successful pacer in Test cricket, Anderson became England’s pace-bowling mentor and has reaffirmed his commitment to that role during the series against Pakistan in October and during the Test series in New Zealand in December.\n\nMLC is backed by influential names that include Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella and desires to rope in some of England’s top stars to the tournament."

        "body": "In a move that’s stirring the cricketing world, James Anderson, England’s legendary fast bowler, is reportedly in the sights of a Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise. At 42, with a career that has seen him amass 704 Test wickets, Anderson’s potential venture into the MLC could mark a significant chapter not just for him but for cricket’s expansion in the USA.\n\nA New Frontier for James Anderson:\n\nHaving retired from international cricket, Anderson’s interest in the MLC reflects his enduring passion for the game. The MLC, aiming to popularize cricket in America, represents an exciting new challenge for Anderson, who has primarily focused on Test cricket over the past decade.\n\nFinancial Incentive:\n\nThe offer of 1.49 crore INR for a short stint underscores the financial allure of franchise cricket. For Anderson, this could be more than just money; it’s a chance to engage with cricket in a new format and environment, potentially extending his playing career or transitioning into a coaching role.\n\nImpact on MLC:\n\nAnderson’s involvement would undoubtedly elevate the MLC’s profile. His experience and skill could mentor younger players, enhance team strategies, and attract more fans and investors to the league, accelerating its growth trajectory.\n\nStrategic Move for Cricket in the USA:\n\nThe MLC’s ambition to expand to ten teams by 2025 indicates a strategic push towards making cricket a mainstream sport in America. Anderson’s participation could be a catalyst in this mission, bringing his expertise in swing bowling to conditions that might favor such skills.\n\nFan and Cricket Community Reaction:\n\nThe news has sparked a mix of reactions. While many celebrate Anderson’s willingness to explore new avenues, there’s nostalgia about his Test cricket days. However, his move could inspire a new generation of cricketers in the USA, showing that cricket careers can have multiple phases.\n\nChallenges Ahead:\n\nAnderson’s last T20 match was over a decade ago, which might pose challenges in adapting to the fast-paced T20 format. However, his cricketing acumen and fitness could well see him thrive, especially with the shorter format’s emphasis on strategy and experience.\n\nA Broader Perspective:\n\nBeyond Anderson’s personal journey, this move highlights cricket’s global aspirations. The MLC, with its growing stature, could become a significant platform for cricketers worldwide, offering opportunities for those looking to extend or transition their careers.\n\nJames Anderson’s potential stint in the MLC isn’t just about playing cricket; it’s about contributing to the sport’s growth in new markets, mentoring, and perhaps, discovering new talents. As the cricketing world watches, Anderson’s decision could set a precedent for how retired or retiring stars engage with the game’s future.\n\nThis development in Anderson’s career, if realized, could be a testament to his love for cricket, his adaptability, and his role in shaping the sport’s future landscape. Whether for the money, the challenge, or the love of the game, Anderson’s potential move to the MLC is more than just a career choice; it’s a statement on cricket’s evolving narrative."

A team in the Major League Cricket (MLC) has expressed their desire and enquired about the availability of the star.\n\nAnd if things go right, Anderson might be in USA next season to take part in the third edition of the Major League Cricket. A team from the MLC is willing to explore if the English star who retired from Test cricket earlier this summer would be interested to play the franchise cricket.\n\nJames Anderson to set sail over the Pacific?\n\nAlbeit it would be a very short stint, but the veteran could be earning around 1.49cr INR from his stay in USA. Quite a few stars have shared their trade in the USA. One of the biggest stars in the mixes was Australia Cricket Team captain Pat Cummins who is slated to plat with San Francisco Unicorns till 2027.\n\nNot just the Aussie skipper other star players like Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Steve Smith has also played in MLC. Now it remains to be seen if the English veteran sets sail over the Pacific. Anderson last played a T20I match a decade ago, back in 2014. Against West Indies he played the first Test before hanging up his boots. But Jimmy Anderson joined the coaching staff and has a contract that runs till September."

The right-arm pacer ended his cricket journey with 704 wickets which is the highest for a pace bowler.

The team in question isn’t known yet but the amount offered is considerably high.\n\nWeeks after retiring from the game, James Anderson while speaking to BBC had said “There’s definitely bit of intrigue with the shorter formats because I haven’t played any franchise stuff before. Watching The Hundred this year, the ball has swung around, it makes me feel I could do a job there”\n\nThe former England pacer also said to BBC “I know it’s a while since I played it (white-ball format) and my age will get brought up again but I feel I’ll be good enough to play form of cricket”\n\nDhruv Jurel recollects James Anderson sledging him in Ranchi\n\nJames Anderson was part of the England squad that toured India earlier this year. During the 4th Test in Ranchi, Dhruv Jurel scored a brilliant 90 that helped India win the Test and also take the series.\n\nThe young wicketkeeper and batter was a guest on Jatin Sapru’s YouTube show. The Indian star said that James Anderson had sledged him hard during the game. “The next match was in Ranchi. Everything was going well, and suddenly, a flurry of wickets fell. England players were relaxed and were playing for fun. Then Anderson came to me and said, 'I've seen your videos, this is not your game.' Said Dhruv Jurel."
