        "title": "IPL 2025: Ricky Ponting becomes Punjab Kings’ head coach",
        "date": "Wed Sep 18 10:49:02 2024",
        "body": "Not even an entire season has passed, and Ricky Ponting is back in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as head coach of yet another franchise. The Punjab Kings (PBKS) have roped in the Australian, who formerly coached the Delhi Capitals (DC) for seven years and the Mumbai Indians (MI) for four years in the IPL.\n\nPonting was earlier released from his role as Capitals’ head coach in July this year. Right after that, the Australian won the Major League Cricket (MLC) title with the Washington Freedom, with compatriot Steve Smith as captain of the side.\n\nApart from his commitments in the IPL and MLC, Ponting’s BBL side, Hobart Hurricanes, have kept him on their payroll as the team’s strategic head since Big Bash League (BBL) 2021.\n\nEarlier today, Kings posted a cryptic message on X (formerly Twitter), fueling rumours that the former Australian captain was in their sights and that something interesting might happen.\n\n\"We are delighted to have Ricky on to guide and build our team for the next 4 seasons. His experience is crucial to help us develop a squad to deliver on-field success. His insights from his international coaching stints and as a television pundit would be vital in identifying talent ahead of the mega auction this year. His ability to develop cricketing and leadership skills will play a crucial role in our success,” said Satish Menon, Kings CEO, about the appointment.\n\nPonting added, \"I am grateful to Punjab Kings for presenting me with the opportunity to be the new Head Coach. I am excited to take up the new challenge. I had great conversations with the owners and the management about the way forward and was truly elated to see the alignment of our visions for the team. We all want to repay the fans who have stayed with the franchise over the years and we promise that they will see a much different Punjab Kings going forward.\"\n\nSo far, Punjab Kings have not won the IPL and Ponting, who replaced Trevor Bayliss as in-charge of the side, already has his task cut out."

        "date": "Tue Sep 17 07:26:05 2024",
        "body": "James Anderson, England’s all-time leading Test wicket-taker, has become an unexpected target for Major League Cricket (MLC), with discussions underway about his potential participation in the U.S. T20 tournament next year.\n\nAccording to BBC Sport, senior figures associated with at least one MLC team have been intrigued by Anderson’s recent comments about a possible return to white-ball cricket.\n\nThe 42-year-old fast bowler, who retired from international Test cricket in July, could be set to join the third edition of the MLC, which is scheduled for 2025.\n\nAnderson’s impressive career, marked by 704 Test wickets, has positioned him as one of cricket’s all-time greats. Despite his retirement from international Test cricket following the first Test against the West Indies at Lord’s, Anderson has continued to remain closely linked with the game.\n\nHe joined the England backroom team immediately after his retirement and is still on a central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) until the end of September.\n\nIn an intriguing turn of events, the unnamed MLC franchise is reportedly exploring whether Anderson would be interested in a short stint with the league.\n\nAnderson could potentially earn around £135,000 for his participation, which represents a significant financial incentive and a chance to showcase his skills in a different format.\n\nThe MLC has already attracted high-profile players in its previous editions. For the 2024 tournament, notable names included Australia captain Pat Cummins, who has a lucrative contract with the San Francisco Unicorns that extends until 2027.\n\nThe Washington Freedom team, coached by Ricky Ponting, featured Australian stars Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head, and triumphed in this year’s competition.\n\nAnderson’s potential involvement in MLC would mark a new chapter in his illustrious career.\n\nAlthough he has transitioned to a role as a fast-bowling mentor for England’s Test series against Pakistan in October and plans to join the team for their tour of New Zealand in December, the allure of T20 cricket and the opportunity to play in the U.S. could be a compelling proposition for the veteran paceman.\n\nAs Anderson continues his contributions to English cricket, his potential move to MLC would not only highlight the growing appeal of the T20 format but also underscore the league’s ability to attract cricketing legends.\n\nWith discussions reportedly ongoing, the cricket world will be watching closely to see if one of England’s most celebrated bowlers will indeed make his mark in the American T20 league."
