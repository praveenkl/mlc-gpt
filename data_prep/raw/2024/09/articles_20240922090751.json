        "body": "England’s greatest ever bowler James Anderson could make a comeback in Major League Cricket after attracting interest from US franchises.\n\nAnderson was ushered into international retirement by England chiefs earlier this summer but is considering prolonging his career by playing lucrative white-ball competitions.\n\nThe 42-year-old seamer, England’s all-time record wicket-taker in Test cricket, could earn £130,000 from a stint in Major League Cricket.\n\nThe six-team competition completed its second season in July and featured international stars such as Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, Trent Boult, Travis Head and Faf du Plessis.\n\nOwners of Major League Cricket franchises include the proprietors of Indian Premier League sides Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings.\n\nAt least one team is reported by the BBC to have been alerted to Anderson’s potential availability by comments he made last month following his international retirement.\n\n“I might be in a bit of denial because I’m well aware I won’t play for England again, but I’ve still not made a decision on my actual cricket career,” he said.\n\n“There’s definitely a bit of intrigue with the shorter formats because I’ve not played any franchise stuff before. Watching The Hundred this year, seeing the ball swing around, it makes me feel like I could do a job there.\n\n“I know it’s a while since I played it and my age will get brought up again but I really feel I’ll be good enough to play that form of cricket.”\n\nAnderson took 18 wickets in 19 T20 appearances for England, as well as 269 in 194 one-day internationals.\n\nHis 704 wickets in 188 Tests is a record for an England player and behind only Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan and Aussie great Shane Warne in the all-time list.\n\nHe is currently part of the England coaching team and is expected to travel to Pakistan next month and New Zealand in December as a fast-bowling mentor."

        "body": "James Anderson, the top wicket-taker among Test cricket pacers with 704 wickets over nearly two decades, surpassed Glenn McGrath's record of 563 wickets in 2018. Renowned for his swing and accuracy, Anderson recently retired at age 41 and is considering playing franchise cricket, potentially Major League Cricket in the USA.\n\nJames Anderson (X Photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: James Anderson who is the leading wicket taker among the pacers in test cricket has scalped the wickets of batters for almost two decades. In his 35o innings of Test career, he has scalped 704 wicket to become the only pacer to take more than 700 wickets.\n\nPrior to this Australian great, Glenn Mcgrath was the leading wicket taker with 563 wickets but Anderson broke his record in 2018. Anderson who is the first bowler from England to cross 500 wickets mark, is precisely known for his swing and accuracy. With his swing, he has troubled even the greatest like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Virat Kohli. Even Shubman Gill, who is the upcoming star for India's batting order has also struggled against James Anderson.\n\nJames Anderson started his England one-day career in 2002-03 with just three one-day games for Lancashire under his belt. He stepped in as cover for Andy Caddick during the series in Australia. Despite not having a name or number on his shirt, Anderson impressed with a ten-over spell that allowed only 12 runs in the intense heat of Adelaide.\n\nThis performance earned him a spot in the World Cup squad, where he continued to shine by delivering a match winning spell against Pakistan. However, he faced a challenging moment in a last-over situation against Australia. Anderson's rapid rise in international cricket during this period marked the beginning of his notable career.\n\nJames Anderson, who recently retired at the age of 41, remains enthusiastic about cricket and is considering joining franchise cricket. Anderson might play in Major League Cricket in the USA, which includes notable players such as Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, and Nicholas Pooran.\n\nShaun Pollock, a South African pacer with 421 test wickets, once discussed what makes Anderson's bowling stand out.\n\nAccording to Pollock, other seamers would keep the seam of the ball straight, but James Anderson tried to create a slight wobble, leaving the batter clueless about what the ball would do once it pitched.\n\n\"A key factor is that the swing begins from 20 metres away. It starts to swing, and for the next 10 metres, you can see it moving through the air, whereas seam movement happens just 5 metres from the batter. Once the ball moves, the batter has no chance to react.\" Pollock continued.\n\nit's impossible to react when you are facing jimmy anderson\n\n\"You can see the guys (batter) trying to respond. With swing through the air, you can watch the ball and judge whether to leave it or if it's coming in, you must play it. But when the ball comes down straight and then moves off the pitch, what can you do? It's impossible to react,\" Pollock added.\n\nJames Anderson was close to reaching another significant milestone in Test cricket. He was just four wickets away from becoming the second-highest wicket-taker in Test matches. Currently, Anderson is contributing to England's cricket team as a bowling mentor during this Test summer.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"

        "body": "England's all-time highest wicket-taker James Anderson could take part in the upcoming edition of Major League Cricket (MLC) according to a report on BBC. Anderson recently hinted at a return to white-ball cricket following his international retirement and one of those options could be the franchise T20 league in the USA.\n\nAccording to the same report, an unnamed franchise is checking whether Anderson would consider taking up a deal for the third season of the tournament. The MLC began in 2023 with 19-game season, but the league is looking to expand to 34 games from 2025. The tournament was granted an official List A status in May.\n\nAnderson's last T20 game came in 2014 for Lancashire, with him dedicating the next decade to focus on red-ball cricket. He ended his career with 704 Test wickets - the third highest in the format's history.\n\nSome of the league's influential supporters like Microsoft chief Satya Nadella had earlier expressed their desire to get some of the top England players into the MLC. Anderson could very well be one of them.\n\nIt is understood that Anderson could earn 135,000 Pounds during the tournament. Anderson could be yet another high-profile addition to the tournament that already has Pat Cummins, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head.\n\nMoreover, former World Cup winners Liam Plunkett and Jason Roy are also part of the tournament. Soon after his retirement, Anderson joined England's backroom staff as their fast-bowling mentor. He has expressed his desire to stick around with the team for the series against Pakistan and New Zealand later this year."

        "date": "Fri Sep 20 20:22:24 2024",
        "body": "Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting didn't take much time in deciding his next organisation in the IPL after parting ways with the Delhi Capitals following a seven-season stint from 2018 to 2024. Ponting has signed a four-year contract with the Punjab Kings, the longest in the franchise's history considering the 2014 finalists have had 10 coaches prior to the ex-Delhi Capitals head coach. Since Ponting is coming off winning the Major League Cricket (MLC) with the Washington Freedom, it will keep him in good stead given there's a mega auction coming up and it will give him a chance to start from scratch.\n\nPonting admitted that 'project Punjab' attracted him given there were a couple of more offers after he parted ways with the Capitals. \"Yes, I was talking to a few teams, but it was \"Project Punjab\" which attracted me. It is a team that hasn't had a lot of success over a long period of time, a team that's changed coaches a lot, so I saw it as a challenge,\" Ponting told ESPNCricinfo.\n\nPonting said that he was impressed with a few of the youngsters from the Punjab side last season and with a four-season deal he has with the Kings, he hopes to win a title, which he couldn't with the Capitals in seven years. Obviously that was one rationale why he wasn't retained as the coach as Capitals reached playoffs in three seasons out of seven including a final in 2020 but Ponting revealed it wasn't the only reason.\n\n\"One thing I have noticed a bit this year is, a lot of the IPL franchises, because they have so many teams now across most T20 leagues, they are looking to have almost full-time coaching staff, which was one of the things that was the undoing with me with DC,\" Ponting added. \"They wanted more time and to have an India-based coach on the ground there for most of the year. I couldn't commit to that. That's the way it seems that a lot of the teams are going and it makes perfect sense.\"\n\nPonting said that he was disappointed with the way his tenure with the Capitals ended as he was able to create a really good environment with the side. However, he couldn't commit to a full-time involvement, which is one of the reasons he hasn't taken up an international coaching job."
