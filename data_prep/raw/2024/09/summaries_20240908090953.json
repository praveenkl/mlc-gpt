        "text": "Rushil Ugarkar, a 21-year-old cricketer, has made a name for himself in the MLC, playing for MI New York. Despite suffering from food poisoning and being eight pounds lighter, Ugarkar delivered a brilliant spell, regularly clocking speeds of early 130s in his two games. He was drafted as the franchise's rookie pick and got to play alongside renowned bowlers like Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and Anrich Nortje. Ugarkar credited former Sri Lanka cricketer Lasith Malinga for helping him find his way and teaching him new things about cricket. He particularly appreciated working with Malinga and the video analyst to prepare for matches, including studying match-ups to bowl effectively against opponents like Faf."
