While this deal was always in the making, considering that Freedom had a partnership with New South Wales (NSW), a team that Smith represents.\n\nEarlier last year, in a promotional event, Smith had insisted that he would be looking forward to being part of cricket in the United States of America (USA), hinting at a MLC deal. Smith will join the likes of Moises Henriques, Ben Dwarshuis, Josh Philippe and Tanveer Sangha, who all represented Freedom in the inaugural edition of the competition.\n\n\"As a New South Wales boy, the partnership the Freedom has with my home state means a lot to me,\" Smith said in a promotional video. \"Cricket in Australia has a rich history and I look forward to being part of taking cricket to the United States of America.\"\n\nIt will not be the first time that Smith has played cricket in the North American region, after playing an edition of the Global T20 League in Canada shortly before making his international comeback following the ban."

Bravo, on Friday, September 27, was named as the mentor of the Knight Riders group, which includes franchises in the IPL, Caribbean Premier League, Major League Cricket and ILT20.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a video message, Dwayne Bravo also thanked the Chennai Super Kings for 'blessing' him in the next chapter of his career as coach. Bravo retired from the IPL after the 2021 season and worked with the Super Kings as their bowling coach in the IPL 2022 and IPL 2023 seasons.\n\n\"To all the Knight Riders fans and all DJ Bravo fans around the world, first, I want to say thank you. A big, big thank you to the Knight Riders family and the management for trusting me, giving me the opportunity to be a part of a very special franchise. I want to say a big thank you also to the management and staff of the Chennai Super Kings for giving me the blessings to move on and carry on in my journey. I believe I always wanted to be in a position where I could inspire the next generation of champions,\" Bravo said in a post shared by the Knight Riders.\n\n\"So now, with that being said. I look forward to doing my best and I look forward to doing great things with the team in Purple.\n\n\"To our boss SRK (Shah Rukh Khan), as he always says, we are going to enjoy, we are going to have fun. We are going to party and we are going to win. From the Champion, thank you very much. Korbo Lorbo Jeetbo, Amir KKR,\" Bravo said.\n\nBravo's appointment as the mentor of the Knight Riders came hours after he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on Friday.\n\nBravo made his IPL debut for the Mumbai Indians and went on to form a long-standing relationship with the Super Kings. He won four titles with CSK in various capacities and went on to become one of the trusted lieutenants of MS Dhoni. While has not played for KKR in the IPL, Bravo has a long association with the Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nBravo will replace Gautam Gambhir as the mentor of the Knight Riders. Gambhir, who played a key role in KKR winning the IPL title in 2024, took over the job of the Indian national senior men's team's head coach in July.\n\nA five-time CPL champion, he won three titles with the Trinbago Knight Riders, including back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018, and led the St. Kitts and Nevis Patriots to victory in 2021. His success extended globally with multiple IPL, PSL, and BBL trophies to his name, solidifying his place as one of the greatest T20 players of all time.\n\nBravo's final statistics reflect his dominance in the game: 631 wickets, the most by any player in T20 history, along with 177 first-class wickets and 271 List-A dismissals in a career that spanned over 900 matches across formats."
