        "body": "Table of Contents\n\nThe second season of America’s marquee T20 league, Major League Cricket (MLC) will commence on America’s Independence Day i.e., July 4. The organizers had to start the tournament in July as the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 is expected to be played in June and will conclude just four days before the start of MLC. The T20 World Cup will be hosted by West Indies and the USA.\n\nThe first season of the MLC was concluded early due to international window constraints. The matches in the first season were played in the round-robin format. However, this time around, it is being planned to keep the league in a home-away double round-robin league format. Major League Cricket’s first season saw six teams competing against each other.\n\nMLC has not disclosed the venues for the second season. It is understood that there are possibilities that MLC could add two more venues for season 2. Apart from the Grand Prairie and Morrisville venues, Major League Cricket looks keen on leveraging the pop-up venue in Long Island, NY with a 34000 seating capacity set to be erected by the ICC for the T20 World Cup. The upcoming facility at George Mason University has been identified by the MLC for warm-up matches of the World Cup.\n\nAlso Read: Mohammed Shami Ruled Out Of India’s Test Series, Deepak Chahar To Miss ODI Series Due To Family Emergency\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) Provides A Perfect Platform For American Cricket\n\n“The tremendous success of the inaugural Major League Cricket season provides a perfect platform to propel American cricket to even greater heights in 2024,” said Justin Geale, Tournament Director, Major League Cricket. “We expect to see even more world-class players participating in season two of Major League Cricket, creating an incredible summer for the sport in America along with the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.”\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC attracted some top signings at large signing amounts surpassing established leagues like the Big Bash League and the SA20 League in average salary per league game. The second season of Major League Cricket is expected to retain most of the white-ball players that featured in the last season as the window stands clear of any white-ball cricket scheduled for teams like England, Australia, New Zealand, West Indies, and Pakistan.\n\nMI New York won the inaugural season of the Major League Cricket and the franchise will be looking to win another season. Nicholas Pooran led the team in the finals and scored a brilliant ton to take his team over the line against the Seattle Orcas in the finals.\n\nAlso Read: Suryakumar Yadav Reacts With Broken-Heart Emoji To Hardik Pandya’s Announcement As MI Skipper For IPL 2024"

        "date": "Sun May 19 06:00:00 2024",
        "body": "The anticipation is growing for the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) as the American professional T20 competition looks to capitalize on a successful debut. The upcoming season is set to kick off on July 5 with a double header between defending champions MI New York and Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season’s final. The tournament will conclude on July 27, with the latter stages overlapping with England’s Hundred competition. MLC officials initially aimed for a mid-June to mid-July schedule to avoid clashes, but the T20 World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S, ended in late June this year.\n\nMLC has seen high demand for pre-sale tickets since announcing the season’s schedule, indicating a growing enthusiasm for cricket in America. Chief Executive Vijay Srinivasan expressed delight in providing fans across the nation the opportunity to witness top-tier cricket live in their own backyard. The success of the first season has set a foundation for MLC to establish itself as one of the premier T20 leagues in the world. The goal is to continue expanding the sport in the United States and engage the community, both as fans and participants.\n\nAttendance numbers for last season were impressive, with around 70,000 fans turning out for the tournament played at venues such as the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the Church Street Park in Morrisville. The second season will see an expansion of six games, with teams set to play seven matches in the group stages leading up to four playoff games. While MLC officials aim to eventually have a home-and-away season, this will only be feasible once all franchises have home grounds. Player wages in the league will remain competitive, with top players earning $175,000 for a minimum of five games.\n\nMLC has been able to attract marquee Australian signings, such as Steve Smith, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head, due to Australia having no international commitments after the T20 World Cup. The league exceeded financial targets in its debut season, generating revenues of $8 million. The success of the league’s first season can be attributed in part to its novelty factor, but there is optimism that MLC will continue to grow in its second season both on and off the field. With momentum from a historic T20 World Cup and a strong fan base, MLC is poised for another successful season as it aims to establish itself as a premier T20 league in the world."
