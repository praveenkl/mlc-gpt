        "date": "Thu Jul 25 15:30:00 2024",
        "body": "When the first season of Major League Cricket came to a close, the Seattle Orcas showed their class. This year, the result was much different for the team of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSeattle fell in its final match of MLC 2 to the Texas Super Kings, losing by 37 runs.\n\nIt capped a horrid season for the green and gray, as the Orcas managed just two points and finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nSeattle is very South African heavy with its international players, who are coming off a world cup semifinal appearance. To say there were tired legs, would be stating the obvious. “Most of our pros came over straight from the world cup. Even if they won’t agree, they looked a little bit exhausted,” said Orcas All-Rounder Harmeet Singh.\n\nSome of the best South African cricketers have been playing without more than a week’s break for over four months.\n\nThis season just wasn’t to be for the Orcas. Like Seattle’s other bat-to-ball franchise, the Mariners, the Orcas could not put consistent runs on the board.\n\nOver the course of the seven games played this season, Seattle batted second in three of them and chased runs successfully in their lone victory. But when the Orcas were required to put up a high number, Seattle continuously dropped the ball.\n\nWhen opening with the batting, the Orcas have won just one game in their two years of existence. It was all the way back on July 15, 2023, in a win over San Fransisco. But since then, Seattle has lost seven in a row when opening with the paddle.\n\nDespite quite literally nothing bouncing the way of the Orcas in year two, in the final match there looked to be some positives. Ayan Desai made his MLC and Orcas debut taking the ball to start the first over.\n\nWith his first ball he took the wicket of a top-class cricketer in Devon Conway via leg before wicket. That ball was later named the play of the game and was the start of a great first match for Desai.\n\nHe finished with 2 wickets and 30 runs, and an economy of 7.50 which was the third lowest of all bowlers in the game.\n\nIt was just a bleak day with the bat for the Orcas after holding the Super Kings to a pretty manageable 177 after the first innings.\n\nSeattle knew it was going to have to work hard after its top run-scorer Ryan Rickleton was dismissed for a golden duck for the second straight match. Rickleton looked to be the bright spot of the Orca’s 2024 season scoring a century and spent a lot of time on the top of the run scoring table, but in his last two matches never saw a second ball.\n\nNo Orca scored more than 26 runs (Quentin de Kock 19 balls), which pales in comparison to the Super Kings’ three players who scored over 29 in the match."

It also hosted games during the International Cricket Council’s Men’s T20 World Cup.\n\nOn Wednesday, about 200 Grand Prairie ISD coaches and physical education teachers were invited to learn more about the game at Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nThe idea is for them to eventually go back to their schools and teach their students.\n\n\"It has been interesting so far,\" said PE teacher Paige Hale. \"It’s really nice to learn from experts because you can tell these guys really know what they’re doing. And we just appreciate them spending time with us and teaching us new skills. And they’re sending us home with equipment that we can use in our schools, which is incredible.\"\n\nHale said she needs more practice before she is able to instruct her students. But eventually, she hopes the kids will have fun with it.\n\nWednesday’s event was hosted by the ICC, whose goal is to have 1 million young people playing the sport in the United States by 2028."

        "date": "Thu Aug  1 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES: After a momentous T20 World Cup co-hosted by the US, marked by a $30 million cricket stadium in New York along with an underdog performance by the national team, hopes are high for a pivotal second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nThis year’s cricket tournament did receive significant exposure with coverage in media institutions like The New York Times, CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nNo one thinks it will become mainstream in the US but the sleeping giant -- with cricket by some metrics the second most popular sport in the world -- has finally awakened, reported international media. It came just before the much-anticipated second season of MLC, the lucrative professional T20 league in the US luring top players around the world.\n\nMLC has been able to secure major sponsorship deals, highlighted by Cognizant — a multinational information technology services and consulting company — becoming its first title sponsor. Salary caps for teams are to remain the same, but top players will still be handsomely remunerated and earn around $175,000 for a minimum of five games — rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nWhile Indian players are not allowed to play outside of the IPL, a slew of stars will play in this season’s MLC — many from Australia highlighted by San Francisco’s marquee signing of Pat Cummins to a four-year deal. Ahead of this season, MLC received official T20 league status with tournament playing records counted towards format statistics.\n\nWhile things are looking rosy in American cricket, there has been familiar warring behind the scenes with governing body USA Cricket amid continual turmoil after a spate of resignations and chief executive Dr. Noor Murad having his contract terminated earlier this year.\n\nUSA Cricket sanctions MLC, which is administered by American Cricket Enterprises after signing a 50-year commercial rights agreement in 2019. There are plans to expand MLC, with Chicago and Atlanta touted as possible new franchises amid a longer tournament earmarked to be played over much of June and July moving forward.\n\nThe 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup is done and dusted, ending the latest chapter of cricket’s onerous venture into the United States. America, where cricket has struggled to gain mainstream visibility for more than a century, hosted 16 of the tournament’s group-stage matches last month, while the remaining Super Eight games and knockouts took place in the Caribbean.\n\nThe T20 World Cup’s promotion through local media was headlined by a full-page advertisement in the New York Times that featured the Statue of Liberty raising a cricket bat. Olympic champion Usain Bolt opened the tournament at New York’s Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, a pop-up venue built specifically for the event, while former Indian all-rounder Yuvraj Singh appeared on NBC’s Good Morning America for a six-minute segment.\n\n“A lot of Americans are walking in and they’re asking questions about the sport,” Ali Zar, a cricket store owner in New York, told BBC Sport ahead of the tournament. “I was born in Pakistan, so I know about this sport. My kids are born here, other kids are born here. They are starting to ask questions about this sport.”\n\nMajor American publications, including Bleacher Report and CBS News, celebrated the win on their social media channels — the match headlined a segment on ESPN’s SportsCenter, while the New York Post and New York Times began featuring the T20 World Cup prominently on their websites. Even the White House took notice — National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby congratulated the American team after they qualified for the Super Eight stage, while US Senate majority leader Chuck tweeted about the “incredible upset” against Pakistan.\n\nMeanwhile, the Knight Riders Group (KRG), backed by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside actor Juhi Chawla and businessman Jay Mehta, is investing in a 10,000-capacity cricket stadium near Los Angeles. Located at a 15-acre land parcel in Great Park, Irvine, Southern California, some 40 miles from downtown Los Angeles, the plan is driven by Major League Cricket (MLC). The org has revealed that an exclusive negotiating agreement with the city of Irvine to move forward with lease negotiations and design approvals has been approved. The investment in the stadium is likely to be in the range of $30 million, Variety understands.\n\nKRG are owners of the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the lucrative Indian Premier League cricket tournament and Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League."

        "body": "Jason Roy has given up his England contract in order to play in this summer’s first edition of Major League Cricket.\n\nRoy made a request to the ECB to be released to play in the US franchise tournament, which England have granted on the condition that the World Cup-winning opener relinquish the remainder of his incremental deal.\n\nThe 32-year-old will not miss any England matches in order to play in the tournament, with Jos Buttler’s side not in white-ball action this summer until late-August, but under the terms of their contract the ECB could have asked him to rest during the gap between the Vitality Blast and Hundred. Roy’s decision will not effect his future selection prospects, with the batter still England’s incumbent opener in ODI cricket ahead of their World Cup defence in India this autumn.\n\nIn a statement, Roy insisted representing England remained his chief priority.\n\n“I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will ‘walk away from England’,” Roy said. “Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer. I hope to play for England for many more years.”\n\nRoy is set to become the first English player to sign up to the new competition, which takes place in Texas during the final two weeks of July, with reports suggesting he is likely to turn out for the LA Knight Riders, one of six newly-formed teams, four of which are at least partially backed by IPL owners.\n\nRoy has just returned from a stint with Kolkata Knight Riders at the IPL and is set to make his first Surrey appearance of the season in Thursday’s Blast opener against Middlesex at Lord’s.\n\nIt is understood that Roy will still be available for the entirety of Surrey’s Blast campaign, including Finals Day on July 15 should the county get that far, before flying to the US and then returning in time to play for Oval Invincibles in the Hundred.\n\nRoy was demoted to an incremental deal last October, having been dropped by England’s T20 side ahead of their successful World Cup campaign, and will now forgo the remainder of his salary up until the contract was due to expire at the end of September.\n\nIncremental contracts are worth between £60,000 and £70,000 a year and Roy could earn more than twice that amount for just two weeks’ work in the US."

        "body": "Sunil Gavaskar was unhappy with the quality drop in the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC). The Washington Freedom defeated the San Francisco Unicorns to lift the trophy at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\n\nGavaskar was a part of the commentary panel during Major League Cricket 2024. He was disappointed with the quality of the league despite the presence of several international stars.\n\nHe also highlighted the poor crowd turnout compared to the first edition and demanded that players’ participation be restricted to three leagues instead of many to ensure quality cricket.\n\n“The crowd was not there this time. Maybe it was due to fatigue as the USA hosted the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 along with the West Indies. The cricket also lacked quality. There were ordinary players in the franchises. The international stars were also a little casual,” Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar.\n\n“Nobody wants the cricketers’ source of income to decrease, but I feel players should be restricted to three leagues of their choice. IPL is the best tournament in the world, and the players should be allowed to choose other T20 tournaments,” he added.\n\nGavaskar also noted that players represent multiple franchises of different owners.\n\n“Players are playing for one franchise in the IPL and turning up for the rival IPL franchise in the other leagues. It is understandable if the franchise they compete for in the IPL doesn’t have a team in the other T20 leagues, but it is odd to see them wearing a jersey of a rival IPL franchise in other leagues,” he concluded.\n\nMarcus Stoinis scored a hundred for Lucknow Super Giants against the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in IPL 2024, but a few months later, he represented CSK’s sister franchise, Texas Super Kings (TSK), in the Major League Cricket (MLC)."

Notably, the MI New York won the inaugural season and were crowned the maiden MLC champions.

Whil Travis Head has gone about the business in his usual way, Smith has showed dynamism in his batting. He has taken the attack to the opposition or played defensively as per the need of the game situaton. Corey Anderson will be eager to get rid of Smith as soon as possible. The best weapon for the Unicorns could be Pat Cummins. The Aussie speedster has dismissed Smith three times in 10 deliveries conceding only six runs.\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk vs Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk is known for his ultra aggressive batting style. Although he has not got going in this tournament, he can prove to be very dangerous if gets going. Steve Smith will be keen to see the back of this young Australian batter as soon as possible. It is quite evident that Saurabh Netravalkar, who has done a great job for his team in this tournament will be bowling to JFK early in the innings with the new ball. With the left-arm angle, Netravalkar can prove to be dangerous for Fraser-McGurk. Also, the numbers speak in favour of the left-arm medium pacer.\n\nGlenn Maxwell vs Pat Cummins"

        "body": "Under Steven Smith’s captaincy, the Washington Freedom secured the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 championship with a commanding 96-run win over the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. Smith’s strategic leadership played a crucial role in their dominant performance throughout the match. The Freedom’s impressive victory highlighted their exceptional skills and teamwork, as they effectively outplayed the Unicorns to claim the title. Smith’s influence and the team’s overall excellence were key to their triumphant season.\n\nWashington Freedom Maiden Title Win Against San Francisco Unicorns:\n\nWashington Freedom clinched their first Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 title with a decisive 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. Glenn Maxwell‘s stellar batting performance played a key role, while Marco Jansen dismantled the Unicorns’ chase, claiming three wickets including both openers. This win solidified Freedom’s reputation as the standout team of the season.\n\nHaving secured five group stage victories and advancing directly to the final after beating the Unicorns in the Qualifier, Freedom’s dominant display continued. A crucial 83-run standoff 39 balls between Steven Smith and Maxwell helped them amass 121 runs in the latter part of their innings.\n\nSteven Smith overcame a slow start during the powerplay to score a robust 88 off 52 balls, including six sixes. After struggling with just 10 runs off 12 balls in the sixth over, he accelerated to a half-century off 34 balls. Smith ended the season as the joint second-highest run-scorer, tied with Travis Head, amassing 336 runs at a strike rate of 148.67. His innings gained momentum with Andries Gous’s support, although the match became tense when Haris Rauf dismissed Rachin Ravindra, leaving Freedom at 86 for 3.\n\nSmith and Glenn Maxwell then shifted the balance, with Maxwell finding his form towards the end of the season. They scored 28 runs in the 13th over against Juanoy Drysdale. Smith showcased his flair with a stunning scoop for six off Rauf and was approaching a century when he was dismissed by a top edge off Pat Cummins.\n\nSmith’s T20I career seems to be winding down after his World Cup omission and exclusion from the September squad facing Scotland and England, as selectors shift focus to emerging talent. Despite Maxwell’s dismissal by Josh Inglis in the next over, Freedom still managed to exceed 200 runs.\n\nThe Unicorns’ chase never gained momentum. Jake Fraser-McGurk’s underwhelming tournament ended when he was dismissed by Jansen, leaving him with just 81 runs at an average of 11.57. Both Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Allen fell during the powerplay, setting a challenging task. Sherfane Rutherford, after being dropped, was brilliantly caught by Ian Holland, and the rest of the batting collapsed under the mounting run rate.\n\nRicky Ponting About the Maiden Win:\n\nFreedom’s win awarded Ricky Ponting his first coaching title shortly after his exit from the Delhi Capitals. This achievement came just weeks after leaving his previous role, demonstrating Ponting’s ability to quickly make a mark in his new position. His successful transition underscores his coaching expertise and impact in leading Freedom to the MLC 2024 championship.\n\nRicky Ponting said, “ What a tournament for the Washington Freedom family! Easily one of the best groups of players, coaches and support staff I’ve ever worked with. The memories will last forever and I can’t wait to do it all again.”"

        "body": "Washington Freedom won their maiden Major League Cricket title with a convincing win over the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas on Sunday. For the second consecutive year, we made it to the Playoffs, showing marked improvement from our loss in the Eliminator last year.\n\nThe team was very consistent this season, topping the points table throughout the league phase of the tournament. We lost just once in the course of nine matches, thanks to several clinical performances from our players.\n\nHere is a look at some of the best individual performances by our players this season.\n\nSteve Smith’s 88 off 52 balls vs SFU\n\nThere are many reasons why this knock against the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas stands at the top of the list. It was the final of MLC 2024, and the in-form Travis Head departed in the second over of the match.\n\nSkipper Steve Smith had to ensure that the scoring rate did not drop while also preventing further wickets from falling. He, along with Andries Gous, kept the scoreboard ticking, frequently finding boundaries.\n\nFrom 27 off 25 balls, Smith shifted gears to bring up his fifty in 34 balls. He scored 61 runs in his last 27 balls as we powered to 207/5, the highest total by any team this season.\n\nSmith added 83 runs with Glenn Maxwell from just 39 balls as we amassed 107 runs in the last eight overs of our innings. Smith had already set the base for a final flourish when he departed in the 17th over for a 52-ball 88, an innings laden with six sixes and seven fours. He deservedly won the Player of the Match award in the final after our 96-run win.\n\nTravis Head’s 77* off 44 balls vs SFU\n\nChasing 146 against the Unicorns in the Qualifier match in Dallas, Travis Head opened up in the third over after settling in. Head smashed three sixes and two fours to score 30 runs off Carmi le Roux’s two overs.\n\nWe raced to 52/1, with Head already on 41 off just 21 balls at the end of the powerplay. There was a quiet phase as we lost two wickets in the next three overs. However, Head returned to form once he reached his half-century, scoring boundaries at will.\n\nHead put together an unbeaten partnership of 85 off just 40 balls for the fourth wicket, making light work of the chase. The southpaw was unbeaten on 77 from 44 balls, with 10 fours and three sixes, as we romped home with a seven-wicket win with 27 balls to spare.\n\nRachin Ravindra 4/11 vs SFU\n\nRachin Ravindra picked up his career-best figures of 4/11 in T20 cricket in the Qualifier of MLC 2024 against San Francisco Unicorns at Dallas, which we won by seven wickets. Coming into the attack after the powerplay, Ravindra dismissed the dangerous Sanjay Krishnamurthi, the top-scorer in the last match between the two sides, off his third ball of the day.\n\nRavindra surprised Krishnamurthi with an arm ball that came in at pace, trapping him in front of the wicket. A wicket maiden to start with and he could not have asked for anything more.\n\nRavindra came back into the attack in the 18th over as Lockie Ferguson got injured after bowling two deliveries. He picked up two more off the next three balls as Haris Rauf holed out in the deep and Carmi le Roux found the timber disturbed.\n\nIn the last over, Ravindra outclassed Hassan Khan as he stepped out looking to force the pace and get some valuable runs. Ravindra bowled it wide and Hassan was caught short of his crease and had to walk back after top-scoring for the Unicorns with 57.\n\nLockie Ferguson 4/26 vs Seattle Orcas\n\nLockie Ferguson had a memorable spell against the Seattle Orcas in our group game at Dallas in MLC 2024 picking up 4/26 against them. Bowling the last over of the powerplay, Ferguson did not have an ideal start getting hit for a six and four in his first three balls.\n\nBut he came back strongly to dismiss Ryan Rickleton who was coming into this game after scoring an unbeaten century in his last match. In his next over, Ferguson bowled Quinton de Kock, who was looking in good nick, as the Orcas were reduced to 44/3.\n\nReturning to complete his spell during the death, Ferguson put the brakes on Orcas with a double strike in the 17th over. He beat the batters with his sheer pace as Imad Wasim nicked to the keeper and Hammad Azam was out leg before wicket.\n\nHe conceded just three runs in the over to finish with impressive figures of 4/26 in four overs. The Orcas were dismissed for 124 and we won the match by five wickets."
