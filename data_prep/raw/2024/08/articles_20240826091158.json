        "body": "Once a sensation in the Indian Premier League, Paul Valthaty has landed a coaching job in the United States. The 40-year-old was appointed as the head coach of the Seattle Thunderbolts in Minor League Cricket - a T20 tournament which is a developmental league for Major League Cricket.\n\n\"Seattle Thunderbolts have just added a big hitter to their lineup—off the field! We’re thrilled to announce that Paul Valthaty, the former Kings XI Punjab sensation, is now steering our ship as the Head Coach,\" the Minor League Cricket side said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nPaul Valthaty began working with youngsters at the Thunderbolts Cricket Academy in Seattle. In a video message, Valthaty said he was excited to share his experience of playing in Mumbai and the Indian Premier League with the budding talents in Seattle.\n\nPaul Valtthaty had announced his retirement from domestic cricket only last year. The 40-year-old made an incredible impact in IPL 2011 for Punjab Kings (then Kings XI Punjab), but failed to replicate that season's success in the following years. The Mumbai cricketer failed to earn an IPL contract after 2013. Despite his initial success, Valthaty's career trajectory took a downturn due to a wrist injury that required surgery, impacting his form.\n\nValthaty began his cricketing journey through the age groups of Mumbai Cricket during the late 1990s. He was part of India's Under-19 squad for the 2002 World Cup, where an eye injury during a match against Bangladesh halted his development. Despite this setback, Valthaty persevered and eventually made his List A debut for Mumbai in 2006.\n\nValthaty's career took a significant turn when he was signed by Rajasthan Royals in 2009. His performances for Mumbai's Twenty20 side led to a contract with Kings XI Punjab in 2011. Valthaty made a mark by hitting the season's first hundred -- an unbeaten 120 against the Super Kings. He went on to score 463 runs in 14 matches in the 2011 IPL season. Valthaty also played four first-class and five List-A matches."

        "date": "Tue Aug 20 15:02:00 2024",
        "body": "Australian cricket icon Steve Smith has addressed questions about his potential retirement, affirming that he remains focused on enjoying the game and hasn’t set a definite date for hanging up his boots.\n\nDespite missing out on Australia‘s squad for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, Smith has been making waves internationally, notably captaining Washington Freedom to victory in the Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC).\n\nSteve Smith dismisses retirement speculation\n\nDuring a recent media interaction, Smith downplayed any immediate thoughts of retirement, emphasizing his passion for the game and expressing his excitement about upcoming opportunities.\n\n“I don’t have any plans; I’m just enjoying playing at the moment. I’m pretty relaxed and I’m looking forward to this summer,” Smith told reporters.\n\nThe 35-year-old added that he expects to participate in several matches in the Big Bash League (BBL) this year, although he remains open to future opportunities as they arise.\n\n“I think I’ll get a few [BBL] games in this year and then we’ll see where we go from there. Every chance I get, I jump at it,” Smith said.\n\nSmith talks about his batting position\n\nSmith also revealed ongoing discussions about his international future with Australia’s coaching staff. While his participation in upcoming T20 matches is uncertain, he confirmed that he will play a role in the one-day internationals in England before making any decisions on his future.\n\n“The conversations I’ve had so far are that we’ll go to England and the boys will have the T20s, and then I’m there for the one-dayers and we’ll make a decision after that,” he said, hinting at potential changes depending on team dynamics and personal preferences.\n\nRegarding his batting position, Smith exhibited his usual team-first attitude. While some of his teammates, including Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, have expressed a preference for him to bat at number four, Smith said he remains flexible.\n\n“Those conversations are happening in the background. I saw some comments that Usman (Khawaja) made and I think he said he likes me down at number four, and I think Marnus (Labuschagne) is of a similar thought pattern,” he remarked, underscoring his willingness to adapt as needed.\n\nAlso READ: Australian star Steve Smith opens up on his future in T20I cricket\n\nExcels as captain in the Major League Cricket\n\nAlthough Smith was not selected for Australia’s T20 World Cup campaign, his recent performances in the MLC have been nothing short of outstanding. Leading Washington Freedom to the title, Smith was the tournament’s second-highest run-scorer, amassing 336 runs in nine matches, including three half-centuries. He averaged an impressive 56.00 with a strike rate of 148.67, reaffirming his status as one of cricket’s premier batsmen.\n\nSmith’s leadership in the MLC and his stellar batting have demonstrated that despite not featuring in Australia’s current T20 plans, he remains a force to be reckoned with on the global stage. As he continues to enjoy his time in the game, cricket fans around the world will be watching closely to see how much longer this modern-day legend will continue to grace the sport."
