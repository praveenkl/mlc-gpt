        "body": "Australian cricket icon Steve Smith has addressed questions about his potential retirement, affirming that he remains focused on enjoying the game and hasn’t set a definite date for hanging up his boots.\n\nDespite missing out on Australia‘s squad for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, Smith has been making waves internationally, notably captaining Washington Freedom to victory in the Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC).\n\nSteve Smith dismisses retirement speculation\n\nDuring a recent media interaction, Smith downplayed any immediate thoughts of retirement, emphasizing his passion for the game and expressing his excitement about upcoming opportunities.\n\n“I don’t have any plans; I’m just enjoying playing at the moment. I’m pretty relaxed and I’m looking forward to this summer,” Smith told reporters.\n\nThe 35-year-old added that he expects to participate in several matches in the Big Bash League (BBL) this year, although he remains open to future opportunities as they arise.\n\n“I think I’ll get a few [BBL] games in this year and then we’ll see where we go from there. Every chance I get, I jump at it,” Smith said.\n\nSmith talks about his batting position\n\nSmith also revealed ongoing discussions about his international future with Australia’s coaching staff. While his participation in upcoming T20 matches is uncertain, he confirmed that he will play a role in the one-day internationals in England before making any decisions on his future.\n\n“The conversations I’ve had so far are that we’ll go to England and the boys will have the T20s, and then I’m there for the one-dayers and we’ll make a decision after that,” he said, hinting at potential changes depending on team dynamics and personal preferences.\n\nRegarding his batting position, Smith exhibited his usual team-first attitude. While some of his teammates, including Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, have expressed a preference for him to bat at number four, Smith said he remains flexible.\n\n“Those conversations are happening in the background. I saw some comments that Usman (Khawaja) made and I think he said he likes me down at number four, and I think Marnus (Labuschagne) is of a similar thought pattern,” he remarked, underscoring his willingness to adapt as needed.\n\nAlso READ: Australian star Steve Smith opens up on his future in T20I cricket\n\nExcels as captain in the Major League Cricket\n\nAlthough Smith was not selected for Australia’s T20 World Cup campaign, his recent performances in the MLC have been nothing short of outstanding. Leading Washington Freedom to the title, Smith was the tournament’s second-highest run-scorer, amassing 336 runs in nine matches, including three half-centuries. He averaged an impressive 56.00 with a strike rate of 148.67, reaffirming his status as one of cricket’s premier batsmen.\n\nSmith’s leadership in the MLC and his stellar batting have demonstrated that despite not featuring in Australia’s current T20 plans, he remains a force to be reckoned with on the global stage. As he continues to enjoy his time in the game, cricket fans around the world will be watching closely to see how much longer this modern-day legend will continue to grace the sport."

        "body": "Australia Test captain Pat Cummins has taken an eight-week break to re-energise himself in his quest to lift the coveted Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India later this year. Cummins, who recently returned from the United States following his maiden stint in Major League Cricket, was rested for next month's white-ball tour of the United Kingdom to manage his workload and give him time to work on his body ahead of a busy summer. \"Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it,\" Cummins was quoted as saying by Fox Sports.\n\n\"I've basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer.\n\n\"It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, makes you less susceptible to injuries,\" he added.\n\nCummins had a busy last 12 months after fracturing his wrist towards the end of the Ashes campaign in England.\n\nHe played in an ODI series against India, the triumphant ODI World Cup campaign, three Tests against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour of New Zealand, two Tests against New Zealand, the Indian Premier League, the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the MLC tournament.\n\n\"I'm very sore today after a week of gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can't really nail it while you're in the midst of the season,\" the 31-year-old said.\n\n\"I'll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can't really fit in the middle of the season.\" This year's Border-Gavaskar Trophy will be a five-Test contest. Since 2017, Australia has failed to lay its hands on the trophy, with India winning four consecutive series including the historic triumphs on Australian soil in 2018-19 and 2020-21.\n\nAnd, Cummins is desperate to lift the trophy this summer under his captaincy.\n\n\"It's the trophy I haven't won before... this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven't ticked off,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"We've achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\n\"That's what lies ahead of us this summer. They're (India) a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Cummins is in no mood to quit T20 cricket as of now, and hopes to help Australia win the gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make its debut at the quadrennial showpiece.\n\n\"Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"I'd love to be on that side (at LA28). I think I'll be 35 or something, so hopefully still there or thereabouts.\n\n\"Honestly right now, it feels a long way away. Maybe once we get closer and start building into it, everyone gets a bit more excited,\" he said.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

        "body": "Australian Test skipper Pat Cummins has decided to take an eight-week break from cricket. The pacer has taken a strategic pause, potentially to boost his performance in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\n\nThe past year has been incredibly demanding for Cummins, with a packed schedule that included the Ashes, ODI World Cup, various Test series, IPL, T20 World Cup, and most recently, the Major League Cricket campaign in the United States. This non-stop cricket schedule has taken its toll, prompting Cricket Australia to manage Cummins’ workload carefully.\n\nCummins’ decision to step away from cricket for eight weeks is part of a calculated plan to prepare for the highly anticipated five-Test series against India starting in late November. The break will allow him to focus on his strength work and conditioning.\n\n“I’m very sore today after a week of gym, Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can’t really nail it while you’re in the midst of the season. I’ll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can’t really fit in the middle of the season,” Cummins told Fox Cricket.\n\nI’ve basically been bowling non-stop since the WTC final: Pat Cummins\n\nThe Sydney-born plans to use this time for intensive gym work, running, and rehabilitation exercises. This training aims to make him less prone to injury and capable of bowling longer spells while maintaining speeds above 140km/h during the upcoming series.\n\n“Everyone that comes back after a break and is a little bit fresher, you never regret it. I’ve basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer. It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintain pace is a bit easier, make you less susceptible to injuries,” he added.\n\nCummins also acknowledged the significance of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which has slipped away from Australia since 2017. The 31-year-old also ranked the mighty Indians as a great side but is confident playing them in the historic Test series.\n\n“It’s the trophy I haven’t won before … this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven’t ticked off. They’re a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we’re really well placed also,” Cummins concluded."
