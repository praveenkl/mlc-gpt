        "text": "**Debut of Pat Cummins and Overseas Stars**: Australian bowler Pat Cummins made his debut in MLC's second season, which concluded on July 28. Cummins, one of the world's top cricketers, is part of a growing list of international stars who have joined MLC, including Kieron Pollard, Heinrich Klaasen, Steve Smith, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, and Kagiso Rabada.\n\n**Talent Acquisition**: MLC has outbid rival leagues, such as The Hundred in England, to attract top talent. The league's ability to offer competitive salaries, with each team having a $1.15 million cap, and its strategic partnership with Indian IPL teams have helped lure overseas players.\n\n**Salary Structure**: Each team has a $830,000 allocation for up to nine overseas players, with top stars potentially earning more than the top salary band of Â£125,000 (around $160,000) in The Hundred.\n\n**Competition with The Hundred**: The success of MLC has forced The Hundred to make changes, with plans to sell 49% stakes in its teams to private investors to increase salaries and attract more international talent.\n\n**Expansion Plans**: MLC aims to add two more teams in 2026 and build more grounds to host matches, while The Hundred plans to expand its fixture list.\n\n**Future of the League**: The competition between MLC and The Hundred is expected to continue, with schedule clashes likely in the future. However, MLC's tournament director, Justin Geale, believes that both leagues can coexist and attract top talent."

        "text": "The MLC has completed its second season, showcasing its potential as a platform for international players and highlighting the need to engage local youth to ensure cricket's long-term viability in the US. The league has seen standout performances, such as Oregon-born Sanjay Krishnamurthi's winning run for the San Francisco Unicorns. However, the league faces challenges in building fan-team camaraderie, partially due to the lack of dedicated stadiums and a home-and-away structure. Despite this, players are beginning to consider long-term affiliations, and investments from tech entrepreneurs and IPL franchises are contributing to the league's growth. The league currently consists of six teams, with four IPL franchises playing key roles in team management. Expansion plans are on the horizon, and teams are investing in grassroots initiatives to develop cricket in the US. The league has provided exciting matches, including a thrilling challenger match between Texas and San Francisco, but still needs to cultivate dedicated team followings."
