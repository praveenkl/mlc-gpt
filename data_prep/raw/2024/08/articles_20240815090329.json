        "body": "Australia Test captain could feature in the upcoming Sheffield Shield (Australia’s domestic red-ball competition) ahead of the India Test series slated to get underway from November this year.\n\nCummins recently took part in the Major League Cricket in USA and has been rested from Australia’s white-ball tour of the UK. During this time, he plans to work on his fitness ahead of the five Tests against India.\n\n“Ronnie (Australia coach Andrew McDonald) called me the other day and said we need to talk about this. I prefer to go a little bit fresher but definitely play some cricket going in,” Cummins was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.\n\n“So I’d say it’s either two or three ODIs, plus a Shield (game) or maybe just some Shield, maybe some NSW one-day stuff. I imagine kind of late October/early November will be when I start playing building up for the Tests,” he added.\n\nAfter the India series at home, Australia will tour Sri Lanka for two Tests as they aim to qualify for the final of the 2025 ICC World Test Championship.\n\nCummins may also play in an ODI series against Pakistan in November as part of his preparation.\n\nIn an interview to ESPNcricinfo, Cummins threw some light on what he plans to do during his time away from international cricket.\n\n“I still get that same amount of break and then just probably start one or two weeks later heading into the summer… I’ll get home, I’ll have a good six or eight weeks off bowling where I’ll get in the gym every day, do some running, and get some strength back into my body. And then we’ve got a big Test match series (vs India) for our home summer, so that’ll be the focus,” he said.\n\nIndia’s tour of Australia starts from November 22 with Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney set to host a Test each."

Taskin, though, hasn’t bowled a delivery in red-ball cricket since June last year, and will only play second Test, starting on August 30.\n\n“We have selected five pacers mindful of the fact that Taskin Ahmed will only play the second Test. He hasn’t bowled in a Test since June last year and we have decided to include him in the A Team for the second four-dayer against Pakistan A to get him into the rhythm for longer version matches,” said Gazi Ashraf Hossain, Chairman National Selection Panel, to reporters.\n\nPakistan and Bangladesh have played six Test series so far with Bangladesh yet to win a Test match against the Shan Masood-led hosts’. They managed to draw only one of the 13 Test matches between these teams.\n\n“The emphasis was on picking our best players for this version. This is a well-balanced squad. The likes of Mushfiqur (Rahim), Mominul (Haque) and Shakib (Al Hasan) have played 216 matches combined and there is no substitute for that kind of experience.”\n\n“Taijul (Islam) and Miraz (Mehidy Hasan) have been leading the spin department for a long time and have over 350 wickets between them. We also expect Shanto (Najmul Hossain), Litton (Kumar Das) and the other batsmen to step up because to be competitive against Pakistan, we will need a team effort,” added Hossain.\n\nBangladesh will arrive in Lahore on August 13 and will train at the Gaddafi Stadium from August 14-16, before traveling to Islamabad on August 17 and hold practice sessions at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium from August 18-20 in the run-up to the first Test.
