        "text": "* Jason Roy, a 32-year-old England cricketer, has given up his England contract to play in the first edition of Major League Cricket (MLC) in the US this summer.\n* The tournament will take place in Texas during the final two weeks of July, and Roy is likely to play for the LA Knight Riders, one of six newly-formed teams.\n* Roy will not miss any England matches to play in the tournament, and his decision will not affect his future selection prospects for England.\n* The MLC tournament is a franchise-based competition, with four teams at least partially backed by IPL owners.\n* Roy's decision to play in MLC means he will forgo the remainder of his incremental England contract, which is worth between £60,000 and £70,000 a year, but could earn more than twice that amount for just two weeks' work in the US."

        "text": "The Seattle Orcas had a disappointing season in MLC 2, finishing at the bottom of the table with only two points. They lost their final match to the Texas Super Kings by 37 runs, capping off a poor season. The team's international players, who are mostly from South Africa, were exhausted after playing in the World Cup semifinals and had little rest before joining the MLC. The Orcas struggled to put up consistent runs, especially when batting first, and have now lost seven in a row when opening with the bat. One bright spot in their final match was Ayan Desai, who made his MLC debut and took two wickets and 30 runs with an economy of 7.50. However, the team's batting performance was poor, with no player scoring more than 26 runs."
