        "date": "Tue Aug 20 08:26:05 2024",
        "body": "David Warner and Steve Smith have signed big deals with two Sydney franchises for the Big Bash League (BBL) 2024-25.\n\nSmith has signed a three-year deal with the Sydney Sixers following his title-winning performance for the Washington Freedom in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. Warner has agreed to a two-year contract with the Sydney Thunder.\n\nSmith played for the Sixers last season during the break from international cricket. He was part of the squad that reached the final.\n\nHe is likely to be unavailable for the first half of the new season, as Australia will take on India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy from November 22 to January 7. The BBL 2024-25 will start on December 15 and continue until January 27.\n\n“It is good to have Steve Smith for the next three seasons. He is one of the best players in the world, and our fans are already excited to see him on the field,” Sixers General Manager Rachael Haynes said (via Sydney Sixers’ official website).\n\nWarner has retired from international cricket and will be available for the whole season. Due to international matches, he didn’t play in the league for nine consecutive years. He played eight games over the last two seasons.\n\n“I have been a part of Thunder, and I love playing for the franchise. I hope the new season is going to be better than the last year,” he said."
