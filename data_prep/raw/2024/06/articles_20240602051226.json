        "body": "Is cricket really coming to the United States?\n\nThe game has long desired to conquer the land of dreams, and it won’t get a better shot at finally making it big.\n\nAs the United States hosts 16 matches of the latest ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, there are high hopes that cricket can finally make significant inroads in a lucrative and populous market.\n\nThe stars have seemingly aligned: Following the T20 World Cup, the second edition of the privately run Major League Cricket franchise tournament will bring some of the game’s biggest stars to the US and, in 2028, cricket will feature at the LA Olympics for the first time since 1900.\n\nHowever, cricket in the US has a history of poor governance, riven by factions and financial mismanagement. The sport’s growth has been hampered by the country’s sheer size and diversity of cricket cultures – factors also considered potential strengths.\n\nHere’s the lowdown on cricket’s history in the US and a peek into its future:\n\nIs there an existing cricket culture in the USA?\n\nWhen USA and Canada meet in the opening match on June 1, there will be plentiful reminders that these two countries played the first international cricket match in 1844, when Canada won the two-day fixture.\n\nBut the game took a backseat until the latter half of the 20th century when increased immigration – particularly from the Indian subcontinent – saw the game grow – with little cohesion – in communities from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh as well as the Caribbean.\n\nDoes USA have a cricket board?\n\nA national governing board, the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA), was formed in 1965 but it struggled to unify the diverse and siloed cricket communities for the next three decades.\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC), at times, implemented sanctions – withdrawing USA from tournaments, withholding funds and suspensions – all of which failed to overcome the fundamental issues.\n\nIn 2017, the USACA was expelled from the ICC.\n\nSo who’s in charge now?\n\nA new governing body, USA Cricket (USAC), was formed in 2019 and the USA was officially back in the ICC’s fold as an associate member. There was a new board and a new constitution, but the underlying problems of geography, culture and power struggles remained.\n\nThe following year, after extensive research on potential expansion markets, the ICC identified the USA as the game’s most desirable target. This was largely down to its size, economy, broadcast market and the existing cricket infrastructure and culture.\n\nWho is running the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup?\n\nThe decision to host T20 World Cup fixtures in the US was merely the first step in a long-term strategy.\n\nThe inclusion of the US in the West Indies’ successful bid to host this year’s tournament presented a golden opportunity to expand the sport’s profile but USA Cricket was in no position to facilitate a major event.\n\nIn October 2022, the ICC installed its own local organising committee – T20 USA Inc – to oversee the event.\n\nWhat’s wrong with USA Cricket?\n\nIn the five years since its inception, USA Cricket has had minimal and – at times – no full-time staff. It has instead relied on a mix of temporary contractors, consultants and volunteers.\n\nIt has been issued multiple sanctions by the ICC and – in 2022 – its funding was temporarily suspended.\n\nIt is currently operating without a CEO.\n\nThe selection process for the T20 World Cup squad was mired in controversy and excluded numerous eligible players.\n\nThe head coach, former Australian international Stuart Law, wasn’t appointed until mid-April.\n\nHow good is USA’s T20 World Cup squad?\n\nOn the field, the team has had an encouraging build-up, trouncing Canada 4-0 and defeating Bangladesh 2-1 in bilateral T20 series.\n\nThose results are astonishing considering USA had not played a T20 International since the World Cup qualifiers in July 2022. Since USA Cricket was admitted, the national men’s side has played just seven T20Is outside qualifying events. Since the start of 2022, they have played a total of twelve T20Is. By comparison, Nepal has played 36 in the same period.\n\nHave things improved since the US was announced as the co-host?\n\nThe publicly available minutes of USAC board meetings show that off-field conflicts continue to boil over.\n\nIn the lead-up to the biggest cricket tournament ever held on US soil, there have been squabbles over the constitution, allegations of racial discrimination and disagreements on the process of choosing a new CEO.\n\nA lawsuit filed by two directors against five fellow directors and a former CEO was dropped in 2022, but in 2023 another lawsuit was filed against USAC by former USA captain and league director Sushil Nadkarni.\n\nAt the most recent board meeting on March 27, Chair Venu Pisike “reaffirmed that board members MUST conduct themselves professionally and stop interrupting the board proceedings and being disrespectful to fellow board members”.\n\nHow might cricket grow after the T20 World Cup?\n\nAmid concerns about USAC’s governance, the ICC is forging ahead with plans to create a lasting legacy from the T20 World Cup. Profits from the matches held in Nassau County (New York), Broward County (Florida) and Grand Prairie (Texas) will be funnelled into cricket’s growth in the US.\n\nICC’s game development programme, Playground to Podium, aims to reach one million children – half of them female – by the 2028 LA Olympics, and regional development manager for the Americas, Fara Gorsi, is confident of success.\n\n“By the time we reach the LA Games it will be flourishing in all three cities as a minimum,” Gorsi told Al Jazeera. “And [it] will create a framework that will then be deployed across the states.\n\n“If we want to see a different community grow cricket in the USA it has to come organically through schools, through new leaders, new communities, parents, teachers.”\n\nGorsi says the complexity of the US sporting system requires a targeted and flexible approach in each district as the ICC rolls out resources, initially in the three host cities, to develop facilitators and coaches via an entry-level training programme called Criiio. There are long-term plans to permeate the college system, a key for any sport in the US.\n\nIs there a way to improve the situation?\n\nThe ICC has expressed concerns to USAC and has given them a July deadline to appoint a CEO. They can apply sanctions of varying severity but pressure will also be applied by the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC).\n\nTo become certified as cricket’s national governing body, USAC will have to meet USOPC’s rigorous criteria and standards.\n\nAs for the legacy programme, the ICC has not yet discussed a timeframe or mechanism for any possible future handover of the development programme and its funding to USA Cricket. Gorsi hopes it will eventually happen but admits there are significant barriers to overcome.\n\n“Without wanting to sound disrespectful, they’ve held it on to like it’s their sport,” said Gorsi.\n\n“If we grow it organically we’ll grow faster. We need to take the shackles off and allow it to be fun and have that accessibility across the country.\n\n“Once we break some of those barriers down and allow the US audience to be part of this wonderful game that we all love, I think it will spread like wildfire.”"

        "date": "Sat Jun  1 19:55:00 2024",
        "body": "In the United States of America, a country where people think of cricket as a version of baseball, it is important to understand if the ICC T20 World Cup would be successful or not.\n\nHowever, over the past decade, domestic T20 leagues have taken the cricketing world by storm, transforming the sport from a backyard hobby to a global phenomenon.\n\nAs such in the US, the shortened and quick version of cricket has been gaining popularity little by little.\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC), the US equivalent of the Indian Premier League (IPL), will launch after the World Cup.\n\nUSA Cricket, the ICC's representative organisation for the US, had chosen MLC as its exclusive partner in 2019 to create a professional T20 Cricket League.\n\nIn an effort to propel the USA men's and women's teams to the pinnacle of international competition, the MLC currently also offers assistance to both groups.\n\nThe MLC has been instrumental in providing the much-needed impetus to take cricketing in this region of the world to new heights. The top tier of domestic T20 cricket in the USA was introduced in 2019 with the MLC.\n\nThis has given American cricket players, who are primarily immigrants, a professional platform and high-calibre competition to draw spectators. In 2023, the MLC burst onto the scene, reshaping the American cricket landscape. For the first time, the United States witnessed world-class domestic T20 cricket, captivating audiences with electrifying matches.\n\nBut how would the success of MLC be attributed to?\n\nFirstly, the league would unite some of the top cricket players in the world, giving them a platform where they would display their abilities and dazzle spectators with amazing shows. In addition to drawing in an entirely novel generation of cricket fans, this celebrity influence would improve the game's general standard.\n\nSecondly, it is impossible to overstate the commercial attractiveness of the MLC. The league would serve as a fertile field for rich sponsorship agreements, television rights, and product sales. The MLC attracted numerous sponsors and franchises from other T20 leagues around the world in its inaugural season which was held in 2023. After making an impact in the inaugural season in July 2023, the MLC has got tech giant Cognizant as their title sponsor for the 2024 edition.\n\nIn 2023, each team's total salary cap was $1.15M for the tournament, putting MLC amongst the elite T20 global leagues in terms of player compensation per match.\n\nBesides, Minor League Cricket is the only nationwide tournament involving the strongest male players playing against each other at the best available facilities, with almost all of the players selected in the 2023 MLC Domestic Player Draft. It is important to mention that the Minor Cricket League was introduced in the United States in 2021 to develop the 'gentleman's game' into more of a popular sport in the country.\n\nThis year, immediately following the World Cup, all six of the teams that participated in the MLC's historic debut season will return. Superstars from Afghanistan, Pakistan's Haris Rauf (San Francisco Unicorns), South Africa's Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings), Marco Jansen (Washington Freedom), and Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas), as well as Sunil Narine (LA Knight Riders) of the West Indies, have already been confirmed to compete.\n\nBangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan has been signed as well by the LA Knight Riders for the second season of the tournament. The MLC's games will be held in Grand Prairie Stadium, which is close to Dallas, Texas. The 7,200 seats in this recently refurbished cricket-specific stadium exceed the highest international accreditation standards for a grass wicket.\n\nFor Americans who love cricket, MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan has promised the 'best summer of cricket'.\n\nBeing a trailblazer in USA cricket broadcasting, Srinivasan has long questioned why not a single game played on USA soil was shown on his platform. That compelled him to establish the concept of MLC. After everything fell into place, Srinivasan made the decision. In order to develop a rich talent pool of players to support Minor and Major League Cricket in the US, the MLC is developing international-calibre stadiums, establishing elite junior academies, offering top-notch training facilities and creating high-performance paths.\n\nWith its six clubs and backing from well-known figures in the USA and Indian corporate worlds, the MLC was considered by observers to have all the makings of a successful league last year. ABC, NBC, CBS, and The New York Times are among the major American news networks that have taken an interest in the MLC. According to the league's statistics, it has 40 million views, 3 million likes, and 3 million comments on social media already.\n\nIn conclusion, MLC has transformed cricket in the USA by bringing unprecedented excitement, global appeal, and opportunities for young players. The Major League Cricket and the Minor League Cricket redefined the way the game is played and watched, captivating audiences with their explosive matches and star-studded lineups. As the popularity of MLC continues to soar, the power and significance in shaping the sport's evolution in the USA cannot be underestimated."

Marsh has just joined the Australian team on their three game tour of India and has been the star with the bat.\n\nOpening for Australia, Marsh has scored 81 and 66 not out in his two matches against India. And the Orcas will be thrilled to have snared the in-form allrounder.\n\nWestern Australian Cameron Gannon has also joined Marsh at the Orcas. The dual Australia/American citizen represented the US in four T20s back in 2019.\n\nA number of other internationals have signed-up for the inaugural season. New Zealanders Corey Anderson and Liam Plunkett have also both joined Finch and Stoinis at the Unicorns.\n\nSouth African Anrich Nortje signed for the Washington Freedom, while compatriot Quinton de Kock signed for the Orcas.

The six-team league has been bankrolled by a number of heavyweights in India, with a reported AU$174 million invested by Microsoft boss Satya Nardella and Bollywood legend Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nLast week, Cricket NSW unveiled a partnership with MLC that will see American players come over to play in NSW Premier Cricket, and Aussies go the other way to play in the MLC.\n\nThe partnership will see Cricket NSW provide players and coaches to the Washington team, which could reportedly eventually include Steve Smith. The talismanic Aussie batter won't play in the American T20 League this year due to the Ashes, but is reportedly weighing up a move to the States once he finishes his Test career.\n\nSmith has a second home in New York and a connection to the Big Apple. He popped the question to wife Dani during a holiday there in 2017."

        "body": "The ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 in the United States of America is a big leap for the sport in a country where cricket doesn't have that level of popularity. USA is the co-host for one of the biggest sporting events in the world along with the Caribbean and it will also be a test of the International Cricket Council (ICC) trying to take the game deeper into the markets where cricket is not the first sport. The first big step from the ICC was to sanction a T20 League (Major League Cricket) and then make USA the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup and then build a modular stadium in New York to get the American public closer to the action.\n\nWith T20 World Cup, the second season of the MLC and a new Legends League (Legends Intercontinental T20 League) scheduled to be held in the USA, there is a systematic plan to slowly get the American public introduced to the sport. How long it will take for them to get used to... is everybody's guess but many cricketers, former and current, believe that it is a step in the right direction keeping the sport's qualification into the Olympics in mind, which will be played in Los Angeles.\n\nVirat Kohli, one of the biggest crowd pullers in the game currently, suggested that the T20 World Cup might be the star of the domino effect of what's to come in the future for the sport in the country. Kohli, who visited US Consulate in Mumbai before leaving for the tournament, said that he never thought cricket will get to USA in any format, but here we are.\n\n“Honestly, I never thought we would be playing cricket in any form in the States. But now it’s a reality. And that tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world and the United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first ones on a global scale to accept it, in a way, with the World Cup,\" Kohli said in a video shared by US Consulate.\n\n“I think it’s a great start. It’s the ideal way to begin and it’s going to have a huge impact, and in starting off a kind of a domino effect. I hope it carries on for a long period of time,” he added.\n\n“We have enough people from our regions to keep the game up and alive in the States and make the others more aware about what it feels like to play and watch cricket. And I think it’s got great potential, with the MLC as well. There is already franchise cricket happening there. So I think, it’s moving in the right direction,” Kohli further said."

        "body": "The T20 World Cup 2024 will commence in Dallas with a match between long-time rivals, the USA and Canada. In April, the USA decisively defeated Canada 4-0 in Houston. The home team might have an advantage due to crowd support, with players like Corey Anderson and Ali Khan having experience in larger venues. Additionally, the rest of the American squad is expected to benefit from playing a season of Major League Cricket in front of packed audiences in Dallas.\n\nCanada, on the other hand, has had more time on the Dallas pitch leading up to the World Cup. They secured a convincing victory in their first warm-up game against Nepal before a hurricane interrupted, canceling their final warm-up match and both of the USA’s scheduled warm-up games.\n\nT20I Stats and Records at Grand Prairie Stadium\n\nSo far no international T20I match has taken place at this venue. In the T20 World Cup, this ground is set to host as many as four fixtures.\n\nUSA vs CAN: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report:\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium has not hosted any international matches yet, but it served as one of the two locations for Major League Cricket (MLC) in 2023. Out of the 12 MLC games played here, teams surpassed 175 runs on seven occasions and exceeded 200 runs twice, indicating a favorable batting surface. The average score for the first innings is 167, compared to 144 for the second innings.

        "body": "United States of America (USA) Cricket has made a huge mistake before the start of the much-awaited T20 World Cup 2024, which is set to be played from June 1 to June 29. The United States of America didn't mention the match between the USA and Canada as the inaugural game of the upcoming T20 World Cup.\n\nCricket's popularity has been gradually increasing in the United States of America over the past few years. Major League Cricket (MLC), a professional T20 league, commenced last year in the country. The franchise cricket league attracted cricketers from international teams, starting a new era for cricket in the country.\n\nLauderhill, Florida, New York, and Dallas will host the World Cup matches in the United States. Dallas and Lauderhill will each host four matches in the ICC event. The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York will host eight matches, including the much-anticipated India-Pakistan match on June 9.\n\nOn June 3rd, this venue will host the inaugural game of the 2024 T20 World Cup between Sri Lanka and South Africa - USA Cricket\n\nThe USA Cricket Board mistakenly announced Sri Lanka-South Africa as the inaugural match of the 2024 T20 World Cup instead of the USA-Canada match. The board stated that co-hosting the World Cup signifies a new hope for cricket in the United States.\n\n\"The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium was unveiled May 15th, marking it as a historical moment in USA Cricket history. On June 3rd, this venue will host the inaugural game of the 2024 T20 World Cup between Sri Lanka and South Africa. USA co-hosting this prestigious ICC event heralds a new hope for cricket in the states,\" the statement read.\n\nThe T20 World Cup will begin with the host nations playing their opening matches in early June. The USA will take on Canada in the tournament opener at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Dallas on Saturday, June 1. The West Indies will face Papua New Guinea at the Guyana National Stadium on June 2.\n\nThe top two teams from the four groups will advance to the Super Eight stages of the tournament. The United States of America will not host any matches in the Super Eight and knockout matches, including the semi-finals and the final. The Kensington Oval in Barbados will host the summit clash on Saturday, June 29.\n\nThe Sport's Popularity Decline Due To The World Wars - USA\n\nThe statement highlighted the historical relationship between cricket and the USA. The USA board noted cricket's presence in the US since the 18th century but acknowledged its decline due to factors like world wars and societal changes.\n\n\"Cricket and the USA have had a long-standing friendship without either party fully committing to a formal union. The ardor and fervor in this connection mirrored the climate in many regions of the country, which was frigid during the winter and scorching during the summer. The history of cricket in the United States can be traced back to the 18th century. However, the sport’s popularity declined due to the world wars and other civil upheavals,\" the statement further added."

Ahmed is also the owner of America's largest cricket complex (Prairie View Cricket Complex) located on the outskirts of Houston, housing five turf-wicket grounds on its premises.\n\nThe closure of these investment rounds is a major shot in the arm for this cricket 'start-up'. As part of their deal with USA Cricket, MLC is under obligation to deliver six world-class cricket stadiums. Notably, MLC is under exclusive negotiating agreements with respective city governments in the greater Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco Bay area to construct multi-million-dollar cricket stadiums.\n\nThe procurement of funds in rounds A and A1 will add to the enterprise's financial muscle to materialise the deals presently under negotiations. MLC has already entered into a long-term lease for Airhogs Stadium near Dallas and is expected to start revamping the stadium for cricketing use this summer.\n\n\"The significant funding committed by an outstanding group of investors will allow Major League Cricket to build first-class facilities and accelerate the sport's development across the country, bringing world-class professional cricket to the world's largest sports market,\" said Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders, Major League Cricket in a statement.\n\n\"This investor group comprises leading business executives and successful tech entrepreneurs who have led some of the world's most prominent companies.
