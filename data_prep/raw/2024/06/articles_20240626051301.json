Among the domestic players selected was Aaron Jones, the vice-captain of Team USA.\n\nAaron Jones (PTI Photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: The Domestic Supplementary Draft for Major League Cricket ( MLC ) took place on June 18, finalizing the rosters for the upcoming second season, set to commence on July 5. Among the domestic players selected was Aaron Jones , the vice-captain of Team USA.\n\nWith the immense popularity of the T20 World Cup and the success of the American team, three MLC teams--Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, and Seattle Orcas--had an available roster spot, allowing undrafted domestic players the chance to secure a place in the forthcoming tournament.\n\nThe supplementary draft order was randomly determined on June 18, and the teams were allotted a 48-hour window to strategize and conclude any internal discussions before proceeding with their picks.\n\nThe domestic supplementary draft selections were as follows:\n\nLA Knight Riders - Chaitanya Bishnoi\n\nA top-order batsman and spin bowler, the 29-year-old played for the Chennai Super Kings championship side in 2018 before moving to the United States to pursue his cricket in early 2023. He was a part of the San Francisco Unicorns squad in the 2023 inaugural season of Major League Cricket, featuring in all five matches for the Bay Area side.\n\nHe was also a key member of the Dallas Xforia Giants during the 2023 edition of Minor League Cricket.\n\nSeattle Orcas - Aaron Jones\n\nJones finds himself back in a recognizable locker room, as he was part of the Orcas squad during the first season of Major League Cricket last year. The opening batsman has been instrumental in Team USA's impressive run in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Throughout Team USA's unprecedented World Cup journey, Jones has been making waves and was a key player in the USA's remarkable victory against Pakistan in Texas. The Orcas faithful will be eagerly anticipating more of the same from Jones during the MLC season.\n\nMI New York - Sunny Patel\n\nSunny Patel, a versatile cricketer who bats right-handed in the middle order and bowls leg spin, made a significant impact during the 2023 Minor League Cricket season. His all-round skills were instrumental in propelling the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers to the Championship match, although they ultimately suffered a defeat against the Dallas Mustangs. As MI New York prepares for the 2024 season, Patel brings a unique dimension to their domestic player contingent. He stands out as the sole domestic leg-spinner on their roster, offering a valuable asset to the team's bowling arsenal.\n\n\"Major League Cricket plays a critical role in developing domestic players and providing a pathway to play cricket at the highest level amongst some of the best players in the world. We are thrilled to welcome Chaitanya, Aaron, and Sunny to the 2024 MLC season, adding three more talented domestic players to our league,\" said Major League Cricket Tournament Director, Justin Geale as per a MLC release.\n\nThe highly anticipated second season of MLC is set to kick off on July 5, featuring a thrilling opening match between the defending champions MI New York and the Seattle Orcas at Morrisville, NC. Following this clash, the Texas Super Kings will face off against the LA Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium, TX.\n\nGiven the overwhelming success and packed stadiums of the inaugural season, cricket enthusiasts are advised to secure their tickets well in advance to avoid disappointment. Fans can choose from various ticket options, with general admission tickets starting at an affordable price of $30 per person, ensuring accessibility for all.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"
