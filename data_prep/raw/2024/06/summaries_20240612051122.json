        "text": "* The MLC tournament has the potential to succeed in the US, driven by the Indian diaspora who have a high median household income and purchasing power.\n* The Indian diaspora is expected to market the matches, provide facilities, and support the game, just like they did in Toronto, where they took over the local city league and professionalized it.\n* The league can attract local talent, like Saurabh Netravalkar, who works at Oracle and plays cricket for the USA.\n* The tournament can start modestly and build up a fan base, with marquee players like Chris Gayle and Andre Russell, who can boost attendance and viewership.\n* The cooperation of the BCCI is crucial for the success of the league, and sending second-tier players and retired players to play in the US can be a great hit with the crowds.\n* The BCCI should use the MLC franchise to give talented but unproven young players the chance to hone their skills in foreign conditions, which can benefit Indian bowlers and batsmen.\n* The league can provide a semi-amateurish wage potential for players, similar to Major League Soccer (MLS), and can create a sporting event that is integrated into the IPL.\n* The advertising opportunities for Indian firms cannot be overlooked, as this would be a cheap venue to attract eyeballs in the United States."
