Other cricket investors include Iconic Ventures, Madrona Venture Group and executives from Google.\n\n\"What gets me excited is seeing if cricket can become a mainstream sport in the U.S.,\" said Soma Somasegar, venture capitalist and managing director at Madrona.\n\nSomasegar and Nadella are among the key owners of Seattle's cricket team, named the Orcas. They're also investors in the overall league.\n\nMoney Report\n\n\"Satya [Nadella] and I have been talking about bringing cricket to America for many years,\" Somasegar told CNBC.\n\nNadella is such a die-hard cricket fan that Microsoft has a cricket field at its campus in Bellevue, Washington.\n\n\"A lot of us immigrants grew up with this sport. We'd study and watch cricket — on repeat,\" said Somasegar.\n\nIn total, nearly $850 million is currently in the process of being invested in building a viable cricket league in the U.S., people familiar with the funding said. The people asked not to be named because the funding information is private.\n\nCurrently, there are six professional teams in Major League Cricket, with each team expected to spend between roughly $75 million and $100 million over the coming years. That includes the cost of putting together a team, hiring the right talent and building stadiums where live cricket matches can be played.\n\nAdding to the fanfare is the T20 World Cup, which is being held at three locations in the U.S. and several in the West Indies throughout June.\n\nOn Thursday, in a stunning blow, the U.S. team beat Pakistan in a match held near Dallas. Fans are now counting down to the highly anticipated India vs. Pakistan match Sunday at the newly developed Nassau County stadium in New York.\n\nThe last time India and Pakistan matched up, more than 300 million people in India tuned in to watch the game, according to The New York Times.\n\nTicket reseller StubHub said the average price of tickets for Sunday's rivalry match is $1,300. The average price for the other 54 matches of the tournament is $120, the company said.\n\nVenture capitalist Anurag Jain, part owner of Major League Cricket team the San Francisco Unicorns, said the U.S. national team is primarily made up of players in the league.\n\n\"The goal is to make cricket a mainstream sport,\" said Satyan Gajwani, the vice chairman of Times Internet, the digital arm of the Times of India. He heads up Willow TV, which has the exclusive streaming rights for cricket in North America, including the T20 World Cup.\n\nGajwani is also one of the investors in the U.S. league. He said his group is going after the incredibly loyal fans from South Asia who live in the U.S.\n\n\"You essentially have five million really hard-core fans that love cricket,\" Gajwani told CNBC, referring to the South Asian diaspora in the U.S.\n\nHe added that expats from the U.K. and Australia who live in the U.S. are also big consumers of cricket.\n\nSouth Asians on average have the highest gross income of any ethnic group in the U.S., according to research from Indiaspora, a nonprofit community of Indian leaders around the world.\n\n\"That leaves a lot of discretionary income that is available to be spent on sports and entertainment,\" said M.R. Rangaswami, founder and chairman of Indiaspora.\n\nRangaswami, who said he will be at the match Sunday, acknowledged that the U.S. sports scene is tough to crack, with Americans consumed by basketball and football. He said a potential entry point could be through fans of baseball, which has some resemblance to cricket."

        "body": "If you’ve been around these parts for a while, you’re aware that we’ve become cricket-pilled over the past year. So it goes when Grand Prairie has become the epicenter of the world’s second-most popular sport and its attempt to conquer America.\n\nBut as impressive as Major League Cricket was in its debut season last summer, that only set the table for what kicked off—er, bowled off?—last weekend: the T-20 World Cup, otherwise known as the biggest cricket competition on Earth. North Texas is one of three American sites hosting matches, and as Kunwar Khuldune Shahid wrote last week, it could bolster the sport’s presence domestically better than any franchised league could hope to.\n\nThat hope burns brighter than ever after a moment like yesterday, when the United States upset Pakistan in Grand Prairie Stadium. For the uninitiated, Pakistan is cricket royalty, routinely vying with subcontinental rival India for dominance of the sport. The Americans? Uh, way less so. This is the United States’ first appearance in the competition. And yet, when both teams had completed their allotment of overs, the score was level. Enter the “super over”—cricket overtime—where the United States pulled away in no small part due to the heroics of Saurabh Netravalkar, an Oracle engineer by day. The Americans have now won both of their opening matches, which means all they need is one win over India (extremely unlikely) or Ireland (much more doable) to advance to the quarter-finals.\n\nBig things could be happening for American cricket, in other words. But even if the United States doesn’t advance, they’ve already won by creating a cricket moment that will be remembered for a long, long time. Think of yesterday’s five-run victory as something like the Miracle on Ice of cricket. And every time the highlights get played, Grand Prairie will forever be the setting. Pretty cool!"

        "date": "Wed Feb 22 00:36:49 2023",
        "body": "Steve Smith is reportedly considering a move to America to take part in a new T20 cricket league. Major League Cricket will hold its inaugural season this July, taking part in Texas and North Carolina over a three-week period.\n\nThe six-team league has been bankrolled by a number of heavyweights in India, with a reported AU$174 million invested by Microsoft boss Satya Nardella and Bollywood legend Shah Rukh Khan. Last week, Cricket NSW unveiled a partnership with Major League Cricket that will see American players come over to play in NSW Premier Cricket, and Aussies go the other way to play in the MLC.\n\n'UNUSUAL FOR HIM': Steve Smith's dressing room blow-up revealed\n\n'WHAT A JOKE': Cricket world rages at 'pathetic' Aussie women's farce\n\nCricket NSW has also entered into a partnership with the Washington DC franchise - one of six teams with a $1.5 million salary cap each season. The other teams are based in New York, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, with a number of IPL franchises engaging in similar partnerships with the US teams.\n\n“With the global cricket landscape currently undergoing significant transition, we view the United States as a market with immense growth potential,” Cricket NSW chief executive Lee Germon said last week. “Cricket NSW’s track record in high performance cricket and elite match operations is second to none and we believe we can bring a raft of experience to MLC and the Washington DC franchise in the coming years.”\n\nThe partnership will see Cricket NSW provide players and coaches to the Washington team, which could eventually include Smith. The talismanic Aussie batter won't play in the American T20 League this year due to the Ashes, but is reportedly weighing up a move to the States once he finishes his Test career.\n\nAccording to News Corp, Smith has been in talks with Major League Cricket bosses about making a cameo in 2024. The T20 World Cup will take place in the US and West Indies next year before the Major League Cricket season, opening a window for Smith to stay in the States and play.\n\n“We’ve been in touch with Steve about his plans and what he’s thinking,” MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta told News Corp. “What he’d love to do at some point is play cricket in the US as his schedule permits.\n\n“His view was that if he could make it work and if we could make it work – I know this season, he has commitments. I don’t know what the Australian calendar is next year but I believe there is enough space for him to potentially play.” Long-term … our view is that we might see a lot of him in the US.”\n\nSmith has a second home in New York and a connection to the Big Apple. He popped the question to wife Dani during a holiday there in 2017.\n\n\"The opportunities for all our players is going to be brilliant,\" Germon said. \"Steve has made no secret he loves New York. But there are also two or three other players I have spoken to who would love to play cricket in the United States.\n\n\"We will look to use the players within the Cricket NSW ecosystem to not only highlight the T20 competition and MLC, but cricket in the United States as well. Put it this way - I don't think we'll be short of players putting their hands up.\"\n\nSteve Smith set to finish cricket career in America?\n\nSpeaking last year, Smith flagged the possibility that he might finish his career in America. “There’s obviously leagues popping up everywhere around the world now, and I think you’ll probably see more players in the back end of their career going down that route, so it’s potentially something I’ll look at in the future,” Smith told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n“The US has been a market that cricket’s been trying to get into for some time. So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nAnd it might come sooner rather than later, with Smith revealing in January that he wasn't sure how much longer he wants to play Test cricket. \"We'll see. I'm enjoying it at the moment,\" he told reporters during the SCG Test. \"I really can't say how long I'll play for. I'm not sure.\n\n\"I'll take it one tour at a time, just enjoy it, enjoy training and trying to get better as well. Whilst I'm doing that, I'm happy playing but I don't know how long that'll last.\"\n\nHe later hosed down speculation he is on the verge of walking away from international cricket, but he's clearly thinking about what his future looks like."

        "body": "The Knight Riders Group (KRG), backed by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside actor Juhi Chawla and businessman Jay Mehta, is investing in a 10,000-capacity cricket stadium near Los Angeles.\n\nLocated at a 15-acre land parcel in Great Park, Irvine, Southern California, some 40 miles from downtown Los Angeles, the plan is driven by Major League Cricket (MLC). The org has revealed that an exclusive negotiating agreement with the city of Irvine to move forward with lease negotiations and design approvals has been approved. The investment in the stadium is likely to be in the range of $30 million, Variety understands.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nBollywood Superstar Shah Rukh Khan Teams With Hitmaker Rajkumar Hirani for 'Dunki'\n\nShane Warne, Australian Cricket Legend, Dies at 52\n\nBBC Studios Sets Content Deal With India's MX Player - Global Bulletin\n\nKRG are owners of the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the lucrative Indian Premier League cricket tournament and Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nThe stadium, which will have the capacity to be expanded, will be designed by architects HKS and will be home to MLC’s Southern California-based franchise, in the heart of one of the largest cricket-loving populations in the U.S., including an estimated 100,000 cricket fans with a further 200,000 more located in Los Angeles County. Two Minor League Cricket teams, the SoCal Lashings and Hollywood Master Blasters, along with local adult and youth leagues in the area provide a base of grassroots support for cricket in the region.\n\nThe stadium plans include state-of-the-art training facilities, locker rooms, luxury suites, dedicated parking, concessions, field lighting and an international-grade pitch to meet International Cricket Council (ICC) accreditation. There are two major events that the proposed stadium, if completed in time, could host – the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024, which will be co-hosted by the U.S. and the West Indies, and if cricket is included in the 2028 Olympic Games to be held in Los Angeles, which the ICC is bidding for. U.S.A Cricket is also expected to bid for future men’s and women’s World Cup tournaments.\n\n“Our investment in MLC in America is based on our belief in the exciting future of cricket in the U.S.A and is well aligned to our strategy of establishing Knight Riders as a global brand in T20 cricket,” said Khan, per an MLC press release. “Plans to build a world class cricket stadium in the greater Los Angeles area is exciting for us and MLC. This will no doubt have a transformational impact for cricket in one of the world’s most iconic metropolitan destinations.”\n\nSameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders, MLC, added: “Great Park’s position as a hub for community recreation and its array of first-class sports facilities makes it an ideal location for the addition of a venue serving the local cricket-loving community and the broader Greater Los Angeles region with major international cricket events set to take place there.”\n\nBest of Variety\n\nMolly Shannon's Memoir 'Hello Molly' Is Already an Instant Bestseller on Amazon\n\n2022 Primetime Emmys Awards Season Calendar: The Governors Balls are Back After Two Years\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney Plus in April 2022\n\nSign up for Variety’s Newsletter.

        "body": "Alex Carey is the latest big-name Australia signing for the USA's Major League Cricket, with the men's Test team keeper-batter to turn out for Los Angeles Knight Riders when the T20 tournament begins next month.\n\nCarey becomes the 20th Australia player to join the second season of the US League which immediately follows the current ICC T20 World Cup being staged in the USA and Caribbean.\n\nCricket in America received a significant boost overnight when USA scored an historic super-over victory against 2022 Cup finalists Pakistan at Dallas, only the team's second success against a Test nation following their previous T20 win against Ireland in 2021.\n\nCarey will join fellow national representatives Adam Zampa and SA teammate Spencer Johnson at the affiliate franchise of this year's Indian Premier League champions Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nThe LA team will play their seven minor round MLC matches at grounds in Dallas, Texas and Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nBefore signing the deal, the 32-year-old was one of the few members of Australia's current Test outfit not to be playing competitive cricket during the southern winter.\n\nOnly opening batter Usman Khawaja is taking a full off-season sabbatical, although the reigning ICC men's Test Cricketer of the Year is also in the US as Prime Video's ambassador for their coverage of the T20 World Cup.\n\nCarey's Test counterparts Mitchell Marsh, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head and Cameron Green are all members of Australia's Cup contingent, while Marnus Labuschagne and Nathan Lyon are playing county cricket in the UK.\n\nSteve Smith is the only other member of the XI that took the field for Australia's most recent Test against New Zealand last March not currently playing, but he will be part of MLC starting on July 5 with Washington Freedom.\n\nSuch is the burgeoning appeal of the three-week MLC competition, it was announced earlier this week that Australia Test captain Pat Cummins had signed a four-year deal with Cricket Victoria-aligned San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nCarey, who will join the LA outfit ahead of the pre-season training camp in Florida starting June 28, had previously indicated a preference for returning to the UK's domestic T20 Vitality Blast tournament that kicked off last month.\n\nHowever, the timing of MLC coupled with its shorter playing window – which ensures minimal family disruption for Carey's wife Eloise and their children Louis and Clementine – made the US option a better fit.\n\n\"I've never been to America so it will be great to try the T20 league there,\" Carey told cricket.com.au today.\n\n\"I'm grateful and lucky it fell into place.\n\n\"I had interest late last year about heading over to a couple of teams in England.\n\n\"But it wasn't quite the right time for me to make a decision on what to do, so I left it a bit longer and those teams filled up.\"\n\nDespite the abuse and harassment directed at Carey and his family following his stumping of England's Jonny Bairstow in last year's second Ashes Test at Lord's – as documented in Prime Video's 'The Test' – he maintains an affinity for the UK.\n\nPrior to making his Test debut in the 2021-22 Ashes series in Australia, Carey played with Sussex in the UK county competition and is keen to return to Britain for another stint should his playing schedule allow.\n\n\"I definitely want to head back to England and play eventually,\" he said.\n\n\"I love it, and I love playing cricket over there.\n\n\"We'll see how it all plays out but I definitely see myself playing some county or T20 cricket there in the future.\"\n\nAustralians in the 2024 MLC\n\nLA Knight Riders: Adam Zampa, Spencer Johnson, Alex Carey\n\nMI New York: Tim David\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Pat Cummins, Josh Inglis, Matt Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Brody Couch (domestic signing)\n\nSeattle Orcas: Nathan, Ellis, Lance Morris, Cameron Gannon (domestic signing)\n\nTexas Super Kings: Aaron Hardie, Cameron Stevenson (domestic signing)"

        "body": "Jones' 40-ball 94 was an eye-opener as his team notched a convincing seven-wicket victory over rivals Canada here, beginning the home team's campaign on a rousing note in a tournament they are hosting for the first time, along with the West Indies.\n\nJones, whose place in the T20I side was under scrutiny and was released by Major League Cricket franchise Seattle Orcas after its inaugural edition, said he showed he was \"good enough\" to play at the highest level. He was not picked in the last MLC draft.\n\n\"When I wasn't selected in the Major League, I just took it as a stepping stone in the journey,\" he said.\n\n\"I would have loved to get drafted, so it goes sometimes. Hopefully tonight's innings will probably open the eyes of those who don't know me or USA cricket.\n\n\"We have great players here and that we have a lot of talent here and are willing to play at the highest level for sure.\"\n\nSet a target of 195, USA stuttered initially, losing opener Steven Taylor for zero in the second ball of the innings, and were 42/2 after 6.3 overs.\n\nBut Jones had other ideas as he came up with a counter-attacking innings to script a memorable win with as many as 14 balls to spare.\n\n\"I don't think it is easy to put it into words. We know Canada come hard against us since it is a big rivalry. Happy to take the team over the line,\" said Jones.\n\nJones smashed 10 sixes on the day, the second most in a T20 World Cup innings behind West Indian Chris Gayle's 11 against England in 2016.\n\n\"Sometimes as a cricketer, you could go a bit under the radar if you have a few low scores,\" Jones said. \"I always back myself and know that I am capable of performing at every level. happy that I came out on top and won the game for USA.\n\n\"Hope it opens the eyes of some people around the world that I am good enough to play T20 cricket.\n\n\"I believe in myself, I work hard and I just use as motivation. I know that I'm good enough to play at the highest level, and whenever given the opportunity, I'll do my best for sure.\n\n\"When I went out to bat tonight, I just saw it as another game to fight for me and bring my team as close as possible to the line, and if we get as close as possible to the line and over the line, it's great for the team.\"\n\nDespite losing two early wickets, Jones said he was confident of chasing down the total with their long batting lineup. He got a helping hand from Andries Gous, who made 65 off 46 balls in a 131-run partnership with Jones.\n\n\"With our batting line-up, knew anything under 200 is chaseable. Outfield and pitch were good and we knew that,\" said Jones after USA's highest run chase in T20Is.\"\n\nUSA will next take on Pakistan at the same venue on Thursday and play India in ten days' time, while Canada face Ireland in New York on Friday.\n\nJones said they will continue to play fearless cricket.\n\n\"We just want to keep winning as much as possible, of course we can't win every single game for the rest of our lives.\n\n\"I don't think our plan is going to change much. We want to play fearless cricket, we want to play hard cricket, we want to play smart cricket.\n\n\"We are going into the Pakistan game with the same mindset. We want to play fearless cricket, regardless of who we play against.\"\n\nAll praise for Jones, USA skipper Monank Patel said: \"We've always known, he has the game. He played fearless cricket and backing his shots. It was clean hitting.\n\n\"We want to continue the way we are playing. Don't want to change our fearless cricket whether we play Pakistan or India.\"\n\nCalling it a team effort, Patel said: \"The way we've been playing against Canada in previous series, I thought it was a whole team effort.\""

        "date": "Fri Jun  7 15:52:00 2024",
        "body": "Synopsis\n\nIn 2013, Nosthush Kenjige, disillusioned after failing to break into Karnataka's cricket scene despite rigorous training, returned to the US with a biotechnology degree. His passion for cricket reignited in New York, leading to his rise in the USA national team and impressive performances in Major League Cricket. Key to his journey was catching Dwayne Bravo's eye at the US Open T20. Kenjige now stars for the USA, notably taking crucial wickets in their stunning T20 World Cup victory over Pakistan.\n\nBack in 2013, Nosthush Kenjige shacked up in his PG room close to the CBD here, sulking. Then a 22-year-old, Kenjige was nowhere near fulfilling his dream of becoming a professional cricketer. A rigorous training at the Karnataka Institute of Cricket (KIOC) notwithstanding, Kenjige, one of the stars in USA's stunning win over Pakistan in the ongoing T20 World Cup, was not even close to breaking into the state cricketing eco-system.\n\nLatest from the Election Surpirse\n\nLok Sabha Elections: Track all the political movements Live\n\nThe fine print of Das & Co's first post poll policy\n\nShah, Nadda hash out deals with allies as Jun 9 looms\n\nFilled with disillusion, Kenjige, a US citizen by birth, returned to his mother nation armed with a degree in bio-technology from Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering.\n\nHis passion for cricket was not extinct but remained dormant as Kenjige explored a career in medical equipment inspection in New York.\n\n\"It was a phase I was merely floating around without much aim. But a year so later, I joined Columbia Cricket Club in NY, and that sort of reignited my desire to pursue cricket,\" said Kenjige, who was here on a personal visit a few months back.\n\nIrfan Sait, his early coach at the KIOC, said Kenjige made a timely return to the USA.\n\n\"He was talented for sure. He used to put in a lot of hard work at nets and played in the state league too. But as it happens here, thousands of cricketers want to break into the Karnataka state cricket team. Some will make it, some won't and Nosh, unfortunately, could not make it but that was no reflection of his talent or work ethics.\n\n\"When he decided to go back to the USA, I thought it was a good move and thought he may get to play at a higher level there,\" said Sait.\n\nIt was not a wrong assumption either. Kenjige rose through the ranks quite quickly in the next few years, earning a central contract with the USA national team and signed up for MI New York in the Major League Cricket.\n\nIn fact, the left-arm spinner was quite impressive for his side taking six wickets from as many matches at an outstanding economy rate of 5.76. His wickets included some top batters like Martin Guptill.\n\n\"The experience really helped me because it improved my confidence of standing up to bigger players and occasions,\" said Kenjige.\n\nBut there was a stroke of luck for Kenjige as former West Indian player Dwayne Bravo took notice of him at the US Open T20 tournament, an annual cricket exhibition event in Florida where some top cricketers from around the world participate.\n\nAli Khan, the USA teammate of Kenjige, too was picked by Bravo, who has an excellent eye for talent, during that tournament at the Cricketplex resort.\n\nSometimes minute moments can irrevocably change the course of someone's career or life and Kenjige admitted this as his turning point.\n\n\"I never thought that would change the whole course. It was a good spell but never thought that it would propel me into a bigger league.\n\n\"I had to do 800 hours of community service to be eligible to play for the USA, including teaching young cricketers, but all that effort was worth it when I made my national debut,\" said Kenjige.\n\nThe big day came in 2019 when Kenjige stepped on to the field against UAE, and since then he has played 40 ODIs and seven T20Is, including the one against Pakistan in New York on Thursday.\n\nKenjige grabbed the wickets of Usman Khan, Azam Khan and Shadab Khan to break Pakistan's charge in the middle overs.\n\nThe 33-year-old might have foreseen his glory day when he spoke about the need to exploit the chances.\n\n\"Coming from an Associate team, we don't often get chances to play against big teams. So, we need to ensure to grab those chances with both hands once they come our way. It's a tight situation but that's the challenging part for players like us,\" noted Kenjige, who was the USA's highest wicket-taker in the ICC Qualifiers last year.\n\nOne more challenge will come Kenjige's way on June 12 when USA face India, the country of his parents Pradeep and Keerthi.\n\n\"During those years (in Karnataka), I was ready to move away from cricket. But destiny has taken me to a different route, but one that I always wanted to travel,\" he signed off.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Sikkim Election Results News,Arunachal Pradesh Election Result News Election Results News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Sikkim Election Results News,Arunachal Pradesh Election Result News Election Results News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless"

        "date": "Tue Jun  4 09:53:00 2024",
        "body": "The USA had played the first international cricket match in history, back in 1844, but the sport had faded away after the First World War. Of late, however, there has been a conscious effort to make the sport popular in the nation again – through the Major League Cricket, the 2024 T20 World Cup, and a return of cricket in the Olympics after 128 years, in 2028 at Los Angeles.\n\nThe USA are co-hosting the 2024 T20 World Cup along with two-time champions West Indies. Eight matches, including the marquee India-Pakistan clash, will be played at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, while the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas and the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill will host four games each.\n\n“I’m unbelievably excited about going and watching a game in New York because I've just come back from the IPL where everybody is talking about you know the biggest game in cricket happening in New York,” said Eoin Morgan in conversation with Mel Farrell on the Wisden Cricket Weekly podcast.\n\nPart of the ICC commentary team at the World Cup, Morgan spoke about New York hosting a match featuring India and his former team, Ireland: “It’s going to be great to see India playing against the Men in Green, Ireland. I’m going to be there at that game as a fan, not as a commentator, and there are a few of my friends attending as well.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a great spectacle and a huge opportunity, when you think of the MLC last year being a success and sort of raising awareness about the opportunity that cricket could pose in the States.\n\n“You get a lot of people in England saying, ‘Well, do you think it will work?’ The answer is it’s already worked. I’m sorry, we’re already late to the party. When you have players having to choose between their home tournament and a tournament abroad, a player will always pick his home tournament if they you know if the opportunity is right. If the contract is right, there’s not one person that I’ve ever played cricket with that would turn down a big opportunity at home over something else.\"\n\nThe MLC's pull as a tournament is expanding. Former England opener Jason Roy will play there instead of the second half of the T20 Blast group stage (the English domestic T20 competition), while several high profile Australians are likely to compete in the second edition of the American franchise competition as well.\n\n“So, you have to give credit where credit is due. They’ve launched a good tournament [MLC] in the lead into this year’s World Cup. Over the last four months, we’ve seen social media reaction of the Nassau County international Cricket Stadium, which is just amazing. You really do get the impression following American sport in general that if they commit to something, they are all in. I get the feeling about that this World Cup is no different. So yeah, it will be brilliant.”"

        "date": "Thu Jun  6 07:41:22 2024",
        "body": "Cricket is spreading its wings. Someone like the great Vivian Richards, the West Indian legend, had some years ago wished that this should happen after his experience of seeing the huge enthusiasm for the sport, particularly the T20 variety in the Gulf region. Now the big-time event in cricket, the T20 world cup has arrived in the USA which along with West Indies are hosting this marquee championship this time. Not that cricket is new to America, the Major League Cricket is there and indeed India and West Indies had played a few matches of their 2016 and 2023 T20 series there. But for a country which has hosted the Olympics multiple times and even the World Cup football (1994), this will be a first, a World Cup cricket on its soil. What better indication than that, thanks to the T20 version, cricket is truly becoming a global event if not still comparable yet to soccer. But the big march has begun. Indeed, the USA would look at this major championship as one more effort to strengthen the interest for this sport in the country and there is another reason. The 2028 edition of the Olympics is to be hosted by the USA and cricket (men and women) is one of the disciplines planned.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nThat much for USA’s interest and enthusiasm but for the cricket lovers around the world it is another occasion to delve into the thrills of the bat and ball that T20 always promises. The just concluded IPL, a hugely accepted event, perhaps world over, gave a sample of what cricket excitement can be all about. The venue now changes to a larger locale spread over two countries, one, the West Indies a traditionally big power in the sport. Picturesque settings are in place to match the high-quality cricket expected with around a third of the 55 matches scheduled in three cities in America. Twenty teams are in the fray including the three debutants, host USA, Canada and Uganda. All three gained acceptance by dint of their fine performances. USA, automatic entrant as host, had last month carved out a 2-1 win against Bangladesh in a T20 series, Canada in the warm up campaign had a significant win over Nepal while Uganda gained notice after finishing second in the T20 world cup Africa qualifier. What will be their influence on the big stage amidst the seasoned campaigners will be one area of curious interest for the cricket aficionados.\n\nWhatever flashes that the newcomers or lesser-known nations can throw up in the course of the championship it still becomes difficult to see anything beyond the fancied teams to make the super eight phase, where starts the true fight for supremacy. Here again, considering the way T20 can surprise and shock, there can never be a true prediction of who would lift the coveted Cup. Evidence of this can be seen in the way results had panned out from the time (2007) this Cup was instituted. Since the inaugural edition was held in South Africa, six teams had won the title with West Indies and England the only ones to lift the Cup twice each.\n\nAll said and done, close matches should be the feature with some big hitting the highlight. Already USA gave a glimpse of its capability with a convincing win over Canada in the championship opener. USA’s Aaron Jones must have been the toast of the home team supporters with his free-wheeling unbeaten 40-ball 94 that had ten hits over the fence! That probably sets the tone as every day from now on surely would promise many more spectacles of this kind and more. Perhaps the initial look out for fans would be the much publicised India-Pakistan encounter. An assured high voltage drama when the two face each other, this time too it should not any less. One thing it can be said with certainty there would be more eyeballs for this than perhaps any other contest!\n\nThis is not to put in the shade the abilities of the others like Australia, England, New zealand, West Indies, Sri Lanka and South Africa. India fans will in particular not forget what Australia can do having seen it grab the ODI world cup title in Ahmedabad last year. Having recorded ten straight wins before coming to the final, many had expected a home team triumph. The huge stadium was filled to capacity but in the end it was Travis Head who did the impossible, ensuring a grand victory for Australia and leaving the fans dumbstruck. Head who was a delight in the IPL will be there for more heroics. Not that India does not have its own heroes but the day’s performance that will be the key to everything around success. Still India has an additional pressure of being ranked number one even if history has not been too kind to it here. Except for winning the inaugural edition in 2007, India has hardly sparkled barring finishing runner up to Sri Lanka in 2014.\n\nMuch interest surrounds West Indies, considering the talents from this country have had good time in franchise cricket the world over. Besides, West Indies in the run up to the World cup had come up with a convincing 3-0 win over South Africa in a T20 series. That should have done the side a world of good in confidence. There is then much to look forward to even as the USA settles down to becoming an important centre for this sport in the seasons to come. Good for cricket, as they say."

The move comes after Stoinis put forth an exceptional performance against Chennai Super Kings, playing for Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL 2024.\n\nStoinis hit a blistering ton against CSK in the recently concluded IPL, and he will now be donning the same yellow jersey in the American avatar. Set to turn 35 years old in August 2024, Stoinis is currently a part of the Australia T20 World Cup 2024 squad but does not have a central contract with Cricket Australia.\n\nHaving played 14 games in the IPL 2024, Stoinis amassed 388 runs to his name, maintaining an average of 32.33 runs, and he even took four wickets to add to his brilliant season for LSG as well. It will be Stoinis’ second season in the MLC, as he had already featured for San Francisco Unicorns last year, and the star all-rounder will be keen on putting in his best performance.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Texas Super Kings will kick off their upcoming MLC campaign by taking on Los Angeles Knight Riders on July 5, and Stoinis will surely have many eyes set upon him. Furthermore, several Australian stars like Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head will be featured in MLC season 2.\n\nSpeaking of the same, MLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan recently came forward to reflect on how huge it is for the entire tournament to have signed such big names as Pat Cummins and Glenn Maxwell.\n\n\"Signing a world-class player like Pat Cummins is a testament to the calibre of talent the league is attracting, underscoring our global impact and the success of the inaugural season,” Srinivasan was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.\n\n\"It elevates the level of competition fans will get to see and experience on home soil and showcases our commitment to bringing the top-tier players in the world to play in America's very own league,” he added."

        "body": "Share\n\nAustralia's Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins will play in the second season of Major League Cricket, the Cricketer reported.\n\nThe 31-year-old is have signed four-year contract for the San Francisco Unicorns franchise, who share a strategic relationship with Victoria's first-class set-up in Australia.\n\nThe franchise made announcement on the social platforms.\n\nFive days after the T20 World Cup concludes, Cummins will join his new squad in time for the MLC competition.\n\nThis stint in the MLC will mark the culmination of a demanding yet successful season for Cummins. It all started in February with Australia's tour of New Zealand, and in his first season as captain, he most recently led SRH to the IPL 2024 final.\n\nDespite Hyderabad's defeat at the hands of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the summit match, Cummins' leadership qualities are evident. Along with winning the 2023 World Test Championship (WTC) and ODI World Cup, he helped the national side retain the Ashes in England with a 2-2 draw the previous year.\n\nHis signing heightened the tension between rival New South Wales and Victoria.\n\nIn February, Ricky Ponting was unveiled as the new head coach of Washington Freedom.\n\nFreedom are linked to Cricket NSW, which runs the team in partnership with Indian-American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil.\n\nThe two franchises are due to play each other on Monday, July 22nd in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nOther top Australian stars to have joined the tournament include Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith and Jake Fraser-McGurk.\n\nIt must be noted the tournament is scheduled to be held in the USA’s Texas and North Carolina from 5th to 28th July.\n\nMI New York are the defending champions. They defeated Seattle Orcas in the MLC 2023 final to claim the first Major League Cricket title.\n\nThe MLC 2024 season opener will see a rematch of last year’s final as MI New York take on Seattle Orcas once again at Church Street Park in North Carolina.\n\nLater on the same day, Texas Super Kings will host the LA Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.\n\nThe six teams will compete in 21 matches in a round-robin league format. The initial 15 matches will be split between the two venues - Church Street Park and Grand Prairie Stadium. However, the final six group matches and the knockout fixtures will all be held at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.\n\nThe teams will face each other once in the league phase, after which the top four sides will progress to the playoffs. The MLC 2024 final will take place at the Grand Prairie Stadium on 29th July.\n\nFour of the six MLC teams are owned by franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL). These include MI New York (Mumbai Indians), Texas Super Kings (Chennai Super Kings), LA Knight Riders (Kolkata Knight Riders), and the Seattle Orcas (Delhi Capitals). The other two teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom."

It’s a massive signing for the US-based league, which is making quick headways into the cricketing ecosystem.\n\nAccording to Cricbuzz, Cummins will replace Aaron Finch as the Unicorns’ captain. His captaincy credentials are over the roof after leading Australia to the ODI World Cup, the World Test Championship, and most recently, SunRisers Hyderabad to the final of IPL 2024. He has also evolved brilliantly as a T20 bowler.\n\nSeveral Australian players are already part of the MLC, including Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith, and Jake Fraser Mcgurk. A few more, like T20I captain Mitchell Marsh, are expected to join them soon. Former captain Ricky Ponting will also join Washington Freedom as head coach.\n\nThe Aussie interest in the competition seems to be hinging on the lighter workload. The second season will begin just five days after the ongoing 2024 T20 World Cup in the US and the West Indies but will last only three weeks.\n\nThis provides a perfect opportunity for cricketers to participate in a tournament without the long-term commitments of other leagues. With Cummins at the helm, the San Fransisco Unicorns are poised for an exciting season ahead in the MLC."

        "body": "According to the former right-arm pace bowler, T20 cricket in the United States of America is likely to become the next big thing.\n\nEngland’s former right-arm pace bowler Liam Plunkett, who was a part of England’s World Cup winning team in 2019, has revealed that T20 cricket in the United States of America is likely to become the next big thing. According to the former English player, the Major League Cricket (MLC) has received funding of 100 million sterling pounds from private investors such as Microsoft and Adobe.\n\nQuote\n\nPlunkett’s words\n\nPlunkett, who recently signed a three-year deal with Minor League Cricket’s Philadelphians, said, “It’s go big or go home. That is how they do stuff in America. And with the money that is behind this, it is going to be massive. I think it will explode.” The pacer who represented England in 89 ODIs and 22 T20Is also added that the upcoming T20 league will attract legendary cricketers from every corner of the world.\n\nInformation\n\nCricket in the USA\n\nCricket is a fast-emerging sport in the United States of America. Next year, the country will host its first-ever domestic T20 league and in 2024, the States will co-host the ICC T20 World Cup along with West Indies. Shahrukh Khan-owned Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders have acquired one of the six franchises. The six teams will represent six cities, such as Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC.\n\nPlunkett, who shifted to the States last year after retiring from English cricket, also added, “Americans want to watch the best and I think we can attract them. I think they will definitely jump on board when they see how big it is. With how many people love cricket here and the way Americans put on a show, you will get packed-out crowds. Hopefully, you will get people like Jonny Bairstow, Andre Russell, and all of these guys coming across to play. It is a lot of people’s dream to play the sport in America.”\n\nAccording to a report, the MLC is constructing six venues that are in line with the standards of the International Cricket Council (ICC). “The first will open in Grand Prairie, Dallas County next year and will be the main venue for MLC’s inaugural season with a permanent capacity of up to 9,000, increased to 12,000 with temporary seating,” the report added."
