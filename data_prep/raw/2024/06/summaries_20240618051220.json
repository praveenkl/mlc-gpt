        "text": "**Current Status:** The MLC has completed its inaugural season with 6 teams: Texas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C, Seattle, and New York.\n\n**Expansion Plans:** There is no specific timeline for expansion, but the MLC hopes to reach 10 teams in the long term, with Chicago, Atlanta, and Canadian cities (Vancouver and Toronto) being possible expansion locations. Houston is also considered a potential location.\n\n**Requirements for Expansion:** Before expanding, the MLC wants to develop a larger pool of American cricket talent and cultivate domestic players.\n\n**Season Structure:** The upcoming season will feature 6 overseas players per team, with a goal to comply with International Cricket Council regulations in the future. The ultimate vision is for a 6-week season from early June to mid-July, with a home-and-away format, but this will depend on all teams having their own home grounds.\n\n**Current Season:** The entire tournament will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina, with hopes to use the new modular stadium in New York in the future.\n\n**Outlook:** The MLC is riding the momentum from the T20 World Cup and hopes to build on its success in the second season, with a focus on developing American cricket talent and expanding the league in the long term."
