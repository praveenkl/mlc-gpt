        "body": "A midsized Texas city between Dallas and Fort Worth has become an international destination thanks to its cricket stadium as the sport gains popularity stateside. More such venues are on the way.\n\nGrand Prairie’s 7,200-seat stadium is home to the Texas Super Kings, one of the six teams that played in the U.S.’ Major League Cricket during its inaugural season last year. About 50,000 people attended games during the two-week season and postseason, Grand Prairie City Manager Bill Hills told The New York Times.\n\nInvestors are increasingly interested in the growing audience for cricket, the world’s second-most-popular sport, which has an especially large South Asian audience, the NYT reported. Major League Cricket franchises the San Francisco Unicorns, the Los Angeles Knight Riders and the Seattle Orcas and their backers are all moving toward building new venues within the next few years.\n\nThe turnout to a dozen cricket games in Grand Prairie last year exceeded expectations, Hills told the NYT. The three-day playoffs in July generated $1.7M in economic activity, including hospitality, retail, dining and entertainment, he said.\n\n“Who would have thought a city like Grand Prairie would host international sporting events” watched by millions, Hills told the NYT.\n\nGrand Prairie in 2020 greenlighted plans to turn its former minor league baseball venue into the first Major League Cricket stadium in the country, hoping to capitalize on the 15 to 20 million cricket fans who were already estimated to be in the U.S.\n\nTwo years later, a group led by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gave Major League Cricket $120M to fund the construction of stadiums and training centers and host global cricket events in the U.S. over the following decade.\n\nThat vision is now coming to life as Major League Cricket zeroes in on building more 7,000-to-10,000-seat stadiums in areas that could bloom into entertainment districts, the NYT reported.\n\nCricket stadiums make a great anchor to attract people, David Demarest, who leads the sports and entertainment development group at JLL, told the NYT. That was part of the vision in Grand Prairie.\n\n“No question it is going to be something that can serve as a springboard to development. It is located in an opportunity zone,” Marty Wieder, former Grand Prairie director of economic development, said in 2022.\n\nThe city planned to draw on the 100,000 or so Indian American people living in DFW.\n\nAbout 250,000 people originally from India or elsewhere in South Asia live in the San Francisco Bay Area, Unicorns General Manager David White said of a proposed stadium in the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds. The Santa Clara site also hopes to attract a Major League Soccer stadium and more to become a sports and entertainment hub, the NYT reported.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas plan to build a stadium at Marymoor Park in Redmond, Washington, near Bellevue, and the Los Angeles Knight Riders are eyeing a spot at the Great Park in Irvine, California.\n\nVijay Srinivasan, a Bay Area entrepreneur who founded a cricket pay television channel, told the NYT the lack of cricket infrastructure in the U.S. is the main thing holding it back from hosting the most competitive games.\n\nEven so, Major League Cricket’s short season allowed many of the sport’s top players, including Australia's Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Pat Cummins, to play in the U.S. league last year."

They emerged victorious against Pakistan in a thrilling super-over, which put the team in a position to finish second in Group A of the marquee event. Ultimately, they were helped as their game against Ireland was abandoned due to rain.\n\nWith the USA set to face South Africa, West Indies, and England in Group 2 of the Super 8 round, Cognizant Major League Cricket's Chief Executive Vijay Srinivasan, said the advancement of the team to the next stage of the home World Cup is an incredible achievement.\n\n\"Congratulations to Team USA, who, in their first-ever World Cup appearance, gave us three thrilling matches of cricket against the world's best teams and earned their position in the Super 8. This is a historic moment for the sport, especially for our players from Major League Cricket who are representing the USA. We hope that this inspires boys and girls around the country to pick up a bat and ball this summer, and encourages sports fans to attend an MLC game or tune into the broadcast,\" Srinivasan said as quoted by the MLC release.\n\n\"The USA's advancement to the Super 8 means they'll automatically qualify for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, providing Major League Cricket with a strong platform for continued growth,\" he added.\n\nMLC's six teams; Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, and Washington Freedom, boast some of the world's best international and domestic talent who are readying to represent their respective countries in the World Cup.\n\n\"MLC has already revolutionized the cricket landscape in the USA.

There’s an even bigger sport in town.\n\nThis week, Major League Cricket will play its first-ever game in the U.S. and every last ticket to the highly anticipated opener has been sold. (Don’t worry, it’s also being broadcast live.) The Texas Super Kings will face off against the Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Thursday. The 6,000-person venue replaced the former home of the professional baseball team, the AirHogs. Anurag Jain, the managing partner of venture capitalist firm Perot Jain, is part-owner of the Texas Super Kings and founded the Dallas-based franchise earlier this year in hopes of creating a buzz stateside.\n\nMore from Robb Report\n\nThe Texas Food Scene Can't Decide Whether It Wants a Michelin Guide\n\nA Thief Stole $600,000 Worth of Wine From This L.A. Bottle Shop\n\nThis $37 Million Tuscan-Inspired Estate in Los Angeles Will Transport You to the 1920s Italian Countryside\n\n“My vested interest was to bring cricket right into the heart of America,” Jain told Bloomberg. “I see a lot of cricket being played one off, club level, league level, at the local levels. But not at the professional level and that’s what I really wanted to change.”\n\nCricket is currently ranked as the second-biggest sport in the world right behind soccer, and Jain’s not the only one betting on its future. Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside business mogul Jay Mehta, acquired the Knight Riders back in 2020 and has plans to build his own state-of-the-art cricket stadium 40 miles outside L.A. The $30 million venture is being spearheaded by Major League Cricket and designed by award-winning architecture firm HKS.\n\nHistorically, the bat and ball sport has struggled to develop a fan base outside of India, South Africa, Australia, and the U.K. However, deep-pocketed investors are willing to put an impressive $120 million into the U.S. league to expand its profile in America, Bloomberg reported.\n\nOf course, with this kind of financial backing, cricketers from across the globe want in on the action. The Texas Super Kings have since signed overseas players including Devon Conway, Dwayne Bravo, and David Miller. Veteran South African batter Faf du Plessis has also joined the team as captain, while West Indies spinner Sunil Narine leads the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n“American sports fans want to see the best in the world,” MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport. “That’s the demand in U.S. professional sports.”\n\nSign up for Robb Report's Newsletter.
