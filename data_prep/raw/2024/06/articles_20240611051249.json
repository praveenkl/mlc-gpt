        "body": "Two enterprise data protection companies, one old, one new – both public – are sponsoring two US cricket teams.\n\nNewly public Rubrik is the official cybersecurity sponsor for the San Francisco Unicorns’ Major League Cricket (MLC) season starting July 5 this year. The Unicorns’ roster features World Cup winners and global talents from international teams including Australia, Pakistan, and New Zealand. Long-time public company Commvault is an associate sponsor of the defending champions of Major League Cricket, MI New York, where Accenture is the principal sponsor. MI (Mumbai Indians) New York is a T20 cricket team established in 2023. The T20 format is shorter and, hopefully, faster paced than world test cricket games, entailing just 20 overs per innings.\n\nRubrik CMO Andres Botero said: “Unicorns are unique, special – a phenomenon. This notable Bay Area team brings innovation, excellence, and resilience to the cricket pitch, making this partnership a perfect match.”\n\nRubrik said it shares a common philosophy with the SF Unicorns built around a commitment to recruiting exceptional talent, delivering innovation, and relentlessness. Rubrik’s brand will be prominently displayed on the Unicorns’ team assets and uniforms throughout the season.\n\nSF Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman said: “Rubrik is exactly the kind of game-changing Unicorn the team is named for. This agreement is a testament to our shared commitment to excellence through talent, innovation and teamwork.”\n\nCommvault CMO Anna Griffin also said in a statement: “Sponsoring the MI New York cricket team is Commvault’s opportunity to support one of the most dynamic and fast-growing sports in the world. It’s a no-brainer.”\n\nCommvault’s sponsorship will feature opportunities to engage with fans including exclusive watch parties, contests, and cricket clinics with professional players. Fans, partners, and customers will also have the chance to join these events in the Dallas and Morrisville stadiums.\n\nGriffin said: “This partnership not only allows us to engage with cricket fans but also reinforces our dedication to fostering community and resilience. We’re excited to share the Commvault spirit and support the MI New York team on their journey. We’re thrilled to connect with cricket fans and bring the Commvault spirit to the pitch.”\n\nCommvault said cricket is the second most watched sport globally, with more than 2.5 billion fans. As cricket’s popularity surges in the United States, Commvault’s collaboration with MI New York aims to bring the thrill of the game to a broader, more diverse audience. In Commvault’s view, it serves as an opportunity to educate an untapped global fan base about the importance of resilience – critical knowledge that is applicable to both personal and professional life, whether on the pitch or in a Commvault Cleanroom defending against cyberattacks.\n\nMumbai Indians play in the Indian Premier League and is owned by Indiawin Sports Pvt. Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, one of India’s largest conglomerates. MI is a global cricketing force, with five T20 teams spanning three continents, and four countries including both men and women.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns, in partnership with MLC, plan to build a world-class home for the team in the Bay Area, which will seat up to 15,000 people and be capable of hosting major international cricket events. The team’s primary investors are Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, who are founding partners of data-driven venture firm rocketship.vc, and previously founded US-focused database technology provider Junglee, which was sold to Amazon in 1998 for $250 million."

        "body": "(Reuters) - Batsman Jason Roy has given up his incremental contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to play in the inaugural edition of the United States' new Twenty20 tournament - Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nRoy, who was an integral part of the England side which won the 2019 one-day World Cup, was dropped from a full contract to an incremental one in October.\n\nThe incremental contracts are given to players who may feature for England on a less predictable basis.\n\n\"The ECB have agreed for him to play in the competition (MLC) on the proviso that he gives up the remainder of his ECB incremental contract, which both parties have agreed to,\" the ECB said on Thursday.\n\n\"The ECB wish to clarify that this decision will not affect Jason’s selection for England teams going forward. We have absolute confidence and faith that Jason is committed to England cricket.\"\n\nIn a statement on social media, Roy said he would never \"walk away from England\".\n\n\"I've had clear and supportive conversations with the ECB about participating in Major League Cricket. The ECB were happy with me to play in the competition as long as they didn't have to pay me for the remainder of the contractual year,\" Roy said.\n\n\"As a single format player with no central contract I wanted to take the opportunity to play this competition as there are currently no scheduling conflicts with England. It benefits me as an England player to play as much competitive cricket as possible.\n\n\"Just to be very clear, my priority is England cricket, especially with a World Cup soon upon us. It is for me, and for any player, the greatest honour to receive a cap to play for their country.\"\n\nThe six-team MLC tournament will be played between July 13-30 in Dallas, while the 50-overs Cricket World Cup will take place in India in October and November.\n\nAccording to an ESPNCricinfo report, Roy is set to play for the Los Angeles Knight Riders in MLC.\n\n(Reporting by Aadi Nair in Nashik, India; Editing by Toby Davis)"

        "body": "Cricket in the United StatesCountryUnited StatesGoverning bodyUSA CricketNational team(s)United StatesFirst playedbefore 1700\n\nNational competitions\n\nInternational competitions\n\nCricket in the United States is a sport played at the amateur, club, intercollegiate and international competition levels with little popularity, with 200,000 players (<0.1% of the population) across the country.[1] Major League Cricket is the highest level of domestic T20 cricket currently played in America, with T20 being the format of the game that much of the recent growth in American cricket is occurring in.[2][3]\n\nIn 2006 it was estimated that 30,000 people in the United States play or watch cricket annually.[4] By 2017, this figure had risen to 200,000 people playing cricket in 6,000 teams.[5] Cricket in the United States is not as popular as baseball and is not as popular among as large a fraction of the population as it is within either the Commonwealth nations or the other ICC full member (or Test cricket) nations.[6] There are at least two historical reasons for the relative obscurity of cricket within the United States. One reason was the 19th-century-rise of the summer time bat-and-ball sport now called baseball, which displaced cricket as a popular pastime.[6] Another reason was that in 1909 when the ICC was originally organized as the Imperial Cricket Conference it was open only to Commonwealth nations and thereby excluded the U.S. from participating in the sport at the highest level.[7]\n\nNevertheless, in 1965 the U.S. was admitted to the renamed ICC as an associate member and the sport grew in popularity in the second half of the 20th century. An oft mentioned reason for the growing popularity of cricket is the growing population of immigrants to the U.S. who come from cricket playing nations.[4][6]\n\nWith the launching of the United States Youth Cricket Association in 2010, a more focused effort to bring the game to American schools was begun, with the intention of broadening cricket's fan base beyond expatriates and their children.[8] In addition, USA Cricket has begun offering various championship tournaments for youth cricketers, such as the MLC Jr. Championship.[9]\n\nESPN has been stepping up its coverage of cricket in recent years, buying the cricket website Cricinfo in 2007, and broadcasting the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 competition, the 2014 Indian Premier League, English County Championship games, and international Test cricket.[10]\n\nIn 2021, Minor League Cricket, a professional Twenty20 cricket league sanctioned by USA Cricket, began play. Major League Cricket is planning to launch its first season in 2023.[11][12] In addition, various championships and pathways are being offered for youth cricketers, such as the MLC Jr. Championship.[13]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nCricket was played by British colonists in North America by the start of the 18th century.[14] Archived references to cricket played in America date from 1709. A New York newspaper from 1739 contains an advertisement for cricket players and the first documented competition occurred in 1751 in Manhattan.[15] According to William Byrd II's diary, cricket was played on the slave plantations of Virginia, including on his Westover estate among neighbors and slaves.[16] By 1793, Dartmouth College students were playing cricket on the Green.[17]\n\nPhiladelphia was the crucible of North American cricket and remains so today.[4] Haverford College formed a cricket team in 1833, generally accepted as the first cricket club exclusively for Americans.[18] Haverford and the University of Pennsylvania formed a strong rivalry, with the first match played on May 7, 1864, believed to be start of the third-oldest intercollegiate sporting contest in America, after the 1852 Harvard-Yale crew and 1859 Amherst-Williams baseball matches.[19] Haverford and Penn then proceeded to play each other for three consecutive years until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds.[20] From 1875 and through 1880, Haverford College, Columbia College and University of Pennsylvania fielded a varsity elevens, which played a few matches each year against each other and other club teams.[21]\n\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association,[22] which Cornell University later joined.[23] During the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924) Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the de facto national championship) 23 times (3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford), Haverford won such championship 19 times (3 shared with Penn and Harvard, 1 shared with Penn and Cornell, and 1 shared with Penn), and Harvard won it 6 times, none after 1899 (3 shared with Haverford and Penn).[24][circular reference][25]\n\nIn July 1895 an international cricket match between Canada and the United States was played on the Manheim grounds in Germantown section of Philadelphia with six of the United States team being Penn student athletes and, in September of that year, past and then current members of Penn's varsity cricket team played past and then current members of the English cricket teams of Oxford and Cambridge resulting in Penn defeating the Oxford-Cambridge team by one hundred runs.[23] This was not surprising as in the last two and a half decades of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century, Philadelphia was the center of cricket in the United States[26] Cricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the Merion Cricket Club and the Germantown Cricket Club).\n\nThe eleven-person team cricket familiar with Americans today took root most effectively at the St. George's Cricket Club, founded in 1838.[16] Clubs from the United States (St. George's CC) and Canada participated in one of the first international cricket matches on record in 1844 in Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan.[27][28] Cricket received a significant amount of media coverage at the time. In the mid-19th century, the sport was played in approximately 125 cities in 22 states. Roughly 500 officially established clubs existed and it is probable that in 1860 there were 10,000 boys and men in America who had actively played the sport for at least a season.[15]\n\nSt. George's CC employed Sheffield native Samuel Wright as its professional cricket playing groundsman. Wright's two sons, Harry and George, played for the United States XXII against the All England XI in 1859 in New York and Philadelphia.[29] Both Wright brothers became renowned in baseball circles after they played for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, America's first professional baseball team.[29] English cricket teams toured American regularly. Richard Daft's England side visited in 1869, when they played in New York and Philadelphia. Then with the spread of cricket to Boston, Lord Hawke's England XI played George Wright's New England Cricket XI at the Longwood Country Club in Boston. On the same tour in 1891 Lord Hawke's XI defeated a Germantown CC XI in Philadelphia, which included George Patterson, regarded as America's best batsman, with several centuries to his credit. George Patterson – referred to as America's W.G. Grace – was an American-born cricketer and lawyer by profession, described as brilliant under pressure when facing first-class English sides.[29]\n\nIt may have been during the Civil War that baseball overtook cricket and secured its place as America's game.[30] An army making a brief stop at a location could easily organise a game of baseball on almost any clear patch of ground, while cricket required a carefully prepared pitch. After the Civil War, baseball became a much more organized sport than cricket in America, with more money and competition available to baseball players across the country;[31][32] thus, baseball began to poach players and administrators from the world of cricket. It has been suggested that the fast-paced quick play of baseball was more appealing to Americans than the technical slower game of cricket,[30] which at the time was played over a much longer duration than baseball;[33] some attempts were made to nativize cricket in a way that would reduce its length and other perceived disadvantages relative to baseball, such as the American innovation of wicket, a variation of cricket which could be played in an afternoon.[34][35] However, the natural tendency toward baseball was compounded by terrible American defeats at the hands of a traveling English side in 1859, which may have caused Americans to think that they would never be successful at this English game.[36] By the end of the Civil War, most cricket fans had given up their hopes of broad-based support for the game. Baseball filled the role of the \"people's game\" and cricket became an amateur game for gentlemen.[30][37]\n\nGoverning bodies[edit]\n\nThe United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) previously served as the governing body for cricket in the United States, as an associate member of the ICC from 1965 to 2017. The USACA faced turmoil and governance issues in the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2005 the USACA was suspended from the ICC's annual conference due to issues with the association's election process, but that suspension was lifted in March 2006.[38] In February 2006, a competing commercial body, Major League Cricket (MLC), proposed that it replace the USACA as the United States' representative in the ICC, citing its more substantial efforts in developing the sport in the country (especially at grassroots levels such as schools, which the USACA had ignored), and accused the USACA of having \"the morbid opinion that they do not need any outside assistance whereas the development of the game.\"[39][40]\n\nThe USACA was suspended by the ICC in 2007 for its failure to adopt a constitution and hold elections in a timely manner, and the U.S. team pulled out of the World Cricket League Division Three.[41] The organization was suspended once again in 2015, citing \"significant concerns about the governance, finance, reputation and cricketing activities\" of the organization. However, the U.S. team was still allowed to continue competing in events such as the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, with ICC Americas serving as an interim caretaker of its cricket operations.[42][43] In 2017, the ICC voted to expel the USACA, citing its increasing debt and failure to ratify a certified constitution.[42]\n\nIn January 2019, a new body known as USA Cricket was approved as a new associate member of the ICC, replacing the USACA as the United States' representative.[44][45]\n\nNational teams[edit]\n\nMen's team[edit]\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. men's team was promoted to Division Two of the World Cricket League for the first time.[46] In 2019, the United States qualified for the inaugural season of its replacement, the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, whose top teams will move on to the qualifier for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.[47][48] On November 16, 2021, the ICC announced that the United States and West Indies would co-host the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup.[49] It will be the first ICC World Cup tournament to feature matches played in the United States - with three venues finalized in New York, Florida & Texas.[50]\n\nIn December 2021, the United States hosted Ireland in a T20I and ODI series, which marked the country's first-ever home series against a Test-playing nation.[51][52] The two teams split the T20 series.[53][54] However, the ODI series was cancelled due to COVID-19 issues.[55]\n\nWomen's team[edit]\n\nIn November 2021, the United States won the 2021 Women's T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier, advancing to the global qualifier for the 2023 Women's T20 World Cup.[56]\n\nDomestic competitions[edit]\n\nThere have been various attempts at domestic cricket leagues in the United States: Pro Cricket was formed in 2004 as a commercial cricket league not sanctioned by the ICC, which played a modified T20 format with changes intended to further increase the pace of the game, including five-ball overs.[57] The USACA, later in partnership with New Zealand Cricket, proposed a T20 competition known as the American Premier League, patterned after competitions such as the Indian Premier League. It was announced in 2009, but never came to fruition.[58][59] The American Twenty20 Championship was later held in 2011 as a three-day event in New Jersey between regional teams, to help develop and promote American players.[60]\n\nVia the investment arm American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), USA Cricket has sanctioned the domestic T20 league Minor League Cricket, and plans to launch the professional competition Major League Cricket (no relation to the aforementioned organization) in 2023.[61]\n\nInternational competitions[edit]\n\nOn November 16, 2021, the International Cricket Council announced that the United States along with the West Indies will co-host the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, making the first ICC World Cup Tournament to take place in the United States.[62][63] Team USA upset Team Pakistan in the 2024 Cricket World Cup.[64]\n\nCricket grounds[edit]\n\nThere are only a few purpose-built cricket grounds in the United States, they include the Germantown Cricket Club Ground and the Philadelphia Cricket Club Ground[65] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Randolph St. George Walker Park on Staten Island, New York; the Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill, Florida; and the Leo Magnus Cricket Complex in Van Nuys, California.\n\nThe Indianapolis World Sports Park in Indianapolis, Indiana, which features cricket grounds, was completed in 2014, and hosted the USACA's national championship that year.[66]\n\nThe game is also played on a number of shared purpose venues, they include Van Cortlandt Stadium in Bronx, New York and others.\n\nIn 2021, American Cricket Enterprises leased AirHogs Stadium, the home field of the defunct Texas AirHogs baseball team, to redevelop it as a cricket-specific stadium and USA Cricket training facility.[61] The revamped stadium was completed in 2023 and it was named as Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nThe main cricket grounds in the United States include:\n\nCentral Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill - Hosted 4 T20I since 2010. It is the home ground for the Ft. Lauderdale Lions in Minor League Cricket. It is also scheduled to host a few matches during the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie - The stadium is used for the Major League Cricket matches, it is also home ground for the Texas Super Kings.
