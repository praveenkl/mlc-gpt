        "body": "America’s Major League Cricket Granted Official List-A Status By ICC\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA (IANS) – The Major League Cricket (MLC) was granted official List-A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) ahead of its second season, which commences on July 5.\n\nThe list A status, which comes after a successful inaugural season, recognizes MLC as an official T20 league and America’s ﬁrst world-class domestic tournament.\n\n“Now, every century, half-century, ‘ﬁve-for’, run-out, win, loss, and championship will be documented as official career statistics in an internationally recognized format of the game. This will also provide local US players and upcoming stars of the game the opportunity for international recognition, furthering the development of domestic talent by the MLC,” MLC’s official release read.\n\nMLC is the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States.\n\n“We saw cricket mania sweep across the US last year off the back of our inaugural season of Major League Cricket. Now, we take exciting momentum into the highly anticipated ICC T20 World Cup and season two of the MLC. With an unforgettable summer of cricket on our doorstep, we’re ready to capture the hearts of American sports fans with our thrilling, adrenaline-charged game that is the most exciting emerging T20 tournament across the globe,” said MLC CEO, Vijay Srinivasan.\n\nExclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, MLC showcases superstar players from around the globe, bringing world-class T20 cricket to America.\n\nThe inaugural season that occurred in the summer of 2023 had featured six teams: Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, and the Washington Freedom."

        "body": "(ESPN) Major League Cricket (MLC), the season-old T20 tournament in the USA, has become the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire List A status from the ICC, following on from the UAE’s ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThe status means that MLC will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics. “We are really excited for the news as it’s a recognition of the standard and high quality of players taking part in the tournament,” tournament director Justin Geale told ESPNcricinfo. “By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale.\n\n“The most important part for me though is it ensures the performances of some of the world’s best players alongside their peers are adequately reflected in their career statistics.\n\n“Really thankful to the ICC for taking the time to look at it as cricket in the USA doesn’t always fit into a template. We are an Associate nation and proud of that, one with a unique opportunity in front of us. It’s our hope that on the back of the upcoming World Cup and a successful season we can continue to build a platform for the sport to grow and ultimately succeed in the USA.”\n\nThe 2024 edition of MLC will start on July 5, a week after the T20 World Cup ends on June 29 in Bridgetown. The T20 World Cup begins, however, in Dallas, USA on June 1, in what is an important season in the game’s continuing efforts to crack the US market.\n\nThe Guardian, which reported on the awarding of List A status on Monday, also revealed MLC’s plans to expand from the current six teams to 10 over the next few years, jumping from 19 games in 2023 to 34 by 2025. Twenty-five games have already been scheduled for this season.\n\n“It was always intended to be a 10-team league,” MLC’s chief executive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the Guardian. “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nSrinivasan said they wanted the league, which clashes with the Hundred in 2024, to start in early June in 2025.\n\n“Ultimately for us, our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,” Srinivasan said. “With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nAn early June start avoids a clash with the Hundred’s July-August window, but it could mean an overlap with the T20 Blast. This scheduling clash became a major talking point in the last English summer when Jason Roy opted out of his ECB contract to play in the MLC and went on to represent LA Knight Riders, who have the same owners as that of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), who won their third IPL title on Sunday.\n\nLast year, MLC ended two days before the start of the Hundred, though this time there will be an overlap of six days between the two leagues, with the MLC ending on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. As a result, as many as half of the overseas players in the Hundred could arrive in the UK late after the MLC ends. Twelve out of the 24 overseas players under contract in the men’s Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in MLC and more could follow before the tournament starts.\n\nFour of the six teams in the MLC are owned by IPL team owners – Mumbai Indians, KKR, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals.\n\nThe first season ran from July 13 to 31 with 15 group-stage games followed by four playoff matches, and ended with MI New York lifting the trophy under the captaincy of Nicholas Pooran. The second season will be played across the same two grounds which hosted the first season – the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and the Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville."

The pacer joins the growing list of Australians who have signed for MLC season 2 including teammates Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith and Jake Fraser Mcgurk.\n\nOther Aussies likely to join Cummins\n\nAustralia T20I captain Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis and others are also expected to join the list.\n\nIn the opening match of the MLC season 2, reigning champions MI New York will take on runners-up Seattle Orcas in Morrisville on July 6 while Texas Super Kings and LA Knight Riders will face each other in the second match of the day in Texas."

        "body": "Had the driver been one of the curious American-born spectators who ventured inside the venue and witnessed the USA's first ever T20 World Cup game -- a pulsating seven-wicket victory over Canada -- he would have had the answer.\n\nYes, team game it is, but in the shortest form it is also one that can be largely won by the brilliance of an individual.\n\nFor the USA's maiden victory, in front of a passionate crowd inside the purpose built, 7,000 capacity home of Major League Cricket, that individual was Aaron Jones.\n\nJones' unbeaten 94 of 40 balls, featuring 14 boundaries, ten of them sixes, with the stadium PA blasting out Miley Cyrus's \"Party in the USA\" after the biggest hits, transformed what could have been a very low key American debut in elite cricket into a spectacular celebration.\n\n\"Especially because America is not really a 'cricketing country'. I wanted to win the first game of the tournament for our fans and we did that,\" a smiling Jones said after the game.\n\nNow the USA must prepare for a much bigger test of their credentials in the sport's elite, when they take on Pakistan, at the same venue, on Thursday.\n\nConverting Americans?\n\nBut there is a bigger context to this tournament for the co-hosts because as much as organiser's play down the attempt to convert American sports fans to the pleasures of the old game, part of the whole idea of holding the biennial tournament in the USA is to establish some firmer roots for the sport here.\n\nThere were two things to note about the crowd at Grand Prairie -- as expected the majority of spectators were drawn from the Indian community in Texas but as they showed throughout, they are fervent backers of the national team of their adopted country.\n\nEvery one of New York born but Barbados-raised Jones' sixes was greeted with a massive roar and the final one, to seal victory, set off wild celebrations in the stands.\n\nThe second element was that, scattered among those Indian-heritage fans were local Americans who have, to a greater or lesser degree, been won over by the game.\n\nSean Fortner, who drove three hours from Houston with his family and friends, was attending his first ever match but said he had watched many games on television after studying Indian society and culture at University.\n\n\"I watched it for a long time, trying to figure it all out,\" he told AFP, \"Finally I got one of my Indian friends to explain all the rules to me and I just got hooked on it\".\n\nSo much so that Fortner even made a seven-minute video explainer that he shared with his companions before they made the trip to the game.\n\nAnother Texan first-time fan Ryan Ubl from Dallas, was also at his first game.\n\n\"I got into it really during the ODI World Cup in India. I worked with a bunch of people from India and they were very enthusiastic about it all and so I watched a bit of it and tickets weren't so expensive, so here I am,\" he said.\n\nUbl is a baseball fan and knows there are limits to how far cricket could go in the USA but thinks there is a future beyond this tournament.\n\n\"Obviously I don't think it'll ever eclipse baseball but it could carve out its own little niche,\" he said.\n\nFortner agrees even if he knows the sporting mainstream remains far away.\n\n\"Just watching how hard it has been for soccer to get a (foothold) when half the people that live here love soccer already, it's a hard hill to climb. But it can catch on, we know fandom and we get loyal,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not going to get a lot of fans but we'll get loyal fans,\" he said.\n\nJones, still buzzing from his spectacular innings was understandably in no mood for measured considerations even with Pakistan and top-ranked India to come.\n\nHis accent may be Bajan but the attitude and rhetoric was all-American.\n\n\"We want to play fearless cricket. We want to play hard cricket. We want to play smart cricket and I think we're going to go into the Pakistan game with the same mindset. We want to play fearless cricket regardless of who we play against,\" he said.\n\n© 2024 AFP"

        "date": "Mon Jun  3 06:52:56 2024",
        "body": "In a major signing, Australia’s Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins is set to feature in the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC). The 31-year-old will play for the San Francisco Unicorns, a franchise with a strategic partnership with Victoria's first-class setup in Australia. Cummins is expected to take on a leadership role with the Unicorns following Aaron Finch's retirement.\n\nThis MLC stint marks a significant move for Cummins into the T20 franchise world, especially after leading Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL 2024 final. The Australian skipper has also played in the Big Bash League. Cummins has been on the road with Australia and the Sunrisers since mid-February, and the three-week MLC stint, starting five days after the World Cup, will conclude a demanding cricket schedule that began with the tour of New Zealand in February.\n\nInterestingly, Cummins has previously shown little interest in the T20 franchise circuit. His decision to play in the MLC highlights the league's growing prominence in world cricket, attracting top-tier stars. Cummins will join fellow Australians Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith, and Jake Fraser-McGurk for the second season of MLC. It’s also understood that Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, and several other members of Australia’s World Cup squad are expected to participate.\n\nThe second season of MLC kicks off on July 5 with a doubleheader. Defending champions MI New York and Seattle Orcas will open the season in a rematch of last season's final in Morrisville, followed by a home game for Texas Super Kings against the LA Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in the Dallas Metro area.\n\nAlso Read: T20 World Cup 2024: India vs Pakistan clash ticket prices skyrocket, touch Rs 8.4 lakh; details here"

        "date": "Sun Jun  2 17:29:52 2024",
        "body": "Jones' 40-ball 94 was an eye-opener as his team notched a convincing seven-wicket victory over rivals Canada here, beginning the home team's campaign on a rousing note in a tournament they are hosting for the first time, along with the West Indies.\n\nJones, whose place in the T20I side was under scrutiny and was released by Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise Seattle Orcas after its inaugural edition, said he showed he was \"good enough\" to play at the highest level. He was not picked in the last MLC draft.\n\n\"When I wasn't selected in the Major League, I just took it as a stepping stone in the journey,\" he said.\n\n\"I would have loved to get drafted, so it goes sometimes. Hopefully tonight's innings will probably open the eyes of those who don't know me or USA cricket.\n\n\"We have great players here and that we have a lot of talent here and are willing to play at the highest level for sure.\"\n\nSet a target of 195, icc-t20-world-cup-with-our-batting-anything-under-200-was-chaseable-says-aaron-jones\">USA stuttered initially, losing opener Steven Taylor for zero in the second ball of the innings, and were 42/2 after 6.3 overs.\n\nBut Jones had other ideas as he came up with a counter-attacking innings to script a memorable win with as many as 14 balls to spare.\n\n\"I don't think it is easy to put it into words. We know Canada come hard against us since it is a big rivalry. Happy to take the team over the line,\" said Jones.\n\n\"Sometimes as a cricketer, you could go a bit under the radar if you have a few low scores,\" Jones said. \"I always back myself and know that I am capable of performing at every level. (I am) happy that I came out on top and won the game for USA.\n\n\"Hope it opens the eyes of some people around the world that I am good enough to play T20 cricket.\n\n\"I believe in myself, I work hard and I just use (criticism) as motivation. I know that I'm good enough to play at the highest level, and whenever given the opportunity, I'll do my best for sure.\n\n\"When I went out to bat tonight, I just saw it as another game to fight for me and bring my team as close as possible to the line, and if we get as close as possible to the line and over the line, it's great for the team.\"\n\nDespite losing two early wickets, Jones said he was confident of chasing down the total with their long batting lineup. He got a helping hand from Andries Gous, who made 65 off 46 balls in a 131-run partnership with Jones.\n\n\"With our batting line-up, knew anything under 200 is chaseable. Outfield and pitch were good and we knew that,\" said Jones after USA's highest run chase in T20Is.\"\n\nUSA will next take on Pakistan at the same venue on Thursday and play India in ten days' time, while Canada face Ireland in New York on Friday.\n\n\"We just want to keep winning as much as possible, of course we can't win every single game for the rest of our lives.\n\n\"I don't think our plan (for the rest of the tournament) is going to change much. We want to play fearless cricket, we want to play hard cricket, we want to play smart cricket.\n\n\"We are going into the Pakistan game with the same mindset. We want to play fearless cricket, regardless of who we play against.\"\n\nAll praise for Jones, USA skipper Monank Patel said: \"We've always known, he has the game. He played fearless cricket and backing his shots. It was clean hitting."

        "body": "Australia cricket team's Test and ODI cricket team captain Pat Cummins was seen captaining the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) team in the recently concluded IPL 2024 and the team had reached the final under the captaincy of Cummins.\n\nCummins Is Going To Be Seen Playing In The Second Season Of MLC\n\nOn the other hand, now the news is coming that Pat Cummins is going to be seen playing in the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC). Also, Cummins will not only play for San Francisco Unicorns but he will also be seen captaining the team.\n\nIt is worth noting that former AUS captain Aaron Finch, who led the San Francisco Unicorns in the first season, has retired from cricket. Because of this, the franchise has added experienced captain and bowler Pat Cummins.\n\nAlso Read: Most Runs In IPL 2024\n\nIt is worth noting that San Francisco shares an important strategic partnership with Cricket Victoria in the domestic circuit of Cricket Australia (CA). It will be interesting to see how Cummins is going to perform for the San Francisco franchise in the upcoming season?\n\nMLC Starts From July 5\n\nOn the other hand, if we give you information about the second season of Major League Cricket, then the upcoming season will be starting right after the T20 World Cup 2024 this time. On July 5, a doubleheader match will be seen on the very first day of the tournament and the first match is going to be played between defending champions Seattle Orcas in Mooresville and MI New York.\n\nIt is worth noting that recently the apex cricket body of the International Cricket Council (ICC) has granted List A cricket status to Major League Cricket and after this decision taken by the biggest cricket body, now more cricketers are expected to take part in this tournament."

Coming in at 42 for 2, Jones' knock helped USA chase 195, securing a seven-wicket win with 14 balls to spare. Jones, who faced scrutiny over his T20I place and missed out on the Major League Cricket draft, sees this performance as validation of his talent.\n\nJones highlighted the need to stay positive and aggressive, particularly during his 131-run partnership with Andries Gous, which shifted momentum towards USA. Reflecting on the innings, Jones considers it one of his best, significant not only for personal achievement but also for showcasing USA cricket on a global stage. Looking ahead, he emphasized maintaining a fearless and smart approach against upcoming opponents Pakistan and India."

        "body": "The second edition of Major League Cricket set to be played from the 5th of July till the 28th is set to be a blockbuster affair. Australian Test and ODI skipper Pat Cummins has signed for the San Francisco Unicorns for the upcoming season.\n\nIn the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket in 2023, San Francisco Unicorns finished 5th in the table just above LA Knight Riders with 4 points from five matches. Pat Cummins will have a few more Australians for the company in the form of Matthew Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Josh Inglis and young Brody Couch.\n\nThis year the likes of Steve Smith, Travis Head, Nathan Ellis, Lance Morris, Glenn Maxwell, and Andrew Tye will be some of the other Aussies taking part in the tournament. MI New York are the current champion having the first season in a one-sided final.\n\nAustralian stars face travel hassles\n\nThe Australian is in West Indies for the T20 World Cup but most of their stars had to face a few issues. In a report published by the official website of the Australian Cricket Board, Pat Cummins was in transit for more than 48 hours. It is also learnt that the 31-year-old has lost his baggage while coming to the Caribbean.\n\nAustralian spinner Ashton Agar while addressing the media said “A lot of the boys are coming off a long time in India in the IPL, maybe 48 hours at home for a couple of them, so to do something like that is so refreshing”. Pat Cummins and the rest of the Australian stars are scheduled to start their practice for the tournament soon.\n\nAgar also added that “I think mentally once you’ve done that, you go into the sessions ready to go because you’ve already enjoyed what the Caribbean has to offer. We were sitting on the roof of the catamaran as we were coming back last night and ‘Stoin’ (Stoinis) actually mentioned that, ‘I don’t know if many other teams would be like this”\n\nEnding his chat with the media the left-arm spinner said “Getting them hitting to the side the wind is not going to is important. There’s been a lot of weather around so I imagine it will be windy every day here in Barbados. The good thing is we won’t be surprised,”"

His consistent wicket-taking ability earned him a spot in Pakistan’s national T20 World Cup squad.\n\nhttps://x.com/SFOUnicorns/status/1796590131807449517?t=OUrXFwtIP8YV3m9JpVaOBw&s=19\n\nIn addition to his international impact as a spinner, Abrar showcased his skills in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), representing the Quetta Gladiators. He notched up 16 wickets in 10 innings, solidifying his reputation as a reliable spinner in the T20 format as he finished as the third-highest wicket-taker in the tournament.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns, one of the eight franchises in MCL, recognized Abrar’s potential and moved quickly to secure his services. As the MCL prepares for its second season, the addition of a player of Abrar’s caliber is a significant boost for the USA-based franchise.\n\nWith the second edition of the MCL season kicking off in mid-July 2024, Pakistani cricket fans around the world can look forward to seeing Abrar in action for the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nCheck out the latest updates regarding T20 World Cup 2024 here!"
