At 3/2, MINY were in a dire situation.\n\nShayan Jahangir (26) and Monank Patel (48) attempted to stabilize the innings with a 49-run partnership. However, the scoring rate was kept in check by disciplined bowling from TSK. Patel's patient knock of 48 off 41 balls included five boundaries and a six, but it was Rashid Khan who provided the much-needed acceleration. Rashid's blistering 55 off 30 balls, featuring four sixes and four boundaries, propelled MINY to a respectable total.\n\nDespite Rashid's heroics, TSK bowlers ensured that MINY couldn't run away with the game.

Cricket South Africa confirmed on Thursday that he was not passed fit to play the Test series, which begins on August 7.\n\nPretorius was last named in a South Africa squad in March 2021, for a T20I series against Pakistan, but he didn't get a cap. He also got a national call-up in December 2020 for a Test series in Sri Lanka, but then injured his shoulder and could not debut.\n\nIn 64 first-class games, Pretorius, 29, has 188 wickets at 27.50.

        "body": "oi-Avinash Sharma\n\nDallas, (TX), Jul 24: Led by Calvin Savage's stellar all-round performance, the Texas Super Kings handed the Seattle Orcas a comprehensive 37-run defeat in the final league match of the Major League Cricket 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, on Tuesday (July 23).\n\nDespite Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya giving the Orcas a solid start in their run chase, the Texas Super Kings' bowlers, led by Ottneil Bartmann (3/20), Noor Ahmad (2/19), and Calvin Savage (2/23), dismantled the Seattle batting lineup.\n\nWith the match's conclusion, Seattle Orcas finished their campaign with six losses and a sole victory, whereas the Texas Super Kings, who secured three wins and two losses (two no results), will play MI New York in the eliminator.\n\nSeattle Orcas' Run Chase Falters\n\nMirroring the first innings, the Seattle Orcas' run chase lost Ryan Rickleton (0) off the first ball of the innings to Ottneil Bartmann. Shehan Jayasuriya (24) joined Quinton de Kock (26), and the pair took control of the run chase. At the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 47/1.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya eventually fell to Calvin Savage in the seventh over after a 27-ball stint at the crease. Not long after, the dangerous Quinton de Kock was also dismissed, leaving the Orcas at 59/3 in the ninth over.\n\nFaced with a steep equation, the onus was on Heinrich Klaasen (4) and Matthew Bracewell (4) to steer the innings. However, both batters were outfoxed by spinners and dismissed for single digits. Mitchell Santner saw the back of Klaasen, while Bracewell was trapped lbw by Noor Ahmad.\n\nComing together with the score at 67/5 in 10.4 overs, Shubham Ranjane (16) and Keemo Paul (25) laboured to keep the Orcas in contention. However, Ranjane was run out and Keemo Paul was castled by Noor Ahmad before the 17th over, comprehensively extinguishing the run chase.\n\nAli Sheikh chipped in with a consolatory knock, but the Orcas fell well short, finishing at 140/9. Ottneil Bartmann took two wickets in the tail to finish with figures of 3/20.\n\nTexas Super Kings' Innings\n\nEarlier in the day, the Texas Super Kings lost opener Devon Conway (0) and Joshua Tromp (6) early in the innings. However, Faf Du Plessis (37) was in fine form, smashing six boundaries and a six before he was scalped by Keemo Paul. At the end of the power play, the Texas Super Kings were placed at 56/3.\n\nMilind Kumar (27) played a watchful knock, scoring nearly a run-a-ball before he became Keemo Paul's second wicket of the day. The experienced all-rounders, Marcus Stoinis (11) and Mitchell Santner (15), both got starts but failed to convert them into bigger scores, falling to Aryan Desai and Matthew Bracewell, respectively.\n\nCalvin Savage (45*) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson. The pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings. Stevenson (17) struck a four and six to support Savage's late innings fireworks, but was cleaned up by Nandre Burger in the 18th.\n\nSavage hammered Bracewell for two consecutive maximums in the 16th over and went on to script a 17-run over off Nandre Burger's 18th over to remain unbeaten and help the Texas Super Kings finish at 177/8.\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nTexas Super Kings 177/8 (Faf Du Plessis 39 off 17, Calvin Savage 45* off 27, Keemo Paul 2/18, Aryan Desai 2/30)\n\nSeattle Orcas 140/9 (Quinton de Kock 26 off 19, Keemo Paul 25 off 17, Ottneil Bartmann 3/20, Noor Ahmad 2/19)\n\nResult: Texas Super Kings won by 37 runs."

Washington are on a good run of form in the MLC. Who will win this game of cricket?\n\nReceive Your Welcome Bonus!\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns form\n\nCorey Anderson and his men have taken their positive energy flowing from the humbling of Washington Freedom last night. The underdogs took down the top team in the table so this must have served as a big boost coming into this action. He believes in his team making an interesting fight banked on Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk to be an explosive opening pair. High expectations rest on Sanjay Krishnamurthi, who played a match-winning knock in the last game. Josh Inglis and Matthew Short are the other two middle-order batsmen. Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan will be important as they come in to add runs during the later moments. The bowling will be under scrutiny, with bowlers like Brody Couch and Hassan Khan expected to do the job. Liam Plunkett and Haris Rauf will be experienced enough to shine during the middle overs. While both Anderson and Tajinder Dhillon are expecting to play effective supporting roles.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Predicted Lineup\n\nCorey Anderson, Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short, Josh Inglis, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Hassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Tajinder Dhillon\n\nWashington Freedom form\n\nIn their most recent league match, the Washington Freedom took a dent as they lost the contest against the San Francisco Unicorns by a margin of 6 wickets. The loss was the first for Steven Smith's side in what was turning out to be a fine season till now. They have been fantastic in most of the matches and, primarily, the batsmen have put the opposition teams' bowling attacks under a lot of pressure. The Unicorns are a team that Steven Smith and his side would want to face in their second encounter to return to winning ways.\n\nThe consistency of Travis Head and Steven Smith at the top order has been quite crucial. This pair will, therefore, be relied upon to provide a solid start in the forthcoming match. Andries Gous has been solid at No. 3 and will look to stitch partnerships with Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell in the middle order. The lower middle order comprising Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, and Marco Jansen will be expected to contribute quick runs.\n\nThe bowling has been good as a unit throughout the season, and it would want Marco Jansen and Jasdeep Singh to provide it a good start. Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar have to bowl good tight spells in the middle overs. Also, Maxwell and Ravindra can support the team in bowling.\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted Lineup\n\nSteven Smith (c), Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, Andries Gous (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Saurabh Netravalkar, Lockie Ferguson, Jasdeep Singh\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns vs Washington Freedom Expert Tips & Prediction\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have a good record of batting but their attack of them in bowling is not that strong, so it's going to be hard for the bowlers against the hitters in the team of Washington Freedom. Washington Freedom has the best number of top orders with a good run in the form, adding to the balanced bowling attack, surely the game is going to be of favor in the pocket of them. So, Washington Freedom will bag the honours over here."

        "body": "Afghanistan’s star all-rounder, Rashid Khan, illuminated the crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium with a scintillating half-century for MI New York in their Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 Eliminator clash against the Texas Super Kings.\n\nRashid, batting higher in the order than usual, unleashed a barrage of powerful strokes during his 30-ball innings, amassing 55 runs. His explosive performance included a standout moment with an innovative shot that featured prominently in the highlights of the New York innings, which concluded at 163/8 in their 20 overs.\n\nRashid Khan’s unique stroke play\n\nRashid is well-known for his ability to replicate MS Dhoni’s signature ‘helicopter’ shot, a swift aerial flick from near the off-stump to the on-side, often resulting in a six. However during the match, Rashid introduced a unique shot of himself.\n\nFacing a delivery from pacer Aaron Hardie, Rashid innovatively adjusted his approach. On the last ball of the 17th over, with a delivery marginally short and outside off-stump, Rashid sat deep in his crease and, with a powerful whip of his bat, sent the ball soaring over wide long-on for a spectacular six.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso READ: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024: Broadcast, live streaming details – When and Where to watch in India, US, UK, Australia & other countries\n\nMI New York’s challenging start\n\nNew York’s innings got off to a rocky start after being asked to bat first by TSK. They lost opener Dewald Brevis for a duck and Nicholas Pooran for 8, both wickets falling inside the first four overs, leaving the team at a precarious 18 for 2.\n\nShayan Jahangir and Monank Patel then steadied the innings with a 39-run partnership before Dwayne Bravo disrupted it by dismissing Jahangir for 26 off 23 balls. Rashid then joined Patel, and although the duo added a promising 35 runs, Patel was dismissed by spinner Noor Ahmad for a well-made 48 off 41 balls.\n\nRashid’s impactful innings\n\nDespite the interruptions, Rashid’s innings proved crucial. He counter-attacked with flair, hitting Bravo and Noor for boundaries, and scored two consecutive sixes off Hardie. His aggressive batting helped elevate the score to a competitive 163, though Romario Shepherd and New York’s captain, Kieron Pollard, contributed modestly. Rashid’s innings, characterized by 4 fours and 4 sixes, came at an impressive strike rate of 183.33. It marked the fourth time he has scored a fifty in T20 cricket.\n\nVictory for the Texas Super Kings\n\nIn the second innings, despite a brief rain delay complicating conditions, Rashid delivered a disciplined spell of bowling. He was introduced in the fourth over and conceded only four runs. Over his four-over spell, he maintained tight control, giving away just 22 runs.\n\nNevertheless, despite Rashid’s efforts, the Texas Kings chased down the target with ease. The leading run-scorer of the tournament, Faf du Plessis, continued his exceptional form, scoring another fifty and guiding TSK to a nine-wicket victory, thus winning the crucial Eliminator game."

        "body": "South African cricket has received a setback with the news that promising fast bowler Gerald Coetzee will miss the upcoming two-Test series against the West Indies. The pacer has been ruled out due to a side strain, an injury sustained during his stint with the Texas Super Kings in Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024.\n\nCoetzee had been making significant strides in his Test career and his absence will undoubtedly be felt by the Proteas. The young pacer’s ability to generate pace and bounce made him a valuable asset to the team, and his unavailability is a significant blow to South Africa’s bowling attack.\n\nReplacement announced\n\nIn a bid to bolster their pace bowling options, South Africa have called up Migael Pretorius, uncapped at Test level, as Coetzee’s replacement. The bowling all-rounder brings a wealth of first class cricket experience and versatility to the side, capable of contributing both with the bat and the ball.\n\nPretorius’ inclusion adds depth to the Proteas squad and provides a viable option for the team management. While he may not be a like-for-like replacement for Coetzee, his ability to contribute in multiple facets of the game makes him a valuable asset.\n\nAlso READ: South African coach Rob Walter opens up on Quinton de Kock’s T20I future\n\nImpact on the series\n\nCoetzee’s absence is a significant setback for South Africa, especially considering the challenging conditions that await them in the West Indies. The Caribbean pitches are known to offer assistance to fast bowlers, and Coetzee’s ability to extract bounce would have been crucial.\n\nThe Proteas will now have to rely on their remaining pace bowlers to shoulder the burden. Kagiso Rabada, and Lungi Ngidi will be expected to lead the attack, with Pretorius providing support.\n\nTemba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Matthew Breetzke, Nandre Burger, Tony de Zorzi, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Dane Paterson, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Tristan Stubbs, Ryan Rickelton, Kyle Verreynne, Migael Pretorius."

        "date": "Thu Jul 25 04:57:40 2024",
        "body": "The cricket system in the USA, similar to in different parts of the world, isn’t always without its flaws. Although it represents a vast emerging marketplace for the game, its early years were marred by controversies. Despite these challenges, one positive development has been the establishment of Major League Cricket (MLC), a premier T20 competition.\n\nMLC has created a platform for players from diverse countries and backgrounds to interact with some of the sport’s biggest names. This league provides an indirect pathway for Indian cricketers, who are unable to play outside of India, to showcase their talents if they relocate to the USA for various reasons.\n\nAs MLC 2024 approaches the qualifiers, three Indian-born players are particularly keen to make their mark. Let’s take a closer look at their stories:\n\n1. Milind Kumar – Texas Super Kings\n\nRight-handed batsman Milind Kumar was once quite a celebrity in Indian domestic cricket. He began his career in the Ranji Trophy with his hometown Delhi before moving to Sikkim for the 2018-19 season, where he emerged as the highest run-scorer with 1331 runs beating the top players as the faces of Wasim Jaffer and Rinku Singh .\n\nKumar had brief spells in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) and Royal Challengers Bangalore. However, limited opportunities led him to move to the USA around 2021, where he initially played in Minor League Cricket. His impressive performances there earned him a spot in the Texas Super Kings (TSK) for the inaugural MLC season. Kumar has since secured his place in the team, regularly batting at number five under the leadership of Faf du Plessis.\n\nThis season, Kumar contributed to TSK’s third-place finish in the league stage. His early matches included a couple of unbeaten innings, though he didn’t have much to bat in those games. He later scored two runs each in two consecutive matches before making a decent 29 (28) against the Seattle Orcas just before the playoffs.\n\n2. Monank Patel – MI New York\n\nMonank Patel is a well-known figure as the captain of the USA national team, which he led commendably during the recent 2024 T20 World Cup, including scoring a half-century against Pakistan. Born in Anand, Gujarat, Patel moved to the USA permanently in 2016 to open a restaurant in New Jersey, having earned his green card in 2010.\n\nAlthough Patel played only age-group cricket in Gujarat, his cricketing development primarily occurred in the USA, leading to his international debut in 2018. As a keeper-batsman, he has struggled to replicate his international form in MLC.\n\nLast season, he managed just 63 runs, and in the current edition, apart from a notable 61-run inning against TSK in a losing effort, he has not surpassed eight runs in six other games. However, his potential to shine in critical matches might still come through as MLC progresses.\n\n3. Saurabh Netravalkar – Washington Freedom\n\nThe journey of Saurabh Netravalkar is one of the most famous stories in Indian cricket teams. Born in Mumbai in 1991, the leading wicket-taker in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup is a promising left-arm spinner. Netrawalkar moved to the US. in 2015 to pursue a career in software engineering but continued his passion for cricket, which ultimately led to his international debut for the US\n\nIn MLC 2024, Netra Valkar has confirmed her growing popularity. Despite missing two matches due to the birth of a child, he picked up 12 wickets in five games, making him the top wicket-taker in the tournament and his performances, especially in the powerplay, have been significant in the Washington Freedom victory, helping them gain the top spot in the league table.\n\nAlthough he went wicketless against the San Francisco Unicorns in a recent match, he is expected to bounce back strongly in the upcoming qualifier against the same team. These three players highlight the opportunities MLC provides for cricketers with diverse backgrounds and journeys, fostering a unique cricketing ecosystem in the USA."

        "body": "Washington Freedom will aim to be the first team to enter the final of the Major League Cricket 2024 season when we meet the San Francisco Unicorns in the Qualifier at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday.\n\nOur Qualifier match against SFU on July 25 is scheduled to start at 7:30 PM CT (July 26, 6:00 AM IST). The MLC 2024 game will be available to watch via live streaming and broadcast.\n\nThe top two teams in the MLC 2024 points table will meet in the Qualifier and the winning team will directly proceed to the final. The losing side will have one more shot at redemption when they meet the winners of the Eliminator contest, a match between the third and fourth-placed teams.\n\nWe lost to SFU by six wickets (DLS method) in our last league game in Dallas on Monday, the first defeat of our MLC campaign this year.\n\nHowever, we finished on top of the MLC 2024 points table with 11 points from seven games, ahead of SFU on net run rate.\n\nTravis Head and skipper Steve Smith shone at the top of the order with half-centuries while Andrew Tye picked up three wickets, albeit in a losing cause, in a rain-shortened encounter.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar is on top of the bowling charts in MLC 2024 with 12 wickets from just five matches at an average of 12.16 runs and an astonishing strike rate of 9.16.\n\nMeanwhile, Head and Smith have moved to second and third in the overall batters’ list. Head has 250 runs from seven matches at an average of 41.66 and an excellent strike rate of 173.61 whereas Smith has accumulated 247 runs at an unbelievable average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 144.44.\n\nWF vs SFU form in MLC\n\nWe have won four of our last five league games in the MLC 2024 season with the six-wicket loss to San Francisco Unicorns on Monday being the only defeat this year. We have met SFU twice in the history of MLC with both teams winning a match apiece.\n\nWashington Freedom's last five matches\n\nOpponent\n\nVenue\n\nResult\n\nMatch Date\n\nMargin\n\nSFU\n\nDallas\n\nLost\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\n6 wickets (DLS)\n\nTSK\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 19, 2024\n\n42 runs\n\nMINY\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\n94 runs\n\nLAKR\n\nMorrisville\n\nWon\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\n8 wickets\n\nSO\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\n5 wickets\n\nWF vs SFU, Qualifier MLC 2024: Players to watch out\n\nHead, Smith and Tye were the positives that shone brightly in our loss to the San Francisco Unicorns in the last match. For a change, Smith outscored his left-handed opening partner during the powerplay.\n\nOur skipper smashed three sixes and five fours as he raced to 44 off just 22 balls to power us to 70/0 after the first six overs. Meanwhile, Head shifted gears, once Smith departed, to complete his fourth straight fifty in MLC.\n\nBoth Smith and Head were involved in a record partnership adding 101 runs, our highest for any wicket in the MLC, for the opening wicket against SFU. The duo have scored a total of 497 runs out of our total 936 runs this season, a whopping 53%, at a fast clip as well. Another flying start on Thursday and we will have one leg in the final.\n\nTye, playing his first game of the season, picked up three wickets against SFU in our last match. Though Tye was a bit expensive, he dismissed big-hitters Jake Fraser-McGurk, Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford, the last two in the same over, to keep us in the game right through the defense.\n\nMeanwhile, Netravalkar will be our trump card once again with his best spell in the MLC coming against the same opponent last year. His astonishing figures of 6/9 against SFU in 2023 helped us win a low-scoring game by a comfortable 30-run margin.\n\nWashington Freedom squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs SFU Qualifier MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nLIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns match will be available on Monumental Sports Network and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA. The match will start at 7:30 PM CT on July 25.\n\nThe WF vs SFU match will be streamed LIVE on the Jio Cinema App and website in India starting at 06:00 AM IST on July 26."

        "body": "The Major League Cricket saw a scary moment take place, as fast-bowler Carmi le Roux was hit on the head by a hard shot from batsman Ryan Rickleton. San Francisco Unicorns bowler le Roux was bowling his second over when Seattle Orcas batter Rickleton’s shot caught him by surprise and slammed onto his head. The nasty blow left le Roux’s face completely bloodied. Thankfully, le Roux was still in his senses despite the hit, and walked off without any help from his teammates.\n\nBowling the third over of the game, South African Le Roux was smashed on the head by a shot from compatriot Rickleton. Rickleton, a left-hander, had looked to hit it straight, but the shot ended up going straight at the bowler.\n\nWatch: Scary moment in MLC as Carmi le Roux gets hit on the head\n\nMedical staff were rushed on to the ground, but to everyone’s relief, le Roux was able to walk off on his own.\n\nSeattle Orcas at the bottom\n\nAfter le Roux was taken off, former New Zealand and current USA all-rounder Corey Anderson completed the over. Defending 165, the San Francisco Unicorns were able to restrict Seattle Orcas to just 142, despite missing le Roux.\n\nFormer England pacer Liam Plunkett, 39, was the pick of the bowlers, ending the game with figures of 3/26 in four overs.\n\nAfter that game, the Seattle Orcas suffered another defeat two days later, this time to the Los Angeles Knight Riders. This left the Orcas at the bottom of the Major League Cricket (MLC) season two table. Their fortunes this season are a stark contrast to the previous season, when they had topped the table.\n\nThe Orcas are currently on just one victory in five games. Defending champions MI New York are also in trouble, sitting fifth and outside the playoff spots.\n\nThe tournament started on July 5, 2024, and the final is set to be played on July 28."
