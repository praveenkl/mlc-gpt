Jake Fraser-McGurk (3) was dismissed early in the third over and Marco Jansen struck a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen (13), who scored a century in the qualifier. With the score at 30/3, the Unicorns were in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued as Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) fell early, extinguishing any hopes of a miraculous chase.

Rachin Ravindra then cleaned out the tail with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the ultimate match of the tournament, the team from Washington Freedom lost Head (9) early. Then, Steve Smith (88) took centre stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock. He found support in Andries Gous (21), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, finding the boundary with ease.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40) joined Smith and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting.

The win came by seven wickets, the Freedom bowling out San Francisco for 145, before chasing that target down in just 15.3 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: WLW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: CAN SUPER KINGS SECURE A MUCH-CRAVED HOME FINAL\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns may have been put in their place by Washington in a qualifier, but showed huge guts and class to bounce back in the challenger, breaking the hearts of home team Texas Super Kings. The Unicorns made 200/6 in a high-scoring thriller, which they ultimately won by 10 runs, restricting Texas to 190/4.\n\nLAST THREE: WLW\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe two Washington Freedom openers being the second and third highest scoring batters in the tournament is testament to the strength of their top order. Travis Head’s 77 not out in the qualifier took his overall tally to 327, whilst opening partner Steve Smith boasts 248 runs of his own. The smart move would be placing a stake on both via the ‘Team - Top Batter’ and also backing the pair to each record over 30+ match runs.\n\nSo often a left-arm pacer can prove worth their weight in gold across the T20 format and Marco Jansen demonstrated that last time out, taking three wickets against San Francisco. Jansen’s height poses an additional threat in regards to generation extra bounce and making a play for the South African to pick up over 1.5 match wickets looks good value.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nOnce again, Finn Allen was the star for San Francisco Uniforms in the challenger having accumulated one of his best individual innings in T20 cricket. It was his 101 off 53 balls which ensured an eventual winning total for the Unicorns vs Texas. He will have a huge role to play in the final and on the back of such a brilliant score, is worth backing to accrue over 24.5 match runs here. His six-hitting abilities could also warrant investment, specifically via the ‘Batter Total Match Sixes’ market.\n\nOn the bowling front, Hassan Khan has taken three wickets across the play-offs so far and his left-arm orthodox slow bowling has been tricky to deal with from an opposition point of view. You’d expect Hassan to bowl his four-over allocation in the final and a stake on him to pick up 2+ wickets via the ‘Bowler Milestones’ market is worth serious consideration.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERTPREDICTION\n\nThe last time these two teams met, Washington Freedom demonstrated their class in all departments. Outplaying San Francisco with bat and ball, the Freedom have shown why they’ve set the standard throughout this year’s edition of Major League Cricket. Having a world class top order that combines control with aggression has been key to their success, whilst all avenues are well-covered within the bowling department.\n\nPlenty depends on Finn Allen from a San Francisco point of view, but if he was to fail then you would worry about the Unicorns’ depth, particularly if Washington was to take a cluster of early wickets. With just one defeat across the tournament so far, in a game that had precious little at stake from their point of view, Washington Freedom have been outstanding and the expectation is that they will take that final step and emerge triumphant in the second year of Major League Cricket."

The start was terrible as they lost both Jake Fraser McGurk and Finn Allen cheaply. Post their dismissals, Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford also failed and San Francisco Unicorns looked in tatters. Hassan Khan played a nice innings of 57 runs in 36 balls to help San Francisco Unicorns get past the 140 run mark.\n\nDuring the chase, Washington Freedom lost Steven Smith, Rachin Ravindra and Andries Gous cheaply.

Captain Smith stood at one end and got great support from Andries Gous, Rachin and Glenn Maxwell, bringing their side into the game.\n\nMaxwell & Smith’s aggressive 83-run partnership between over 11-17 pushed Washington’s potential total from 180 to 200+. Maxwell’s 40 of 22 and final over fireworks from Mukhtar Ahmed and Obus Pienaar resulted in Washington Freedom posting a huge total of 207/5 at the end of 20 overs. Pat Cummins was the pick of the bowlers for San Francisco as he finished with 2/35, while Hassan Khan, Haris Rauf and Juanoy Drysdale picked up a wicket apiece.\n\nChasing 208, the San Francisco Unicorns lost their youthful top order in the first five overs as Marco Jansen sent back both openers in Jake Fraser-McGurk and Finn Allen early.

Jansen and Rachin picked up three wickets each with Tye taking two and Maxwell and Netravalkar sharing one wicket each.\n\nWith complete domination in batting, bowling and fielding, Washington Freedom led by Smith and coached by Ricky Ponting won the second edition of Major League Cricket.\n\nFinal: Washington Freedom beat San Francisco Unicorns by 96 runs\n\nTop performers of MLC 2024\n\nHits of MLC 2024\n\nTravis Head (Washington Freedom)\n\nTravis Head had an outstanding MLC 2024. Making his debut in MLC, Head came in with a huge reputation for being a destructive opener after his heroics in IPL 2024 and ICC T20WC 2024. He lived up to the hype as the South Australian smashed 336 runs at a massive strike rate of 174. He smashed five consecutive fifties and outplayed the oppositions almost single handedly. Apart from winning the championship, he was awarded the “Player of the Tournament” award for his match-winning knocks.\n\nSteven Smith (Washington Freedom)\n\nSteven Smith redeemed himself in T20 cricket through a championship-winning season for Washington Freedom. He stepped up as both batter and captain as he led his team to the title, winning seven of the nine games. With the bat, he proved his mettle as an opener. He smashed 336 runs at an average of 56 with a strike rate of 149, smashing three fifties, with the most important one coming in the final.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom)\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar had an excellent season. He was the highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets in seven innings at an outstanding strike rate of 10.5. The experience of playing the big teams in ICC T20WC 2024 helped Netravalkar become an even better bowler in MLC 2024.\n\nRashid Khan (MI New York)\n\nRashid Khan was one of the few positives for the relatively below-par season for inaugural champions MI New York. He showcased his all-round capabilities as he picked up 10 wickets, maintaining a good economy of 6.2. He stepped up the bat, too, scoring 162 runs in seven innings with two fifties. His strike rate of 178 with the bat was the third-best for a batter in MLC 2024.\n\nMisses of MLC 2024\n\nSunil Narine (LA Knight Riders)\n\nSunil Narine had a horror season with both bat and ball. With the bat, he scored just 27 runs in six innings at an average of just 4.5, which is the lowest for a batter this season. He did not even reach a double-digit score in any of the six games. As a bowler, he managed just five wickets in six innings, even though he put the batters under pressure with an economy of 6.2. His failure with bat and ball impacted his captaincy as the LA Knight Riders failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nKieron Pollard (MI New York)\n\nKieron Pollard, too, was another captain who was a burden on his own team during MLC 2024. Leading MI New York, the big West Indian managed just 64 runs in seven innings. He averaged 12.6 and scored at a strike rate of 98, which was un-Pollard-like. He picked up five wickets in seven games as the occasional bowler. His overall performance did not live up to a captain’s standards.\n\nJake Fraser McGurk (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe Victorian sensation Jake Fraser McGurk had an MLC to forget as he was one of the least impactful players for the eventual runners-up, San Francisco Unicorns. In seven innings, he managed just 81 runs at an average of 11.6. He had a below-par strike rate of 126 and failed to cross even 20 runs in the seven innings.\n\nHaris Rauf (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nHaris Rauf had a quiet MLC 2024, as he managed just four wickets in nine games. His economy was also on the higher side as he gave away runs at 9.1 runs/over. His bowling strike rate of 48.5 was the worst for a bowler in MLC 2024. He went wicketless in six of the nine games.\n\nBreakout performers in MLC 2024\n\nHassan Khan (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe 25-year-old all-rounder Hassan Khan had a breakout performance in MLC 2024. Representing San Francisco Unicorns, the attacking batter came at the lower order (6-8) and smashed 204 runs at an average of 40.8 with a strike rate of 144. With the ball, the left-arm spinner picked up 10 wickets in seven innings with an economy of 7.1 and a strike rate of 13.2. He was a standout performer for his team as he was their highest wicket-taker and second-highest run-scorer over Matt Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Josh Inglis and others.\n\nUnique Statistical Milestones\n\nAustralian players to score five consecutive fifties in a T20 tournament\n\nDavid Warner - IPL 2019\n\nTravis Head - MLC 2024\n\nHighest win% for an Australian Captain in T20Is (50+ matches)\n\n64.1 - Ashton Turner\n\n63.3 - Steven Smith\n\n62.2 - Adam Voges\n\n61.3 - Moises Henriques\n\n61.1 - Daniel Christian"

It’s a rematch of the Qualifier where Washington Freedom easily outclassed San Francisco Unicorns by 7 wickets. San Francisco Unicorns made full use of the additional opportunity they got in the Challenger and beat Texas Super Kings by 10 runs to reach their first-ever final.\n\nMatch Details:\n\nWashington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns, Final\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas\n\nDate & Time: July 29th at 6:00 AM IST and July 28th at 7:30 PM Local Time\n\nLive Streaming: Sony Sports Network and JioCinema\n\nWhat is the Pitch Report for WAS vs SF, Major League Cricket 2024, Final?\n\nThe surface has genuine bounce and carry where the batters can play the shots on the rise. It got better for batting during the Challenger between San Francisco Unicorns and Texas Super Kings where a total of 390 runs were scored. It’s not an easy venue to catch the ball during the night time and whoever fields well has more chances of winning the high-voltage clash.\n\nRecent form:\n\nWashington Freedom: Won, Lost, Won, Won, Won\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Won, Lost, Won, Won, Won\n\nWAS vs SF, Major League Cricket 2024, Final Probable Winners:\n\nWashington Freedom are expected to win this match.\n\nWhat is the Expected, Probable Playing XIs for WAS vs SF, Major League Cricket 2024, Final?\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nTravis Head, Steven Smith, Andries Gous (wk), Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson / Andrew Tye, Saurabh Netravalkar, Ian Holland\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen, Jake Fraser McGurk, Sanjay Krishnamurthy, Josh Inglis (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Hassan Khan, Corey Anderson (c), Pat Cummins, Haris Rauf, Carmi le Roux, Juanoy Drysdale\n\nInjury Updates:\n\nLockie Ferguson is doubtful for the final after suffering a hamstring injury in the Qualifier.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Cricket Top Picks, Players for WAS vs SF, Major League Cricket 2024, Final?\n\nTop Pick – Batter\n\nWords aren’t enough to describe, Travis Head’s current form at the moment as he became the first batter in the Major League Cricket to score 5 half-centuries on the trot. He is currently the second leading run-scorer in the tournament with 327 runs in 8 matches and needs another 94 runs to finish at the pole position.\n\nTop Pick – All-Rounder\n\nGlenn Maxwell recorded his first half-century of the tournament in the Qualifier against Unicorns where he struck an unbeaten 54* from just 23 balls. Overall, he made 113 runs and picked up 9 wickets.\n\nTop Pick – Bowler\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar has the uncanny knack of picking wickets and tops the leading wicket-takers chart in the tournament with 14 scalps in 6 matches he played.\n\nTop Pick – Wicketkeeper\n\nJosh Inglis looks in decent touch, having scores of 37, 8, 45, and 24* in his last 4 innings. He is likely to bat at No.4 for Unicorns.\n\nX-Factor:\n\nRachin Ravindra bowled exceedingly well in the Qualifier against Unicorns, returning with the figures of 4 for 11 in only 2.4 overs he bowled. In 6 matches in the tournament, he scored 88 runs and picked up 9 wickets.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Suggested Teams for WAS vs SF, Major League Cricket 2024, Final?\n\n1. Josh Inglis, Andries Gous, Travis Head (c), Finn Allen, Jake Fraser McGurk, Glenn Maxwell, Hassan Khan (vc), Rachin Ravindra, Marco Jansen, Pat Cummins, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\n2. Josh Inglis, Steven Smith, Travis Head, Finn Allen (c), Sherfane Rutherford, Sanjay Krishnamurthy, Glenn Maxwell (vc), Hassan Khan, Marco Jansen, Carmi le Roux, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nWashington Freedom drilled San Francisco Unicorns by 7 wickets in the Qualifier to reach the final for the first time. It took them only 15.3 overs to chase the modest 145, thanks to merciless hitting from Australia duo Travis Head (77*) and Glenn Maxwell (54*). Special credits to the bowlers who bowled in tandem, especially spinners Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell who rallied through the middle overs where the latter picked up 4 wickets while Marco Jansen who took the new cherry, claimed 3 scalps despite going 11.5 runs an over. They are a strong batting side with Travis Head firing at the top and with Glenn Maxwell back in form, they are hard to beat. The support from the bowlers is exceptional with Saurabh Netravalkar claiming 14 wickets, the most in the tournament. Lockie Ferguson walked off the field after tweaking his hamstring during the Qualifier contest and it’s a concern for the management if he doesn’t recover on time for the finals."

Smith's innings was a masterclass in controlled aggression, while Maxwell's explosive batting provided the necessary fireworks to propel the team to a formidable total.\n\nThe Unicorns, in response, were immediately put on the back foot. Jake Fraser-McGurk fell early, dismissed for just 3 runs in the third over. The situation worsened when Marco Jansen delivered a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen, who had been the hero in the qualifier with a century, for a mere 13 runs. With the scoreboard reading 30/3, the Unicorns found themselves in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued as Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) fell early, extinguishing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, who was brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, further tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then cleaned out the tail with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the ultimate match of the tournament, the team from Washington lost Head (9) early. Then, Steve Smith (88) took centre stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock. He found support in Andries Gous (21), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, finding the boundary with ease.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40) joined Smith and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as both Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith's departure, followed shortly by Maxwell's, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. The Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) beat San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs\n\nTOURNAMENT AWARDS:\n\nWINNERS: Washington Freedom\n\nRUNNERS-UP: San Francisco Unicorns\n\nSTAKE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Travis Head (Washington Freedom)\n\nROYAL RICE LEADING RUN SCORER: Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings)\n\nWILLOW BY CRICBUZZ LEADING WICKET TAKER: Saurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom)"

Under the leadership of Steve Smith, Washington Freedom won their maiden MLC title. Captain Smith was the man who saved the day for Washington with help of Australian compatriot Glenn Maxwell after they faced an early trouble in the first innings of the match.l\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns' captain, Corey Anderson, won the toss and chose to bowl first, putting WAF into bat.

He was well-supported by Glenn Maxwell, who added a brisk 40 off 22 balls. Thanks to their impactful performances, the Freedom set a formidable total of 207/5 in their 20 overs.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns relied on their opening pair, Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk, to chase down the massive target. However, the Freedom bowlers struck early and maintained pressure throughout the innings. Steve Smith used his bowlers strategically which led them to take wickets consistently , making the final a one-sided contest. In the end, the Unicorns were dismissed for just 111 runs in 16 overs, losing the MLC 2024 final by 96 runs.\n\nMarco Jansen and Rachin Ravindra excelled with the ball for the Freedom, each claiming three wickets.

Smith comlimented Washington team's inclusive atmosphere and how everyone chipped in with efforts when they were needed.\n\n\"Nice to contribute, been a really good season. We have a really good bunch, had plenty of good times off the field. We just talked about trusting the process, just playing the game and not getting overawed by the moment. Really pleased for the boys. Some guys don't get a game but they are surely part of the squad, and we try to make them feel included. Everyone in this group has been outstanding. Everyone stood up at different times, our batting was pretty strong and Marco maybe didn't get to bat throughout the tournament. On the batting front, Travis was spectacular and he rightly won Player of the Tournament. With our bowling, I thought Netravalkar was outstanding and Lockie who missed today due to injury was outstanding as well. Everyone stood up for us.\""

Smith and Australia team-mate Glenn Maxwell dominated with the bat then Unicorns' chase disintegrated with Marco Jansen claiming both openers among his three wickets.\n\nThe result cemented Freedom's standing as the team of the season having secured five wins in the group stage before progressing direct to the final with victory over Unicorns in the Qualifier. This contest turned their way through a stand of 83 off 39 balls between Smith and Maxwell as Freedom added 121 in the second half of their innings.\n\nSmith, who was overlooked for Australia's T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, overcame a sluggish start in the powerplay to make 88 off 52 balls including six sixes. Having been 10 off 12 balls in the sixth over he sped to a 34-ball fifty and ended the season as the joint second-leading run-scorer, alongside Travis Head, with 336 at a strike-rate of 148.67.\n\nHead, who has struck at over 170 during the tournament, fell early to Pat Cummins when he edged to slip, where Finn Allen held on at the second attempt, having been given a life in the opening over. But Andries Gous gave Freedom's innings impetus as Smith found his feet although when Haris Rauf removed Rachin Ravindra after the midway mark, it was an even contest at 86 for 3.\n\nThen Smith and Maxwell, the latter having found form in the closing stages of the tournament, took charge included 28 coming off the 13th over from Juanoy Drysdale. Smith produced an outrageous scoop for six off Rauf and was in sight of a century when he got a top edge off Cummins.\n\nIt appears likely that Smith's T20I career is over following his World Cup omission and absence from the squad to face Scotland and England in September as the selectors look to the future, but it has been a profitable few weeks for him in the US.\n\nThough Maxwell also fell in the next over, superbly caught by Josh Inglis, Freedom were still able to cross 200.\n\nUnicorns' chase never got off the ground. Jake Fraser-McGurk's low-key tournament ended when he edged into the stumps against Jansen to leave him with 81 runs at 11.57 then both Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Allen also fell inside the powerplay to leave a daunting task. Sherfane Rutherford was superbly caught at deep backward square by Ian Holland the ball after being dropped and the rest of the batting fell away amid a huge asking rate.\n\nFreedom's victory gave Ricky Ponting a title as coach a couple of weeks after leaving his role with Delhi Capitals.\n\nAndrew McGlashan is a deputy editor at ESPNcricinfo"

A pre-game rendition of Star Spangled Banner played on electric guitar was followed by a drone light show as the 'half-time' entertainment.\n\nCommentators donned cowboy hats in keeping with the Texas venue that hosted the T20 World Cup opener last month, while sixes struck into the 7,000-strong crowd were measured in feet.\n\nBut the myriad Australians involved – eight of the 22 finalists, head coaches Ricky Ponting (Washington) and Shane Watson (San Fransisco), as well as the bulk of their assistants – left their mark on the competition's pinnacle match contested by the Cricket Victoria-aligned Unicorns and the Cricket NSW-aligned Freedom.\n\nWashington captain Smith, who owns an apartment in New York City, carted six sixes as he shared in a 83-run onslaught with Glenn Maxwell. Their union lasted 38 deliveries and essentially decided the match.\n\n\"He's been absolutely brilliant,\" Ponting said of Smith. \"He's pretty much singlehandedly won that game with the bat.\n\n\"I spoke to him before the game this morning and said, 'Look, if you play well, you show your class, you can win this game by yourself'. He's been awesome - his on-field leadership has been great.\"\n\nCummins (2-35 from four overs) had dismissed Smith's opening partner Travis Head with the new ball, but was then curiously held back by captain Corey Anderson as Smith and Maxwell torched the Unicorns' less credentialled bowlers.\n\nMaxwell hit four sixes en route to a 22-ball 40 but not even he could keep up with his long-time national teammate. He applauded when Smith, left out of Australia's T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, scooped Haris Rauf for the most daring of his six sixes.\n\nBy the time Cummins returned to dismiss Smith with a faster bouncer, and wicketkeeper Josh Inglis then leapt to take a stunning one-hander to account for Maxwell the following over, the damage had been done.\n\nWashington's 5-207, the highest score of this MLC season, proved 96 too many for San Fransisco, skittled for 111 with Inglis' 18 surpassed only by tailender Carmi le Roux hitting 20 in junk time.\n\nIt was the culmination of an impressive season from the Smith and Ponting-led Washington side that lost just one match all season.\n\nTheir other opener, Head, was named tournament MVP after hitting five consecutive fifties leading into the final, finishing with 336 runs at a strike-rate of 173.\n\n\"Everyone stood up at different times,\" said Smith.\n\n\"Our batting was strong – I don't think Marco (Jansen, the South Africa allrounder) even got a bat throughout the tournament batting at number eight.\n\n\"Travis Head was outstanding, it was nice to bat up the other end from him. He makes things a lot easier for me.\"\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk's fizzling follow-up to his breakout Indian Premier League campaign was capped as the Unicorns opener was dismissed for three to become the first of three Powerplay victims to the Freedom's left-arm pace pair, Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nWisconsin-born, Melbourne-raised Ian Holland had given Fraser-McGurk a life first ball when he fumbled a catch at point, but made up for his error when he took a tremendous diving outfield grab off Sherfane Rutherford amid a strong finish to the tournament for Maxwell (1-14).\n\nAndrew Tye (2-12), a late inclusion after Kiwi speedster Lockie Ferguson missed due to injury, got revenge over Inglis check-driving him for six by bowling his Perth Scorchers teammate to all but confirm Washington's triumph.\n\nAustralia's influence on the competition is certain to stretch beyond this season; Victoria and NSW have made long-term commitments to their Unicorns and Freedom franchises, while Cummins holds a four-year deal with the Unicorns, opening the door for other leading Australian to potentially join him in signing multi-year deals."

We enjoyed covering every bit of it and we hope that you too relished our coverage. We will be back next year with more excitement from MLC. However, cricketing action doesn’t stop around the world and you can tune in to our coverage of The Hundred Women at 7.30 pm IST (2 pm GMT) followed by The Hundred Men at 11.05 pm IST (5.35 pm GMT). The Olympics in Paris will also be the highlight in the sporting world for a couple of weeks where a lot of sports will be on display. That is it from our side, goodbye cheers and take care!\n\nSteven Smith is up for a chat. He was also the Player of the Match for this game. He says that it was nice to contribute and that it has been a good season. Adds that it has been a good bunch of guys and they have enjoyed themselves off the field as well. Mentions that they talked about trusting the process and feels that the team did an exceptional job. Says that they try everyone to feel that they are a part of the squad and all players had each other's backs. Mentions that everyone stood up at different times of the tournament and credits the batters for being the strength of the team. Appreciated the bowlers as well to take on the pressure and perform well. He then moves on to collect the winning trophy.\n\nTravis Head is the Player of the Tournament for his consistent performance, scoring 336 runs for his team consisting of five half-centuries.. He says that he is looking forward to the few weeks off after this and he feels delighted to clinch the title. Adds that a few afternoon naps helps him chill before the game and then think of what to do when you arrive for training and see what the bowlers are bowling. Mentions that he is enjoying his life in USA and he has had a brilliant time even off the field playing Golf. Says that he and Smith complement each other and it felt nice to have a familiar face on the other end.\n\nThe Bart King Award for the best domestic player of the tournament goes to Hassan Khan for his all-round performance. He says that it has been a wonderful tournament and he is happy to contribute to the team's cause. Adds that he is fortunate for him to perform well with the bat and spend some time out in the middle. Says that the strength he has while batting is natural and mentions that the management trusted his batting and allowed him to bat higher up the order. Feels that having Pat Cummins in their dressing room was a valuable experience and he learned a lot from him.\n\nCorey Anderson, the captain of San Francisco Unicorns is up for a chat. He says they are extremely disappointed as they came here expecting to lift the trophy and failed to do so. Adds the Smith and Maxwell partnership took the game away from them and it is hard to stop those guys when they are on song and they failed to execute their plans. Mentions they came out confident while chasing this total but they lost wickets early and they faded very quickly in the pace and lost their way in the chase. Says he is proud of the side and the way the players have played throughout. Closes by saying that this competition is going from strength to strength and is on the way up as we see more and more International stars featuring here.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw a very strong batting performance from Washington Freedom. Steven Smith had to do the heavy lifting for a major part of the innings but when partnered with Glenn Maxwell, the runs came in from both ends and took them to a strong position. A sudden boost by Mukhtar Ahmed at the end powered them past 200. In the bowling department, it was Pat Cummins with his two wickets who shone out. Carmi le Roux had an off day and went wicketless while the others got one each.\n\nAndries Gous says it has been awesome and all players dream of lifting such a trophy. Mentions that this is such an amazing feeling to be crowned as champions. Thanks the fans for their support and the number in which they have come out to support them. Closes by saying that everybody wants to come to the USA and such a quality tournament will help their cause.\n\nRachin Ravindra from Washington Freedom is up for a short chat as well. He says he loved to play with so many international stars and the way the Aussie core planned and executed the skills shows why they are a champion side. Mentions that the boys had done the job early with both bat and ball and all he needed to do was pick up the last few at the end.\n\nRicky Ponting, the coach of Washington Freedom is up for a chat and says he arrived a bit late and left the training to the staff. Says that the backroom support was just tremendous. Mentions that Smith pretty much won the game single-handedly with the way he played and he executed what we had planned which was to play the natural way and not let the occasion get big on anyone. Mentions that the condition they have had has been fantastic and the way the sides have performed throughout the season has been brilliant as well.\n\nWe have some interviews lined up. Starting with Saurabh Netravalkar who says that he is grateful for this platform and sharing the dressing room with such stars is a nice feeling. Mentions that this could well be the backbone of domestic cricket for the USA and the crowd coming in is a good sign of things to come. Andrew Tye joins him and agrees with Netravalkar. He adds that it is a nice feeling to work with the unit and they learn a lot by picking their brains.\n\nWashington Freedom started off extremely well with the early wicket of Marco Jansen. Saurabh Netravalkar soon followed up in his second over. Jansen got rid of the dangerous Finn Allen as well to put his team in a strong spot. Glenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, and Andrew Tye worked in tandem to take 4 wickets in 3 overs. Jansen got rid of Hassan Khan and that left them with the bowlers to deal with. Rachin Ravindra did the cleaning up towards the end and sealed a win for them. Ravindra was the pick of the bowlers for his spell of 4-0-23-3 along with Marco Jansen with his spell of 4-1-28-3. Andrew Tye clinched two while Glenn Maxwell and Saurabh Netravalkar, who is the leading wicket-taker in this series ended his season with one to his name.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns had a shaky start. They didn’t look comfortable and Jake Fraser-McGurk succumbed first. Sanjay Krishnamurthy and Finn Allen couldn’t stitch a partnership and got sent back in a span of one over. Sherfane Rutherford, Josh Inglis, and Corey Anderson too couldn’t make any significant impact and played rash shots to throw their wicket away. Those three could only get 23 runs on the board. The Unicorns slipped from being 30/1 in 3.4 overs to 53/6 in 8.3 overs. That period was the one where the game slipped out completely from their hands. Cummins came in and played some lusty blows along with Hassan Khan but the curtains were already drawn for their side. It was then onto the bowlers who tried to free their arms before being cleaned up for 111 in 16 overs.\n\nW\n\nOvers15.6\n\nScore111 - 10\n\nRachin Ravindra to Juanoy Drysdale, OUT! CASTLED! That was the final nail in the coffin for San Francisco Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra seals things off and Drysdale departs. Looped full, turning away. Juanoy Drysdale misses his drive yet again and the ball turns away from his blade to crash into the off pole. He has been very handy with the ball for Washington Freedom and has always been the go-to bowler for Steven Smith throughout the tournament.\n\nW\n\nOvers13.5\n\nScore92 - 9\n\nRachin Ravindra to Haris Rauf, OUT! Goes down the track, misses and the keeper does the rest. Tossed up outside off, Haris Rauf dances down the track and looks to slog this but misses out completely. The ball is gathered by the keeper and Gous removes the bails with Rauf still wandering outside his crease."

Their combination of star power, balanced squad, and clinical execution proved to be too much for their opponents.\n\nThe Washington Freedom cruised to a comprehensive 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in the tournament.

Drysdale, aiming for a yorker to unsettle the well-set Smith, lost control of the delivery.\n\nThe ball rocketed towards Smith, who had shuffled across the crease in anticipation. Fortunately, Smith escaped serious injury as Josh Inglis, the wicketkeeper, could only manage a partial save.\n\nThe delivery, rightfully called a no-ball, served as a stark reminder of the dangers associated with beamers in cricket.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nWashington Freedom batting: A masterclass by Smith\n\nWashington Freedom set the tone for a convincing victory with a strong batting performance. The lynchpin of their innings was the ever-reliable Australian batter, who anchored the innings with a magnificent 88 runs. Smith’s knock was a display of class and composure, and he played a pivotal role in guiding his team to a formidable total.\n\nValuable contributions came from Glenn Maxwell, who chipped in with a brisk 40 runs. The rest of the Washington Freedom batting lineup played their part, ensuring a strong foundation for their bowlers to defend.\n\nAlso WATCH: Corey Anderson’s remarkable catch to dismiss Faf Du Plessis in MLC 2024\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns crumble under pressure\n\nChasing a mammoth target of 208 runs, the San Francisco Unicorns batting lineup faltered under the pressure.

With a confident and controlled bat swing, Santner executed a powerful shot that effortlessly cleared the boundary over the long-off and sailed into the stands. The shot showcased Santner’s batting prowess and demonstrated his ability to capitalize on scoring opportunities with precision and confidence.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Kieron Pollard’s heartfelt gesture after accidentally hitting a fan with his six in MLC 2024\n\nCommanding victory for Texas Super Kings\n\nSantner’s innings ended abruptly when Michael Bracewell outfoxed him in the subsequent over. Even after the fall of Santner, TSK were eventually successful in posting a fighting score with Calvin Savage played a blistering unbeaten knock of 45 off 27 balls which included 6 fours and 2 sixes helped the team to reach the total of 177/8 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nIn response Orcas lost their first wicket early with Ryan Rickelton gone for a duck. Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya tried to provide the stability to the team by adding 52 runs for the second wicket but soon they both got dismissed and middle order faltered after that. Keemo Paul tried to provide some resistence with the quick knock of 25 off 17 balls but failed to win the match for a side as the team could score only 140/9 in 20 overs. After securing a decisive victory against the Orcas, TSK advanced to the playoffs in third place and are now set to encounter MI New York in the eliminator at their home ground in Dallas."

        "body": "Texas Super Kings ended the Major League Cricket 2024 season on a high. The biggest highlight of the day was Mitchell Santner who played a brief knock of 15 from 16 balls with one four and one six.\n\nThe incident happened on the fifth ball of the 11th over of the Texas Super Kings innings. Ali Sheikh, bowling over the wicket, bowled the ball short outside the off-stump. Santner got into the perfect line off the ball and sent it sailing over the stands as the ball went into the car park.\n\nThe joy for the Kiwi was short-lived as he was out in the very next over. Michael Bracewell gave the ball lots of flight as Santner tried to hit yet another six. Having mistimed the shot, Santner saw the ball being caught by Shubham Ranjane.\n\nTexas Super Kings end group phase on a high\n\nSeattle Orcas won the toss and put Texas Super Kings into bat. Ayan Desai struck first when he dismissed Devon Conway for a duck. Cameron Gannon then got the wicket of Joshua Trump for 6 to reduce Texas to 12/2. Faf Du Plessis and Milind Kumar then added 37 runs for the 4th wicket in just 20 balls.\n\nThat stand was broken when Keemo Paul had the big wicket of Du Plessis for 39 off 17 balls. At 113/6 the Texas side seemed to be in trouble with the loss of constant wickets. This is when Colin Savage and Cameron Stevenson added 43 runs for the 7th wicket. Colin Savage was not out on 45 off 27 balls to help Texas reach 177/6 from their 20 overs.\n\nJust like Texas in the first innings, Seattle lost the wicket of Ryan Rickelton for a first-ball duck to Ottniel Baartman. Quinton De Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya then added 52 runs for the 2nd wicket before the wheels came off. The loss of Jayasuriya for 24 dismissed by Colin Savage says Seattle lost 4 wickets for 15 runs.\n\nFrom there the Texas bowlers didn’t take their foot off the pedal as they kept taking wickets at regular intervals. With figures of 3/20 from his 4 overs, Baartman was the best bowler for Texas Super Kings."
