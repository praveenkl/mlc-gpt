This time around, though, LAKR started with a 12-run victory over the Texas Super Kings in Dallas with an excellent performance, spearheaded by Ali Khan, limiting the hosts throughout their run chase.\n\nLAST THREE: LWWLL\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS FORM: POOR START FOR SEATTLE\n\nOn the other hand, the Seattle Orcas started their 2024 season by being annihilated by MI New York, who defeated them in the final last year. They were skittled for just 108 before allowing that to be comfortably chased, taking just four wickets in 14.2 overs. That leaves them bottom-of-the-table, albeit having played just one game.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWL\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nLAKR’s shortcomings were, though, shown up in their second match when they suffered a six-wicket loss to the San Francisco Unicorns. There is a lack of batting depth or even just batting strength and setting a target of 166 against the Unicorns was nowhere near enough with the opposition chasing it down in just 15.2 overs. It is quite an ageing side with Jason Roy, Sunil Narine, Shakib Al Hasan and Andre Russell but the one player they should bee able to rely upon is David Miller so the South African to be their best batter in this match seems a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, after taking a four-wicket haul in their opening game, Ali Khan went wicket-less against the Unicorns and the attention turned to Aussie quick Spencer Johnson, who took 3-26. Johnson has been excellent since emerging in the last 12-18 months and the left armer to take two or more wickets once again would appear quite likely.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThere is no real pattern to emerge from the Seattle Orcas yet given they have played just one game but there will be fewer concerns about their batting line-up. Quinton de Kock’s form is a question but middle-order hitting from Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen and Harmeet Singh should mean they stay in more matches – unlike against an impressive MI New York. Klaasen is the form player and now, as captain, will need to take some responsibility so a 30+ score from him would be worth backing.\n\nMI New York had the luxury of going slowly in their chase of 109 but that doesn’t mean there wasn’t some good bowling from Nandre Burger and Zaman Khan. It does appear a fairly weak attack, though, and Burger will have to be at the top of his game with him being their best bowler most likely to happen more often than not.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS SEATTLE ORCAS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nIn terms of who will come out on top, despite their very different first seasons in which LAKR finished rock-bottom and Seattle finished top, these are two very different sides. On paper, the Orcas should be set with De Kock at the top but the South African has been out of form for a while now, despite some flashes at the ICC T20 World Cup. If Johnson continues to open the bowling then backing Johnson to have a major impact on the match, up against De Kock initially, will be worth keeping an eye on."

Jason Roy and Sunil Narine got out cheaply. After their dismissals, Unmukt Chand played a fine knock of 68 runs in 45 balls. He hit 6 fours and 3 huge sixes during his innings. Nitish Kumar also played a nice cameo of 26 runs in 17 balls to help LA Knight Riders get to 162 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Devon Conway and Faf du Plessis started off really well for Texas Super Kings. They stitched a partnership of 30 runs for the first wicket. A couple of wickets fell in quick succession in the middle order and Super Kings all of a sudden looked in deep waters. Devon Conway kept on batting well and made 53 runs off 39 balls but he barely got any support at the other end as Texas Super Kings were restricted to 150 for 8 in 20 overs, losing the match by 12 runs.\n\nBatting Stats T20\n\nCurrent Form Washington Freedom:\n\nWashington Freedom are currently placed at the 3rd position on points table with 1 win to their credit.\n\nThe top run scorer for Washington Freedom in the Major League Cricket is Steven Smith with 46 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Washington Freedom in the Major League Cricket is Saurabh Netravalkar with 3 scalps under his belt.\n\nWashington Freedom have won their previous match against MI New York by 4 runs (DLS method).\n\nMI New York batted first and they posted a total of 154 for 9 in 20 overs. The start wasn't encouraging but Nicholas Pooran made sure that he didn't throw his wicket away. Pooran made 44 runs off 30 balls and laid the foundation for a big total. After he got out, Rashid Khan took over the role of an enforcer. He scored 31 off 15 balls and took MI New York to 154 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Washington Freedom lost Travis Head quite early. After his dismissal, Steven Smith let loose and smashed Anrich Nortje for 22 runs in his first over. Then the rain arrived and Washington Freedom were ahead in the DLS calculation by 4 runs. The match couldn't restart again and Washington Freedom were declared winners by 4 runs (DLS method).\n\nWicket Takers T20\n\nLet’s have a look at the squads:\n\nTexas Super Kings- Rusty Theron, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Imran Tahir, Calvin Savage, Faf du Plessis, Marcus Stoinis, Gerald Coetzee, Devon Conway, Milind Kumar, Zia Shahzad, Mohammad Mohsin, Matthew Tromp, Naveen-ul-Haq, Dwayne Bravo, Daniel Sams, Cody Chetty, Noor Ahmad,Sami Aslam, Mitchell Santner, Zia ul-Haq, Lahiru Milantha, Cameron Stevenson\n\nWashington Freedom- Rachin Ravindra, Ian Holland, Akeal Hosein, Lockie Ferguson, Justin Dill, Jack Edwards, Lahiru Milantha, Andries Gous, Amila Aponso, Steve Smith, Saurabh Netravalkar, Yasir Mohammed, Obus Pienaar, Glenn Maxwell, Akhilesh Bodugum, Marco Jansen, Mukhtar Ahmed, Andrew Tye, Travis Head\n\nMost 6's T20"

SFU managed to chase down the 166-run target by the 16th over itself with the help of blazing knocks from Finn Allen and Matthew Short. Allen smashed 63 runs off 37 balls and Short played an astonishing innings of 58 runs off just 26 balls. Both of them helped the team pick up a comfortable win against the Knights.\n\n“Nice to see Finn and Shorty take the bowlers down. The boundaries aren't big. It's ideal to chase in the night but you got to bat well too. You don't have to tell them much (his top three batters). The way they play the game is extremely aggressive. That's going to come with ups and downs. He (Brady Couch) was fantastic today,” said SFU captain Corey Anderson in the post-match presentation.\n\nMORE ON SPORTS TAK:\n\nWATCH - Abhishek Sharma's parents' reaction to son's maiden International century will melt your heart, sister Komal shares beautiful video\n\nFlop in T20 World Cup, New Zealand opener and Punjab Kings batter's fifties help San Francisco Unicorns beat LA Knight Riders by 6 wickets\n\nPat Cummins makes false claim about Australia cricket while suggesting specific Test cricket window to avoid clash with franchise leagues"

        "body": "The fifth match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket between Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings was washed out due to rain, resulting in both teams sharing a point each at Church Street Park in Morrisville on Monday. What could have been a high-scoring thriller was thwarted by the weather.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nWashington Freedom *62/0 (4.0 ov)\n\nTexas Super Kings 203/5 (20 ov)\n\nResult - Match abandoned\n\nSCORECARD\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nIn the first innings, Faf du Plessis showcased his class with an emphatic century, leading the Texas Super Kings to a huge total of 203/5 in 20 overs. Washington Freedom, on the other hand, came out all guns blazing. The Australian duo of Steve Smith and Travis Head got the run-chase going immediately, reaching 37/0 after three overs. Head, who was dropped by Dwayne Bravo off Zia-ul-Haq on the last ball of the third over, went on to score 24 runs, including two sixes and two fours, in the fourth over. Washington Freedom reached 61/0 after 4 overs before rain halted play.\n\nWith the minimum five overs not completed in the second innings, the DLS method couldn't be applied, hence the match ended in a no result and shared points. Both opening games of Washington Freedom have been rain-affected thus far, but they remain unbeaten and have jumped to the top, while Texas Super Kings are fifth in the points table.\n\nEarlier in the day, Texas Super Kings batted first. Openers Faf du Plessis and birthday boy Devon Conway got Texas Super Kings off to a flying start as they reached 67/0 in the Powerplay. Skipper du Plessis batted fluently while Conway played a supporting role, with the duo adding 109 runs in no time. Conway was the first to fall, dismissed by Saurabh Netravalkar in the 11th over after scoring 39 runs off 26 balls. The Super Kings then lost their second wicket in the following over when Aaron Hardie (2 off 5) was trapped LBW by Akeal Hosein, leaving them at 114/2 after 12 overs.\n\nAussie all-rounder Marcus Stoinis joined du Plessis and kept the scoreboard ticking at a rapid pace. Despite picking up an injury to his right hand in the 14th over, Stoinis played a vital cameo of 29 off 18 balls, forming a partnership of 62 off 29 balls with the skipper before being caught by Mukhtar Ahmed off Justin Dill in the 17th over.\n\nMeanwhile, du Plessis continued as he reached his century in 56 balls, taking the Texas Super Kings to 188/3 after 18 overs. He was immediately caught by Steve Smith at extra cover off Saurabh Netravalkar in the following over, but the TSK batters ensured they crossed the 200-run mark. This was the first time a score of 200 was achieved at this venue and the first time any team crossed this mark this season, courtesy of du Plessis' remarkable knock of 100 off 58, which included 12 boundaries and five sixes.\n\nRuns\n\nMatch Stats\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-109 (Devon Conway - 10.2 ov), 2-114 (Aaron Hardie - 11.6 ov), 3-176 (Marcus Stoinis - 16.5 ov), 4-189 (Faf du Plessis - 18.3 ov), 5-193 (Calvin Savage - 19.1 ov\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets:\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nTravis Head\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nJustin Dill\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nAkeal Hosein\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nNaveen ul Haq\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Monday, July 8, 2024 20:30\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville\n\nToss: Washington Freedom elected to bowl"

The duo looked poised for a strong partnership when the rain halted their progress.\n\nDespite an hour-long wait for the weather to clear, match officials eventually decided to call off the game, resulting in both teams sharing a point each from the rain-affected match.\n\nThis encounter was significant as it marked the first instance of any team surpassing 200 runs this season and also the first occurrence of a 200-run total at Church Street Park.\n\nEarlier in the match, Texas Super Kings, led by captain Faf du Plessis, set an impressive total of 203 for 5 in their 20 overs. Du Plessis delivered a stellar performance, scoring a brilliant century off 58 balls.\n\nHis innings were marked by aggressive and calculated shots, consistently punishing any loose deliveries from the Washington bowlers. Devon Conway provided crucial support, scoring 39 runs off 26 balls. Together, du Plessis and Conway built a solid 109-run partnership for the opening wicket.\n\nDespite dealing with an injured right hand, Marcus Stoinis contributed a vital 29 runs off 18 balls, further boosting the Texas Super Kings' total. However, Washington Freedom's bowling and fielding were below par, with several dropped catches and missed opportunities that allowed the Texas Super Kings to amass their substantial total.\n\nWhile the rain ultimately denied what could have been an exciting finish, both teams displayed promising performances. The Washington Freedom's explosive start in their chase and the Texas Super Kings' formidable batting display, particularly from Faf du Plessis, set a high standard for the rest of the season.\n\nBoth teams will look to build on these performances as the Major League Cricket season progresses, aiming to secure their positions in the tournament standings."

Bowlers should get much of the credit for restricting defending champions to 154 on the board. Saurabh Netravalkar and Justin Dill inflicted more damage, picking up 3 wickets apiece. Smith's captaincy was on point as the Australian made clever bowling changes and set the right field. Travis Head’s MLC debut didn’t go well as he was dismissed for a one-handed stunner from Nicholas Pooran for just one. They felt extremely satisfied after collecting crucial points first up and eager to carry forward the same for the rest of the tournament."

But such was the spectacle in Major League Cricket when Andre Russell launched a colossal 107-meter six off Haris Rauf, leaving his teammates in awe.\n\n‌The San Francisco Unicorns clashed with the Los Angeles Knight Riders in their opening game in Dallas. Unicorns skipper Corey Anderson won the toss and chose to bowl first, a decision that initially proved effective as IPL MVP Sunil Narine was scalped by Haris Rauf in the second over. With Jason Roy and Unmukt Chand’s dismissal, the Knight Riders struggled at 46/3 after seven overs. However, a vital 45-run partnership between Shakib Al Hasan and Nitish Kumar took them to 88/3 by the 11th over. It was Andre Russell's explosive innings, featuring a colossal 107-meter six, that then further propelled the purple brigade to a solid 165/6 in 20 overs.\n\nThe West Indian powerhouse walked in to bat in the 13th over following Kumar's dismissal. Russell took some time to find his rhythm but began his onslaught from the 16th over onwards, saving the most spectacular moment for the 20th over. On the third ball of the final over, Rauf delivered a short-length ball angled into the stumps. Russell used his flawless judgment as he stood tall and unleashed a mighty pull shot. The timing was impeccable, and the sweet sound of the bat carried the ball out of the ground for a maximum. The shot travelled an astounding 351 feet, marking the longest six of the season. The Knight Riders' dugout, especially Shakib, was momentarily in disbelief at the incredible display.\n\nRussell-Mania at Dallas\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0"

        "body": "Global star Faf du Plessis lit up the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas with his magnificent century in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. Leading the Texas Super Kings (TSK) against the Washington Freedom (WF), Du Plessis dazzled with the bat, smashing a tremendous ton to announce his grand arrival in the US T20 tournament.\n\nStruggles in previous MLC season\n\nNotably, Du Plessis didn’t have a good time with the bat in MLC. He scored only 47 runs in the previous season of the exciting tournament and his start in the ongoing edition wasn’t promising either.. The right-handed batter managed just 14 runs in TSK’s opening game against the Los Angeles Knight Riders (LKR). Under significant pressure, Du Plessis needed to find his form, and he did so emphatically with a spectacular three-figure score.\n\nA tremendous century to mark his return\n\nDuring his stay in the middle, Du Plessis smashed 12 fours and five sixes to exhibit a batting brilliance. He was dismissed for exact 100 runs from 58 deliveries by Saurabh Netravalkar. Notably, on the last ball of the 18th over, Du Plessis reached the milestone by driving the slower leg-cutter pitched full outside off Lockie Ferguson for a boundary. Overall, it was his 6th hundred in the shortest format and the entire TSK dugout was up to applaud their captain’s knock.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Finn Allen slams Shakib Al Hasan for a hat-trick of sixes as SFU defeat LAKR in MLC 2024\n\nRain spoils the exciting match\n\nDriving on Du Plessis brilliant century, the Super Kings posted a massive total of 203/5 in 20 overs. However, his magical ton went in vain as the match ended without a result due to rain. Washington started their chase strongly, scoring 62 runs in just four overs with Travis Head (32 runs off 12 balls) and Steve Smith (26 runs off 13 balls) looking well set. Unfortunately, rain intervened after four overs, preventing the match from restarting. As a result, the game was cancelled, and both sides shared a point each."

        "body": "In a thrilling match of the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024, the San Francisco Unicorns defeated the Los Angeles Knight Riders by six wickets at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday, July 8. The star of the show was New Zealand opener Finn Allen, who put on a spectacular display of power-hitting against the Knight Riders’ bowling attack.\n\nFinn Allen’s carnage against LAKR\n\nAllen smashed Shakib Al Hasan for three consecutive sixes in the fifth over, sending the ball deep into the stands. He continued his onslaught in the seventh over, hitting Andre Russell for two more maximums, taking his tally to five sixes across the two overs.\n\nHere’s the video\n\nAllen’s blistering knock of 63 off just 37 balls, at a strike rate of 170.27, laid the foundation for the Unicorns’ successful chase. He was ably supported by Matthew Short, who scored a quickfire 58 off 26 deliveries, as the pair added 116 runs for the second wicket.\n\nMatch summary\n\nThe Knight Riders, after being put in to bat first, posted a competitive total of 165/6 in their allotted 20 overs. Shakib (35) and Russell (40 off 25 balls) were the main contributors with the bat for the Knight Riders. For the Unicorns, Brody Couch and Haris Rauf picked up two wickets each, while Abrar Ahmad and Liam Plunkett chipped in with one apiece.\n\nIn response, the Unicorns got off to a flying start, thanks to the explosive batting of Allen and Short. Allen, in particular, was in a belligerent mood as he took on the Knight Riders’ bowlers, especially Shakib and Russell.\n\nThe Unicorns eventually reached their target in 15.2 overs, winning the match by six wickets. Spencer Johnson was the pick of the bowlers for the Knight Riders, finishing with figures of 3/30.\n\nAlso READ: Andre Russell smokes gigantic 107m six off Haris Rauf in SFU vs LAKR game\n\nWords from the match-winning duo\n\nSpeaking at the post-match presentation, a delighted Allen said, “It was a great team effort. The bowlers set it up nicely for us, and we just had to go out there and express ourselves. I’m glad I could contribute with the bat and help the team get over the line.”\n\nShort, who was named the Player of the Match, echoed Allen’s sentiments of the dressing room, saying, “We are joking in the change room as to who can hit the biggest sixes. I think the pitch got better to bat on under lights, probably dew played a part as well. This tournament has a lot of good players.”\n\nThe win puts the Unicorns in a strong position in the MLC 2024 standings, while the Knight Riders will look to bounce back in their next match. With players like Allen and Short in their ranks, the Unicorns will be a force to be reckoned with in the tournament."

The match between the two teams took place at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday (8th July).\n\nPlaying for Los Angeles Knight Riders, Andre Russell played a sensational innings for his team and made sure that he helped them post a decent total on the board. The all-rounder oozed his class with the bat and exhibited great power-hitting skills during the fag end of the innings.\n\nWith the Los Angeles Knight Riders struggling at 96/5, Andre Russell stepped up for his team and made sure that he bailed the team out of trouble. He counter-attacked the bowlers and brought his team back into the game with his powerful knock while batting against San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nOne of the highlights of Andre Russell's innings was the massive 107-meter that he hit against Haris Rauf. During the last over, the pacer bowled a short ball angling in, to which the batter lined it up and smashed it over wide long-on for a massive six.\n\nThe massive six by Andre Russell left the pacer Haris Rauf in shock as he didn't expect the batter to hit the six this far. Apart from the pacer, Los Angeles Knight Riders players in the dugout looked extremely jubilant as the ball went out of the ground for a massive six and the crowd at the stadium went berserk.\n\nHere's video of Andre Russel's massive six against Haris Rauf:\n\nAndre Russell ended with the innings of unbeaten 40 runs off 25 balls. He batted with a strike rate of 160 and also hit 2 fours and 3 sixes in his innings. His brutal innings in the end powered Los Angeles Knight Riders to a total of 165 runs, which at one moment seemed impossible.\n\nHowever, his effort went in vain as San Francisco Unicorns went on to win the game pretty easily. Finn Allen (63) and Matthew Short (58) played magnificently well and helped their team win the game by 6 wickets and inside the 16 overs.\n\nWe were 15-20 runs short - Los Angels Knight Riders skipper Sunil Narine\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders skipper Sunil Narine talked about the loss that his side faced against San Francisco Unicorns. He admitted that they were 15-20 runs short and also failed to take early wickets. He was confident of doing well in the next game. Speaking after the match, he stated:\n\n\"We had to take early wickets, 15-20 runs short. We could have taken early wickets but didn't bowl well. We got 160 in two games so we aren't too far from getting a big score. Just about batters digging deep. I back myself with my decisions. I didn't work today, hopefully, they work in the next game,\" he concluded."

Medium-pacer Justin Dill picked up 3/33 while Nicholas Pooran scored 44 from 30 balls for MI NY.\n\nIn response, Smith hit three sixes and four boundaries to top-score in the contest with an unbeaten 46 off just 28 balls. We moved to 55/1 in 7.4 overs before rain intervened with us being ahead of the par score of 51 as per the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern system, a method for calculating par scores and targets in rain-affected matches.\n\nBowling first, Marco Jansen struck for us as early as the third over with Dill also picking up a wicket in the powerplay. We managed to keep MI NY to 39/2 after the first six overs.\n\nGlenn Maxwell started his journey with us in the MLC with a wicket in his first over and Netravalkar provided a crucial breakthrough dismissing MI NY skipper Kieron Pollard with half the side back as the score read 91.\n\nThough Lockie Ferguson dismissed dangerman Pooran, MI NY bounced back with a quickfire 33-run partnership for the eighth wicket. Netravalkar picked up two wickets in the final over, including Rashid Khan who scored 31, to bring us back in the game.

Chasing 155 runs, Washington already had 55 runs on board courtesy to captain Steve Smith’s blistering 46 (28) runs knock.\n\nBefore the play halted due to bad lighting, Smith’s side were four runs ahead and were awarded a win as per DLS method.\n\nWashington Freedom were calculative throughout the game. Saurabh Netravalkar and Justin Dill bowled beautifully to chip 3 wickets each. Despite Rashid Khan’s late onslaught, Washington restricted them to a decent total, and skipper Smith took care of the rest of the chase.\n\nHence, ahead of the game against Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom are expected to start as favourites.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nOn the other hand, the Texas Super Kings had a nightmarish start to the MLC 2024 season with a 12-run defeat against the Los Angeles Knight Riders. They bowled well to restrict Sunil Narine’s side to 162 runs.\n\nHowever, Super Kings failed to convert Devon Conway’s 53 (39) start to suffer an unnecessary collapse. Ali Khan took four wickets to grab the player of the match award.\n\nThat being said, to overpower Washington Freedom, the Super Kings have to take responsibility with the bat, especially captain Faf du Plessis Marcus Stoining and Aaron Hardie must play anchor roles, which will boost the confidence of the openers for the rest of the tournament.\n\nOther than that, Texas Super Kings is a well balanced side capable of making a long run into the tournament.\n\nWAS Vs TSK: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nWAS Vs TSK: Church Street Park Pitch Report\n\nChurch Street’s pitch has stayed even for both batters and bowlers so far in the tournament. With weather playing a big role, batting first and putting runs on the board is advisable. Seamers can make a huge impact given the favourable conditions. Anything around 170 should be a winning total.\n\nWAS Vs TSK: Probable playing XIs\n\nWashington Freedom: Travis Head, Andries Gous (wk), Steven Smith (c), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Justin Dill, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nTexas Super Kings: Faf du Plessis (c), Devon Conway (wk), Aaron Hardie, Joshua Tromp, Marcus Stoinis, Milind Kumar, Calvin Savage, Gerald Coetzee, Mohammad Mohsin, Naveen-ul-Haq, Zia-ul-Haq\n\nWAS Vs TSK: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nWAS Vs TSK: Winner Prediction\n\nWashington Freedom and Texas Super Kings are more or less even with the squad strength and balance. However, given the recent form and conditions, Washington is likely to win this contest comfortably."

        "body": "Steve Smith will lead Washington Freedom’s charge in Major League Cricket 2024.\n\nSmith will join our leadership group alongside former Australian skipper and legend Ricky Ponting, who has been appointed as our coach this season.\n\n“Good to be here. Looking forward to taking part in this year’s tournament (MLC). We have a really exciting squad,” Smith said ahead of our first practice session.\n\n“We will try and bring everyone together as quickly as possible and hopefully play some good cricket. We are going to go out there, doing our best to win games for the Freedom”\n\nSmith takes the baton from fellow Australian Moises Henriques, who led us to a third-place finish in the inaugural edition of the MLC last year.\n\nSmith led Australia in 38 Test matches from 2014 to 2023, winning 21 of those and losing just 10. He was also in charge of 58 One-Day Internationals for Australia, with the team winning 30 of those matches.\n\nUnder Smith’s astute leadership, Australia continued its prior dominance in international cricket across all formats.\n\nApart from captaincy, Smith is also one of the best batters in modern-day international cricket with loads of runs across formats. In 109 Tests for the Aussies, Smith has amassed 9685 at an average of just under 57. He has also accumulated 5446 runs in ODIs averaging close to 44.\n\nSmith is also an experienced customer in T20 cricket having played a total of 246 T20s across the globe including 67 T20Is for Australia. He has more than 5000 runs, including three centuries, with a healthy average of 30.79 in the shortest format.\n\nSmith became the first player from Sydney Sixers to score a century in the Big Bash League T20 tournament in 2023 and followed it up with another hundred in the space of just four days.\n\nSmith is also the proud owner of several records and achievements throughout his playing career. He was the youngest player to be awarded the ICC Cricketer of the Year at the age of just 26. He also won the ICC Men’s Test Player of the Decade award from 2011-2020.\n\nSmith is the fastest Australian and sixth-fastest ever to reach 10000 runs in international cricket. He is also the only player to win the ICC Test Player of the Year more than once.\n\nSmith’s experience as a captain and player will help us in our journey forward in the MLC. Here’s wishing Steve Smith a great season ahead with us in the MLC."

        "body": "Los Angeles Knight Riders Triumph Over Texas Super Kings by 12 Runs in MLC 2024 Opener\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders showcased a stellar performance to defeat the Texas Super Kings by 12 runs in the second match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas.\n\nUnmukt Chand’s impressive 68 off 45 balls powered the LA Knight Riders to a total of 162/7 in their 20 overs. Ali Khan then delivered a match-winning spell, taking four wickets for 33 runs, restricting the Texas Super Kings to 150/8 and sealing the victory.\n\nChasing 163, the Texas Super Kings started cautiously on a challenging batting wicket. Skipper Faf du Plessis (14 off 14) tried to accelerate but was dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the fifth over, caught by Derone Davis at mid-wicket. Aaron Hardie (11 off 14) fell to Shakib Al Hasan in the ninth over.\n\nOpener Devon Conway kept the Super Kings in the hunt with timely boundaries. However, Ali Khan turned the game around for the Knight Riders by taking three wickets in the 14th over. He bowled Conway, dismissed Joshua Tromp (18 off 14) with a catch by Derone Davis, and had Milind Kumar (0 off 1) caught at slip by Andre Russell. Marcus Stoinis (2 off 6) fell in the following over, leaving the Super Kings reeling from 100/2 to 107/6 after 15 overs.\n\nCalvin Savage then kept the Super Kings’ hopes alive with a flurry of boundaries and sixes. Along with Naveen-ul-Haq, he smashed 17 runs off Ali Khan in the 18th over, bringing the equation down to 27 runs from 12 balls. However, Russell and Khan bowled exceptional final overs to close out the game for the Knight Riders.\n\nEarlier, Texas Super Kings won the toss and opted to bowl first. Zia-ul-Haq shook the LA Knight Riders’ lineup, dismissing openers Jason Roy (2 off 11) and Sunil Narine (2 off 3) in the third over, leaving them at 10/2.\n\nUnmukt Chand and Shakib Al Hasan attempted to steady the innings, but Shakib fell to Aaron Hardie in the seventh over after scoring 18 off 13 balls. Nitish Kumar added 26 runs off 17 deliveries before being dismissed in the 11th over, with the score at 78/4.\n\nDespite losing key players like David Miller (4 off 9) and Andre Russell (10 off 5), Chand held one end, scoring a magnificent 68 off 45 balls, with six boundaries and three sixes, anchoring the Knight Riders’ innings. He was dismissed in the last over, but Corne Dry’s three fours off Marcus Stoinis powered the Knight Riders to a respectable total of 162/7."

        "body": "Unmukt Chand opened up on his absence from the USA’s squad for the recently concluded T20 World Cup. Chand Won former India U-19 World Cup winning captain took retirement from Indian cricket in 2021 before moving to the USA for more promising cricket matches. Having played in the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) besides other franchised tournaments Chand became eligible to represent the USA. He also indicated readiness to play against India in the T 20 world Cup before being dropped from the squad.\n\nChand made it known that he was shocked being left out of the T20 World Cup squad, and said he felt as if he were being sucked in.\n\nIn his interaction with Cricbuzz Chand said , “That wasn’t the best position to be in, really. Because, for me personally, this was my dream for three years. It was a big shock, clearly. It took me a while to accept it. When you are a player, it is never going to be easy; you have lost everything back home in India and then this one thing that has been your driving force for the last three years just doesn’t come through; so it is tough. I won’t say it just happened. But it wasn’t easy.”\n\nHis inner demons were also spoken about by Chand saying that it needed many ups and downs in order to conquer such a feeling\n\n“It was quite an internal battle and basically quite frustrating. It just sucks you in all the time. It would last a day and then disappear and then return again. It hit me in different phases of reality. When you go through that over and over again you automatically become better at it. At some point you will admit that it was not even what happened, that is all about it. Not even considering it anymore,” he added.\n\nChand is now currently focused on playing Major league cricket for Los Angeles Knight Riders."
