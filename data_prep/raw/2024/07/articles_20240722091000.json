        "date": "Mon Jul 22 01:00:00 2024",
        "body": "After many U.S. sports fans got their first taste of elite cricket during this summer’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup hosted partially in Florida, New York, and Texas, the country’s burgeoning professional competition is making noticeable strides in its second season.\n\nMajor League Cricket will finish its 21-match schedule this week before a four-team playoff crowns a new champion. While the league has six teams from coast to coast, all matches have been played at two cricket-specific venues in Texas and North Carolina. Still, attendance is tracking to potentially surpass the 70,000 fans who showed up for the inaugural season in 2023.\n\nMLC’s media rights are held by a niche cricket-focused channel called Willow by Cricbuzz. But the broadcaster struck deals with mainstream regional sports networks in each team’s market in an effort to attract more fans.\n\nDallas: Bally Sports Southwest\n\nLos Angeles: Bally Sports SoCal\n\nWashington, D.C.: Monumental Sports Network\n\nSan Francisco: NBC Sports Bay Area\n\nSeattle: Root Sports\n\nNew York: YES Network\n\nWillow took a similar approach during the T20 World Cup to get more exposure.\n\nMoney Game\n\nTeams in MLC operate under a $1.15 million salary cap. While that’s well under the roughly $12 million that franchises can spend annually in the world’s richest cricket competition, the Indian Premier League, it’s not far off from other global leagues like Cricket Australia ($2 million) and The Hundred ($1.3 million) in the U.K.\n\n“The money is good. But also the product’s good,” says Liam Plunkett (above, far right), a bowler for the San Francisco Unicorns who was a member of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup. “I think if the product wasn’t rolled out and the standard wasn’t good, people wouldn’t be that interested in coming across.”\n\nPlunkett has remained impressed with the quality of play two seasons in. “I think there were a lot of teething problems leading up to it, but when the competition started, it felt like you could be playing anywhere in the world,” he says.\n\nBig Ambitions\n\nBefore this season, San Francisco made a splash when it signed Australia national team captain Pat Cummins to a four-year contract. Have those moves been difficult to make? “Surprisingly not,” Anand Rajaraman, a co-owner of the Unicorns, tells Front Office Sports. “I think everybody in the cricket world is excited about the possibility of the U.S. market.”\n\nPlunkett echoes that sentiment. “There’s definitely opportunities,” he says of being in the U.S. “Are you looking to play some good cricket? But also, are you looking to do some business deals and build yourself even further as a brand?”"

        "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani, and other deep-pocketed investors worth a collective $126 billion own franchises in Major League Cricket. But launching a new major sports league in the United States has long been a sticky wicket.\n\nBy Sofia Chierchio, Contributor\n\nInside a crowded cricket stadium in Bangalore, India, as the Indian Premier League prepared to begin its inaugural match in April 2008, Anurag Jain gazed at the owner’s balcony as a familiar Hindi song pumped up the many fans in attendance. “Someday, I want to play that song and stand on the balcony like that guy,” he recalls saying. “It wasn’t about vanity; it was about bringing this sport that my family and friends enjoyed together to [America]—my home.”\n\nIn India, cricket is widely considered the most popular sport in the country, both by participation and viewership. Yet as successful as it may be in the UK and other former British colonies, the sport has hardly gained a foothold in the United States. But the 62-year-old Jain—chairman of Access Healthcare, a Dallas-based healthcare company—and a group of deep-pocketed investors—including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan and Jain’s co-owner, Texas real estate developer Ross Perot Jr.—are betting they can finally change that.\n\nIn 2019, American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the San Francisco-based parent company of Major League Cricket (MLC), pledged $1 billion to develop the sport in the U.S. Three years later, MLC secured $120 million in funding. With just six teams—New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Washington, DC—the inaugural 2023 season attracted some 70,000 fans across its games, generating an exceedingly modest $8 million in revenue. With its sophomore season, which began on July 5, underway, MLC is looking to capitalize on surging global interest in the sport, which was bolstered by Team USA’s upset of Pakistan in the Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup in June.\n\n“We're very serious as a collective,” says former Microsoft executive Sanjay Parthasarathy, who co-owns the Seattle Orcas with Nadella. “We're seasoned businesspeople. So, we have a discipline, a business discipline. We're running this like a startup. We're pinching pennies. We've got to invest in the right places so we're not throwing money around for sure.”\n\nMLC’s backers, many of whom are of Indian descent, don’t have to look too far to find a model for success. Established in 2008, the Indian Premier League (IPL) revolutionized cricket by adopting the T20 format, a shorter, more dynamic version of the game. Traditional cricket matches can last for days, but T20 cricket condensed the action into three and a half hours of energetic play, making it more appealing to a wider audience. And the value of IPL clubs has skyrocketed in recent years, with the average value of the league’s 10 teams crossing $1 billion in 2022, according to Forbes’ most recent valuations.\n\nAnd much as Major League Soccer had to overcome the fact that American soccer fans can already watch the world’s best leagues in the United States, the MLC has to contend with an fanbase that is already tuning in to IPL matches on Willow TV, the main broadcaster of cricket in the US.\n\n“The Commonwealth Diaspora has always looked at sports differently than the core American audience,” Parthasarathy says of the TV challenges. “There is an intersection between the diaspora and the hardcore American sports, so there’s a lot of opportunity to be tapped into. That’s the core; it doesn’t mean that’s where we end.”\n\nFor now, according to some owners, the goal for this season is simply to build on the product that debuted last year. The league also has a five-year broadcast partnership with Willow, its most substantial source of revenue. MLC also generates income from ticket sales and sponsorships, taking a page out of the Formula 1 playbook. “One of the biggest sources of income are the logos plastered on our jerseys,” Jain says. “In fact, I think we are the first team to get all of our logo spots sold this year, which I think is an amazing achievement.”\n\nBut if cricket is going to be successful in America, a massive investment in infrastructure is needed. Veteran Silicon Valley venture capitalist Anand Rajaraman, co-owner of the San Francisco Unicorns, estimates that a single purpose-built stadium in the Bay Area would cost at least $30 million.\n\n“You’ve got to have world-class places where people can train and play,” Parthasarathy emphasizes. “You can’t play on a baseball diamond because one of the big aspects of cricket is the pitch. It’s got to be well done and done the right way. Those facilities are really important, and I see that happening over the next 10 years.”\n\nIn addition to infrastructure for stadiums, many MLC owners believe that attracting a broader cricket audience goes hand-in-padded-glove with cultivating domestic talent. According to MLC rules, of the 11 cricketers on the pitch, at least five must be American players. Sanjay Govil, founder of the Maryland-based Infinite Computer Solutions and owner of the Washington Freedom, believes this strategy allows homegrown talent to learn from some of the best international coaches and players.\n\nCricket is expected to get another major boost when it makes its Olympic return in 2028 after a 128-year hiatus. Taking place in Los Angeles, the increased attention could be monumental in growing the new league.\n\n“I think it's extremely important that the world sees cricket at that stage,” Jain claims. “You’ll see how cricket grows because of the Olympics, but most important to us, it's coming here, it's coming to our country.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesIPL Cricket Team Values Would Soar With A $30 Billion Saudi InvestmentForbesThe World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams 2024"

It underlines further the importance of their victory last time out over Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: WLA\n\nMI NEW YORK FORM: A REVERSAL OF FORTUNES ESSENTIAL TO SAVE THEIR SEASON.\n\nLosing three games on the spin heading into this final group game has left MI New York on the outside looking in and even beating the Knight Riders here may not be enough for them to break into the top four. A significant net-run-rate swing is also required for them to overhaul Los Angeles.\n\nLAST THREE: LLL\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nExperience is key for Los Angeles Knight Riders in a contest of such magnitude, which could see bettors turn to all-rounder Andre Russell when it comes to investing in their players here. Russell offers value in multiple markets but with MINY forced to play aggressively with the bat in a bid to pile up quick runs, this may play to the strengths of the West Indian. His variations make backing him to accumulate 2+ wickets a shrewd play.\n\nJason Roy is a player that can so often get whatever team he plays for off to a good start and LAKR will hope for the same on this occasion. Roy struck 27 in a win over rock-bottom Seattle Orcas and even if he wasn’t to gain a really big score, even a cameo could be crucial. Therefore, consider backing Roy to put up over 23.5 match runs.\n\nMI NEW YORK BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWe’ve highlighted the big-hitting abilities of Dewald Brevis previously and the young South African didn’t let bettors down against San Francisco Unicorns last time out, striking 56 from 36 balls. Brevis cleared the boundary rope three times and stakes on him to not only score 20+ runs here, but also to hit over 0.5 match sixes has to be favoured in a must-win game.\n\nTrent Boult’s potency with the ball will be crucial both in the powerplay and the death. Early wickets especially has to be seen as essential for MI New York as they look to overhaul their net-run-rate deficit and the left-arm point of difference that Boult provides is ideal on this front. Back the New Zealander to take over 1.5 match wickets here as he did in his last appearance.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS MI NEW YORK EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nMI New York has no choice but to play fearlessly and aggressively, knowing that they not only need to win here, but win well to overturn the net-run-rate deficit between them and Los Angeles Knight Riders. This could go one of two ways, with either a fired-up and focused MINY blowing away their opponents, or reckless cricket ultimately costing them due to their hand being essentially forced.\n\nBut it’s important to note that LAKR don’t have prior success in this tournament and a bad start here could see doubts creep into the heads of their players. Whereas MINY have been there, done that and won the whole thing, so when it comes to the crunch win or bust games, they know how to get the job done. With that in mind, backing MI New York to win should be seriously considered, the question is whether it will be by enough of a margin to see them through to the play-offs."

        "body": "It's not just about the cricket or the money, Cummins explains, but the opportunity to think about his career after cricket\n\nMatt Roller\n\n22-Jul-2024 • 6 hrs ago\n\n1:50\n\nCummins: MLC is giving cricketers a platform in the US\n\nPat Cummins does not make Major League Cricket sound like a tough sell. \"It was like, 'do you want to come to the US for a few weeks in summer, be around a team where I'm good mates with a few of the guys, play a bit of golf and play a bit of cricket in a new country',\" he tells ESPNcricinfo from Dallas. \"I jumped at it.\"\n\nYet his lucrative four-year contract with San Francisco Unicorns was a paradigm of change in the cricket world. Cummins had only previously played in one overseas T20 league - the IPL - but his interest was piqued by the identity of the franchise's owners: Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, a pair of India-born venture capitalists based in California.\n\nFive injury-ruined years early in his career made Cummins acutely aware that professional sport is transitory. He studied business at Sydney's University of Technology during his prolonged rehabilitation, sits on the Australian Cricketers' Association's board of directors, and has used his platform to advocate for action on climate change.\n\nIt is why the owners' Silicon Valley background was the clincher for him. \"It's a space that I find super interesting, particularly the venture-capital world,\" Cummins says. \"I potentially see that as something I'd like to do more of post-cricket, so [this is] a way to align with a few of those guys, learn off them over the next few years, be around some of those conversations.\"\n\nThe tournament effectively provides him with a chance to network: since arriving in the US, Cummins has already \"informally\" discussed potential opportunities over coffee. \"If it's something I do enjoy, hopefully I could dive a little bit deeper for the back-end of my career, and then maybe move into that space a bit more professionally after cricket.\"\n\n\"For the guys that play all three formats, you're always trying to make sure you're peaking for those major events - and it feels like there's been about ten major events in the last 18 months, so I haven't really taken much time to reinvest back in my body\"\n\nPat Cummins\n\nCummins' contract with Unicorns runs until 2027. By then, he will be 34 and closer to the end of his international career. \"The intention is definitely to make this a long-term partnership,\" he says. \"Obviously playing for Australia, it's going to clash at certain times. But outside of that, I want to make sure MLC is a real focus.\"\n\nMLC remains at a nascent stage, with just 25 matches shared across two venues. But its combination of high salaries, a short window, and the novelty of playing in the US have proved attractive. Its pool of overseas players comfortably outstrips that of rival leagues, including the Hundred in England. \"I hadn't thought of the Hundred,\" Cummins admits.\n\nCummins makes it clear that, as Test and ODI captain, \"playing for Australia will come first\". Cricket Australia only made him available for four out of six MLC group games this year to manage his workload after the T20 World Cup, and his availability for the 2025 edition will depend on a potential clash with a two-match Test series in the Caribbean.\n\nHe has also been rested for Australia's white-ball tour to Scotland and England in September, giving him a prolonged break ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Tellingly, that decision received minimal pushback.\n\n\"Everyone's a little bit more realistic about the schedules nowadays,\" Cummins says. \"We spend ten-plus months of the year away on the road, so some tours probably carry a little bit more importance than others. For the guys that play all three formats, you're always trying to make sure you're peaking for those major events - and it feels like there's been about ten major events in the last 18 months, so I haven't really taken much time to reinvest back in my body.\"\n\n1:38\n\nCummins explains why he will miss the September tour to England\n\nJosh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc are part of September's tour, but Cummins had long planned to miss it. \"That window has always been earmarked as a time to really give my body a rest and do close to a full pre-season,\" he explains. \"I should get six or eight weeks off bowling and then build up again. Once this MLC opportunity came up and we mapped out the plan, it didn't really change much.\n\n\"I still get that same amount of break and then just probably start one or two weeks later heading into the summer… I'll get home, I'll have a good six or eight weeks off bowling where I'll get in the gym every day, do some running, and get some strength back into my body. And then we've got a big Test match series [against India] for our home summer, so that'll be the focus.\"\n\nCummins has only taken one wicket in three MLC appearances, but has helped Unicorns seal a top-two finish, closing out a win over MI New York on Friday night. \"It's a really high standard,\" he says. \"The calibre of players is ridiculous and for a competition in its second season, it's super organised and super competitive… I couldn't speak highly enough of it.\"\n\nAustralia played exclusively in the Caribbean during the T20 World Cup, but Cummins watched the US leg with interest: \"That Pakistan-India game looked insane… everyone talks about baseball, basketball and NFL, but there's hundreds of thousands of cricketers here going about their work quietly who are now starting to get a platform.\"\n\nUnicorns' long-term ambition is to bring MLC to California, with plans to build a stadium in San Jose. \"Hopefully that will be ready to go in the next couple of years, and I'll be coming back to San Fran a lot,\" Cummins says. That sentence alone from Australia's captain is proof that cricket has changed for good.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98"

However, Finn Allen's explosive 77 off 30 balls took the San Francisco Unicorns to a comfortable six-wicket win.\n\nWith this victory, the San Francisco Unicorns remain in second place on the points table with nine points from six matches, while the Seattle Orcas have been officially eliminated from the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nAlready qualified for the playoffs, the San Francisco Unicorns began their run chase of 153 runs at a blistering pace. They smashed 79 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to Finn Allen's 21-ball fifty. He struck 26 runs in the fifth over, bowled by Lungi Ngidi, which featured two sixes and three fours.\n\nMatthew Short, on the other hand, was dismissed by Imad Wasim in the seventh over after scoring 19 off 14 balls. Allen continued in the same vein, hitting two sixes off Harmeet Singh before being caught by Ryan Rickelton on the fifth ball of the eighth over. He scored 77 off 30 balls, leaving San Francisco at 98/2 after eight overs.\n\nThe Unicorns then lost two more wickets in consecutive overs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed for 10 off 16 balls in the 13th over, followed by Sherfane Rutherford in the 14th, who scored 17 off 8 balls. However, Josh Inglis and Corey Anderson guided San Francisco to a comfortable six-wicket win with 34 balls to spare.\n\nIn a must-win game, the Seattle Orcas faced a disastrous start after being invited to bat first. They lost both openers in the very first over: Ryan Rickelton was caught by Finn Allen on the first ball, and Aaron Jones was trapped LBW by Carmi le Roux.\n\nDespite an early setback, Seattle managed to score 48 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to an aggressive counter-attack by Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya. They added 34 runs in the last two overs of the Powerplay, bringing the score to 48/2.\n\nDe Kock reached his half-century off 28 balls by the 10th over. Alongside Jayasuriya, he added 31 runs off Pat Cummins' first two overs, pushing Seattle to 98/2 after 11 overs. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the 12th over as both de Kock and Jayasuriya were dismissed in quick succession by Brody Couch.\n\nHassan Khan then delivered a decisive blow to Seattle Orcas, as he struck thrice in his two consecutive overs. He dismissed Heinrich Klaasen in the 14th over, and Harmeet Singh and Keemo Paul in the 16th over, reducing Seattle to 116/7.\n\nIt was Shubham Ranjane, who came to the rescue as he played a crucial unbeaten knock of 26 runs off 25 balls, helping Seattle post a total of 152/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nBrief Scores: San Francisco Unicorns beat Seattle Orcas by six wickets."

Except for Ryan Rickelton, no other batter showed any promise whatsoever. The big names like Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen and Aaron Jones, all failed to get going. Rickelton smashed 89 off 52 balls but he barely got any support at the other end. Once he got out in the 19th over, it was all clear that Orcas will not reach a decent total. They were littled and only scored 142 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Sunil Narine as usual got out cheaply. Jason Roy tried his best to take control but he consumed too many balls for his knock of 27 runs. A real game changing innings was played by Unmukt Chand, who smashed 62 runs off 47 balls. He was aided by the lower order batters who contributed healthily and helped LA Knight Riders get over the line in the 20th over with 4 wickets in hand.\n\nBatting Stats T20\n\nCurrent Form MI New York:\n\nMI New York are currently placed at the 5th position on points table with 1 win and 4 losses to their credit.\n\nThe top run scorer for MI New York in the Major League Cricket is Nicholas Pooran with 137 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for MI New York in the Major League Cricket is Rashid Khan with 7 scalps under his belt.\n\nMI New York have lost their previous match against San Francisco Unicorns by a small margin of 3 runs.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns batted first and they posted a total of 148 for 7 in 20 overs. The top order struggled a lot. Their prime form batters including Matthew Short and Josh Inglis got out cheaply. They were under a lot of pressure from that moment on. The middle order of San Francisco Unicorns came good as Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan smashed 59 and 44 runs respectively to help San Francisco Unicorns get to a strong total of 148 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, MI New York lost Ruben Clinton quite early into the innings. Dewald Brevis played like a champion and he smashed 56 runs off 36 balls. He instilled the hope for a successful chase. Nicholas Pooran also supported him well, he scored 26 runs but consumed too many balls to get going. It cost the team dearly. The rest of the middle order batters including Romario Shepherd and Monank Patel failed terribly and despite the efforts of Heath Richards, who smashed 24 off 13 balls, Seattle Orcas failed to achieve the target and fell short by 3 runs in the end.\n\nWicket Takers T20"

It was MI New York who took home the win and qualified in the fourth spot for the playoffs. However, we will be back with more coverage of the Major League cricket on 23rd July. It will be a top-of-the-table clash between San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom. The first ball will be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT) but our coverage will start much earlier. Until then, goodbye and cheers!\n\nKieron Pollard the skipper of MI New York is up for a chat. He says that he is happy and congratulates his entire team for their performance. Adds that they were good with the bat in this tournament but the results were not in their favor. Mentions that this win was a complete team performance and it gave a lot of confidence to everyone. Ends by saying that their hard work paid off and will perform well further as well.\n\nSunil Narine, the captain of the Los Angeles Knight Riders is up for a chat. He says that they were some runs short and the innings by Pooran and Pollard took the game away from them. Jokes that he will have to improve his skills at the toss. Adds that batting first is always tough but it was a good tournament for them. Mentions that they tried their best and appreciates his bowlers for giving it their all. Ends by saying that they will keep fighting and that he is happy with the team balance.\n\nRashid Khan is the Player of the Match for his impactful bowling spell. He says that the win was a much needed one. Adds that the wickets he took were crucial. Adds that it was all about bowling in the right areas and that went well. Says that everything went perfect for him. Ends by saying that they will look to carry on with the momentum and try to win the next game.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw the Los Angeles Knight Riders batters struggling against MI New York. Trent Boult, Nosthush Kenjige, and Rashid Khan got wickets and put the Knight Riders in a tough spot. However, a late boost by Andre Russell took them to a competitive total and gave some relief to their bowlers.\n\nNicholas Pooran says that he is happy with the win and they believed. Adds that they have been in similar situations before and they did well. He says that Kieron Pollard played the role of finisher well and he has all the experience. Ends by saying that they will give their best in the playoffs.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders executed their plan well. The pacers troubled the batters initially and Spencer Johnson gave them the opening wicket. Corne Dry soon followed and cleared the path for the rest of the bowlers. Sunil Narine and Andre Russell put further pressure with quick wickets. Johnson was shown a glimpse of vintage Pollard and that over, changed the momentum of the game. Ali Khan got rid of Pooran but the damage was already done. They couldn't make the cut this year but will hope to make a strong comeback next year.\n\nMI New York had a struggling start to their innings. They had to chase down the target in 18.2 over to qualify and Ruben Clinton couldn’t get going. He succumbed under pressure and so did Dewald Brevis. Nicholas Pooran couldn’t find an ideal partner to attack from both ends as Monank Patel, Heath Richards, and Romario Shepherd also crumbled under pressure. Kieron Pollard was at his best and he hit three sixes in Spencer Johnson’s one over to get his team right back in the game. In the end, Rashid Khan and Kieron Pollard sealed the game in their favor. The defending champions will once again have the chance to compete for the coveted trophy.\n\nMI NEW YORK HAVE MANAGED TO QUALIFY FOR THE PLAYOFFS! After a struggling run so far, the team in blue have made the cut when it mattered the most. The Los Angeles Knight Riders will have to try again next year as the top 4 are sealed in now.\n\n4\n\nOvers16.6\n\nScore134 - 6\n\nCorne Dry to Rashid Khan, FOUR! MI New York have qualified for the play-offs! On a length and on the pads. Rashid Khan gets a faint edge on it and the ball races away to the fine leg fence for a boundary.\n\n0\n\nOvers16.1\n\nScore128 - 6\n\nCorne Dry to Kieron Pollard, Short and on off, Kieron Pollard slaps it back towards the bowler who just manages to get t his right hand to it and drops it. A difficult chance though.\n\nTime Out! MI New York have lost Nicholas Pooran here but it won't matter much. They just need 5 runs off 16 balls to qualify for the playoffs. Rashid Khan comes on the crease now.\n\nW\n\nOvers15.4\n\nScore126 - 6\n\nAli Khan to Nicholas Pooran, OUT! LBW! The finger goes up and Nicholas Pooran refers again. Length and on middle, Nicholas Pooran looks to slog it but misses and the ball hits his pads. A loud appeal and the finger goes up. Nicholas Pooran refers.

Lands it outside off, Romario Shepherd looks to play a reverse sweep but gets a top edge. The ball lobs towards Andre Russell at short fine. He takes an easy catch.\n\nW\n\nOvers12.1\n\nScore78 - 4\n\nAndre Russell to Heath Richards, OUT! CAUGHT! Andre Russell strikes on his very first ball. On a length and on off, Heath Richards looks to loft it but the ball hits the upper part of his bat. It goes in the air towards long on. David Miller settles under it and takes a sitter.\n\n0\n\nOvers11.6\n\nScore78 - 3\n\nSunil Narine to Nicholas Pooran, Full and on middle. Nicholas Pooran blocks it out.

Pooran then anchored most of the chase with an innings of 35 for 28, before being caught LBW by Ali Khan.\n\nHowever, the finishing touch came from Pollard, who showcased his immense power by smashing three consecutive sixes off Spencer Johnson, effectively sealing the game.

The winner of this game will be occupy the only spot left in the top four.\n\nLAS vs NY: Team Previews\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nAfter a disastrous first season in MLC 2023, the LA Knight Riders made a good start to their campaign this season. However, the momentum dropped after the first game, and they started to fall behind the competition as they kept losing important games on the league stage.\n\nJust when the Sunil Narine-led side appeared done and dusted for this season, they staged a comeback with a win against the Seattle Orcas in their last outing. That win has brought them to a position where they just need to win their last match against MINY to make it into the top four.\n\nMI New York\n\nThe MI New York has had a similar run to MLC 2023. They have managed to win only out of their six games and are currently standing on the verge of elimination. However, in the first edition of the tournament, MI made a comeback from a similar stage and went on to become the maiden champions of the tournament.\n\nThe Kieron Pollard-led side needs to win this match against the Knight Riders by a significant margin to make it into the playoffs.\n\nLAS vs NY: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nLAS vs NY: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at the Grand Prairie Stadium has looked like a good batting track, especially in the first innings. With the progress of the game, the wicket has slowed down and has got the bowlers into the game. The spinners will play a big role in the game in the second innings, and as far as the pacers are concerned, those who bowl in the death and use their cutters and slowers with guile will be crucial.\n\nLAS vs NY: Probable Playing XIs\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Jason Roy, Sunil Narine (c), Unmukt Chand (wk), David Miller, Nitish Kumar, Saif Badar, Andre Russell, Corne Dry, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan, Waqar Salamkheil\n\nMI New York: Dewald Brevis, Ruben Clinton, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Kieron Pollard, Monank Patel, Romario Shepherd, Rashid Khan, Heath Richards, Sunny Patel, Noshthush Kenjige, Trent Boult\n\nLAS vs NY: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nLAS vs NY: Winner Prediction\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders have the better form and momentum and are the favourites to win the game. However, the toss will play a crucial role in the match and the team batting first will have an advantage in the game."

Facing the experienced Smith, Bravo bowls a slower delivery that proved a masterclass in deception.\n\nAnticipating a faster ball, Smith had committed himself early and moved significantly outside off stump. Bravo’s slower ball was expertly disguised and delivered with precision, skirting close to the stumps. Brought off balance by the change of pace, Smith attempted to swipe across the line but missed entirely, his shot falling well short of connecting.\n\nHowever, on the next delivery, he again used a subtle variation in pace and trajectory to induce an error from Smith. This time, Smith misjudged the ball and attempted a shot that resulted in a straightforward catch for Devon Conway behind the stumps. Smith’s innings ended at 57\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Nosthush Kenjige takes a spectacular catch to dismiss Finn Allen in MLC 2024\n\nFreedom batters shine\n\nAsked to bat first, Washington Freedom posted a strong total of 206/5 on the board. Openers Travis Head and Steve Smith provided a solid foundation with their fifties. Head smashed a quickfire 53, while Smith anchored the innings with a composed 57.\n\nTexas Super Kings were eventually bowled out for 164 in 19.5 overs, falling short of the target by a significant margin. Texas Super Kings’ chase faltered from the beginning. While Faf du Plessis (55) and Calvin Savage (35) offered some resistance, wickets fell regularly. Young spinner Noor Ahmad impressed with his control, taking 3-38, while the evergreen Bravo picked up 2-40 to keep the Texas batsmen in check.\n\nRachin Ravindra was the pick of the Washington Freedom bowlers, claiming 4-16 in a tidy spell. Jasdeep Singh also chipped in with three wickets.\n\nThis victory consolidates Washington Freedom’s position at the top of the MLC 2024 points table.

And right from that first season, we saw big sixes, high scores, electrifying fielding, and much more.\n\nWhile we’ve spoken about the top bowlers and batters in this league, we’re going to list down all Major League Cricket centuries on this page. Since it’s a global league with top T20 players signed from USA and around the world, you’ll find players from different countries being a part of the MLC centuries list. Keep reading for more details…\n\nThe first ever Major League Cricket century was scored by South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen, proving why he’s known as one of the best cricketers in the world in this format. And right after him a few days later, we saw another highly sought T20 batter in Nicholas Pooran who bagged himself an MLC century, doing so in the all-important MLC 2023 final.\n\nSEE ALSO: List of top online sports betting websites\n\nPost that, we saw a couple of more South African players (Faf du Plessis and Ryan Rickelton) getting MLC centuries and when we last updated this page, there were a total of four (4) centuries in this league.

Not only was it scored at a 250 strike rate but it came in an important final when his team was down initially. It’s also the highest score in MLC’s short history so far, getting 137* in just 55 deliveries.\n\nTill date, Seattle Orcas is the only franchise to have multiple entries in the MLC centuries list thanks to tons from Klaasen and Rickelton. A few teams are few to enter this list but considering there’s plenty of successful seasons to come over the years, we expect more entries in this list over the years.\n\nThree of the four centuries scored in this tournament have ended on a winning note while Faf’s centuries in MLC 2024 went in vain as the match was washed out due to rain after his century in the first innings.

In the last match, LA Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians New York locked horns in the 19th match. But After the match, Kieron Pollard’s kind gesture to a fan grabbed the limelight.\n\nMI New York Triumph over LA Knight Riders:\n\nOn the 19th match of the MLC 2024, MI New York and LA Knight Riders locked horns. After struggling in last few games, MI bounced back. In a crucial match for MI New York, their key players delivered to secure a spot in the MLC 2024 playoffs. Rashid Khan was outstanding with 3 wickets for 22 runs, limiting LAKR to 130 runs. MI New York chose to bowl first on a slow pitch, and Trent Boult made an early impact by dismissing Sunil Narine in his first over.\n\nThe dismissal of Unmukt Chand during the middle overs was crucial, given the importance of spin on the pitch. By the halfway point, LAKR struggled at 62 for 4. MI New York’s spinners combined for 5 wickets for 44 runs in eight overs, causing a collapse in the LAKR innings.\n\nMI New York’s chase started well with Dewald Brevis scoring 27 off 19 balls, hitting five boundaries. However, both he and opening partner Ruben Clinton were out by the end of the 36-run PowerPlay. Kieron Pollard then sealed the victory with a powerful performance, smashing Spencer Johnson for three consecutive sixes.\n\nPollard’s Heart-Winning Gesture:\n\nDuring the match, a ball hit a fan’s shoulder after Kieron Pollard hit a giant six. At the post-match presentation, Pollard inquired about the fan. Later, he met the fan, signed an autograph, and took a selfie with them. The video of this interaction went viral, winning the hearts of netizens.\n\nDefending champions MI New York clinched a spot in the Major League Cricket 2024 playoffs with a solid 4-wicket win over the LA Knight Riders. This victory has finalized the playoffs lineup, setting up an exciting Eliminator match against the Texas Super Kings. The game will take place at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday."

        "body": "In a thrilling encounter at the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) tournament, Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell lost his wicket to Afghanistan‘s Rashid Khan, trying a rash shot on a crucial game point. The match between Washington Freedom and MI New York saw Rashid’s guile and deception prove too much for the usually reliable Steve Smith and Maxwell.\n\nGlenn Maxwell’s aggression goes in vain\n\nMaxwell, known for his antics on the pitch, creative shots, and aggressive batting, has won many accolades with this style of play. However, Maxwell could not execute it in front of Rashid at that particular moment.\n\nAfghanistan’s legendary spinner delivered a masterclass in spin bowling, dismissing Washington Freedom’s skipper Smith and the destructive Maxwell. Bowling over the wicket, Rashid deceived Maxwell’s creative gameplay with a normal googly, which the Australian batter failed to read. The ball sneaked past Maxwell’s bat, crashing into the stumps and providing a crucial breakthrough for MI New York.\n\nHere’s the video\n\nMatch summary\n\nWashington Freedom secured a convincing 94-run victory over MI New York in their MLC encounter, booking their place in the playoffs. Batting first, Washington Freedom posted a challenging total of 182/5 in their 20 overs, with Travis Head and Andries Gous scoring half-centuries. Despite losing Maxwell to a brilliant delivery from Rashid, Rachin Ravindra’s late onslaught propelled Washington Freedom to a competitive score.\n\nIn reply, MI New York’s batting lineup crumbled under the pressure, with only two batters reaching double digits. Jasdeep Singh was the pick of the bowlers for Washington Freedom, claiming 3/14 with his pace. The other pacers, Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar, also made crucial contributions, taking two wickets each.\n\nAlso WATCH: Imad Wasim’s stunning one-handed catch dismisses Mukhtar Ahmed during SEO vs WAF in MLC 2024\n\nMI New York’s disappointing performance\n\nMI New York’s batting lineup failed to fire, with only two batters reaching double digits. The top six batters managed scores of 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, and 4, which is unacceptable in a T20 chase. The pitch had some assistance for the fast bowlers, and Washington Freedom’s pacers took full advantage of it.\n\nWashington Freedom’s all-round performance proved too much for MI New York, who struggled with both bat and ball. The victory secured Washington Freedom’s place in the playoffs and highlighted their potential to go all the way in the tournament."

Rachin Ravindra registered his best figures in T20 cricket with impressive stats of 4/16, while Jasdeep Singh finished with three wickets as we continued our unbeaten run this season. Earlier, Maxwell scored 34 off 23 balls to power us to 206/5.\n\nTravis Head smashed his third consecutive fifty to lead us to the highest total by any team in the MLC this season. Head amassed 53 off just 22 balls, hitting eight fours and two sixes. Meanwhile, our skipper Steve Smith scored 57 off 40 balls, including three sixes and two fours, to top-score in the contest.\n\nBatting first, Head got into the act quickly with two boundaries in the first over of the innings. The southpaw continued unabated, scoring five fours and a six in just 10 balls, reaching his fifty in only 20 balls.\n\nHead’s carnage pushed us to 74/2 at the end of the sixth over, equaling the second-highest powerplay score of MLC 2024. Although we lost three wickets in quick succession, Maxwell and Smith rebuilt our innings, adding 58 off 42 balls and taking us past the three-figure mark.\n\nMaxwell was severe on the spinners, hitting all his boundaries—three sixes and a four—against the slower bowlers. After a cautious start, Smith shifted gears effortlessly, reaching his first fifty of the MLC in style with a reverse hit for four.\n\nSmith, who was at 24 off 25 balls initially, smashed 33 runs off the next 14 balls before getting dismissed in the penultimate over. Obus Pienaar provided the finishing touches, scoring an unbeaten 21-ball 33 to take us past 200. Noor Ahmad picked up 3/38 for Texas Super Kings whereas Dwayne Bravo got two wickets.\n\nIn response, Maxwell once again provided the crucial breakthrough dismissing Devon Conway. However, TSK raced to 76/1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nBut we bounced back, picking up four wickets and conceding just 29 runs in the next six overs. Player of the Match Jasdeep dismissed TSK skipper du Plessis, who was looking in good nick, immediately after his fifty, to tilt the odds heavily in our favour.\n\nOnce Marcus Stoinis holed out in the deep to be Jasdeep’s third victim, there was no looking back as we romped home for our fifth victory of the season. Jasdeep recorded figures of 3/25 to round off a clinical bowling display.\n\nWith 11 points from six matches, we continue to be on top of the MLC 2024 points table.\n\nWe are up against the San Francisco Unicorns in our last league match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday.\n\nWashington Freedom vs Texas Super Kings MLC 2024 brief scores: WF 206/5 in 20 overs (Steve Smith 57, Travis Head 53, Noor Ahmad 3/38, Dwayne Bravo 2/40) vs TSK 164/10 in 19.5 overs (Faf du Plessis 55, Calvin Savage 35, Rachin Ravindra 4/16, Jasdeep Singh 3/25).\n\nWashington Freedom won by 42 runs."

        "body": "Washington Freedom will look to gain a psychological edge over the San Francisco Unicorns in their last league game of the Major League Cricket 2024 season at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday.\n\nOur match against SFU on July 22, a dress rehearsal for the Qualifier of MLC 2024, is scheduled to start at 7:30 PM CT (July 23, 6:00 AM IST). The MLC 2024 game will be available to watch via live streaming and broadcast.\n\nWith a comprehensive 42-run win over the Texas Super Kings, our unbeaten run in MLC 2024 continued. We are on top of the points table with 11 points from six games.\n\nTravis Head and Steve Smith came up with contrasting half-centuries, while Rachin Ravindra picked up four wickets, and Glenn Maxwell and Jasdeep Singh each got three in an all-round performance against TSK.\n\nDespite missing the last two matches for us, Netravalkar continues to top the bowling charts in MLC 2024 with 12 wickets from just four matches at an average of 9.16 runs and an astonishing strike rate of 7.66.\n\nMeanwhile, Travis Head and captain Steve Smith continue their run in the top-five batters list this season.\n\nHead has amassed 194 runs from six matches at an average of 38.80 and an impressive strike rate of 179.62 to be third on the overall list, whereas Smith is one run below at fourth with 191 runs. He has an unbelievable average of 63.66, the highest for any player this season, and a strike rate of 136.42.\n\nWF vs SFU form in MLC\n\nComing into this contest, we are unbeaten in our last five matches in the MLC, winning four of them, with one game washed off due to rain. We beat the San Francisco Unicorns by 30 runs in Morrisville in the 2023 season in our only meeting against them to date.\n\nWashington Freedom's last five matches\n\nOpponent\n\nVenue\n\nResult\n\nMatch Date\n\nMargin\n\nTSK\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 19, 2024\n\n42 runs\n\nMINY\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\n94 runs\n\nLAKR\n\nMorrisville\n\nWon\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\n8 wickets\n\nSO\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\n5 wickets\n\nTSK\n\nMorrisville\n\nNo Result\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\n-\n\nWF vs SFU, MLC 2024: Players to watch out\n\nHead and Smith once again provided us with an excellent start against the Texas Super Kings in the last match to power the team to the highest total in MLC 2024.\n\nHead scored his third consecutive fifty off just 20 balls, the fastest this season, to take us to the best powerplay score by any team this season. However, Faf du Plessis and TSK rewrote both records during the chase. Head also has the most fifties by any player this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Smith endured a slow start to go big in the later stage guiding the team to its first 200-plus total in MLC. He also scored his first half-century in the process.\n\nJasdeep Singh won the Player of the Match for a second straight match with an impressive three-wicket haul. He was reintroduced into the attack after the powerplay when TSK were flying high.\n\nJasdeep brought us back into the match with a spell of 3/17 in his last three overs, including the wickets of the dangerous du Plessis and Aaron Hardy. Apart from Jasdeep, Rachin Ravindra recorded career-best T20 bowling figures picking up 4/16 and Glenn Maxwell also chipped in with three wickets.\n\nComing to our match against San Francisco Unicorns last season, Netravalkar won the match single-handedly for us with his splendid spell of fast bowling. The left-arm pacer picked up a career-best 6/9 to skittle out SFU for 103 in response to our 133/8 batting first. This is also the best bowling performance in the MLC to date.\n\nWashington Freedom squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs SFU MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nLIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns match will be available on Monumental Sports Network and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA.

This game gets underway at 20:30 local time on Sunday 21st July 2024.\n\nLAKR vs MINY, Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch in Dallas seems to be getting quicker with batters having more success on it. A par first innings total looks like being in the region of 180-190.\n\nRead on for team previews, betting tips, latest odds, and match prediction for Los Angeles Knight Riders vs MI New York, Major League Cricket 2024\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Team News & Playing 11\n\nLAKR Team News\n\nThe Knight Riders ended their long wait for a second win in this campaign with a four wicket victory with five balls remaining against bottom of the table Seattle Orcas in their last game. They now play next to bottom of the table MI New York in this clash.\n\nLAKR Team Batting\n\nKeeper-batter Unmukt Chand was the star with the bat for Los Angeles Knight Riders as they successfully chased down 143 to beat MI New York. However, only Jason Roy also got to 20 and with David Miller along with Sunil Narine also in the top four, the Knight Riders will be looking for a stronger team batting display.\n\nLAKR Team Bowling\n\nAli Khan and Waqar Salamkheil were the only two of Los Angeles Knight Riders’ six man bowling unit to go wicketless in the last match and Salamkheil was very expensive. However, they are both talented players and will look to the experienced pair of Sunil Narine and Andre Russell for tips ahead of this clash.\n\nLAKR Team Form\n\nIt was four matches without a victory before Los Angeles Knight Riders’ win in their last game.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Predicted Playing 11\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine (c), Unmukt Chand (wk), David Miller, Nitish Kumar, Saif Badar, Andre Russell, Corne Dry, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan, Waqar Salamkheil\n\nMI New York Team News & Playing 11\n\nMINY Team News\n\nWith only Seattle Orcas below them in the table, and only a one point cushion above them, it has been a desperately disappointing tournament for MI New York and they lost their last game by three runs against San Francisco Unicorns on Thursday.\n\nMINY Team Batting\n\nSouth African Dewald Brevis struck a quick-fire and impressive 56 runs from 36 balls in the last game and he made an exciting 77 for the second wicket with Nicholas Pooran. Captain Pooran has not been in the greatest form but his side need him to be at his best in this game if they are to progress up the table.\n\nMINY Team Bowling\n\nThere is no doubt that MI New York have a strong bowling attack and in spinner Rashid Khan along with left-arm opening bowler Trent Boult they have two of T20s all time best bowlers. Nosthush Kenjige comes into this game after an excellent performance with the ball in Dallas in Match 16.\n\nMINY Team Form\n\nMI New York have not won any of their last five matches in the 2024 MLC.\n\nMI New York Predicted Playing 11\n\nDewald Brevis, Ruben Clinton, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Kieron Pollard (c), Monank Patel, Romario Shepherd, Rashid Khan, Heath Richards, Sunny Patel, Nosthush Kenjige, Trent Boult"
