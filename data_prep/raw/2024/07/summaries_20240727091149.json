This shot was a much-needed relief for the Super Kings, who were struggling against the Orcas' bowling attack.\n\n**Texas Super Kings' Struggle:** The Super Kings faced trouble on the field, collapsing to 12/2 by the end of the second over. Despite Faf du Plessis' efforts to stabilize the innings, wickets continued to fall, leaving the team in disarray.\n\n**Mitchell Santner's Impact:** Santner's knock was the only bright spark for the Super Kings, showcasing his composure and accuracy. His ability to embody the spirit of Suresh Raina, a Super Kings' legend, established his worth within the lineup and provided a rare moment of excitement in an otherwise struggling innings.\n\n**Significance:** Although the match result did not significantly impact the teams' positions, Santner's innings highlighted the best virtues of the Texas Super Kings and provided a memorable moment in the tournament."
