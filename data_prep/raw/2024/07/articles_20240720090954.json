        "date": "Fri Jul 19 10:24:29 2024",
        "body": "During a Major League Cricket match, fast-bowler Carmi le Roux suffered a frightening incident when he was struck in the head by a powerful shot from batter Ryan Rickelton. As le Roux was bowling his second over for the San Francisco Unicorns, a powerful shot from Seattle Orcas batter Rickelton caught the bowler by surprise and slammed directly into his head.\n\nThe vicious impact left le Roux’s face covered in blood, but remarkably the bowler remained conscious and walked off the field unassisted.\n\nIn the third over, South African bowler Le Roux was struck in the head by a powerful shot from his compatriot Rickelton. The southpaw, had intended to play the ball straight, but the shot ended up going directly towards the bowler.\n\nFortunately, le Roux was able to walk off the field under his own power, much to the relief of the medical staff and spectators.\n\nWith le Roux unavailable, former New Zealand and current USA all-rounder Corey Anderson stepped in to complete the over as the San Francisco Unicorns defended their total of 165 against the Seattle Orcas. Despite le Roux’s absence, the Unicorns were able to restrict the Orcas to just 142 runs.\n\nVeteran England pacer Liam Plunkett delivered an impressive performance, claiming 3/26 in his 4-over spell to emerge as the standout bowler.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas’ misfortunes continued as they suffered another defeat, this time to the Los Angeles Knight Riders, just two days after their previous loss. The back-to-back defeats have left the Orcas languishing at the bottom of the Major League Cricket (MLC) season two table – a stark contrast to their table-topping performance in the previous season.\n\nThe Orcas have only managed one win in their last five matches, putting them in a precarious position. Defending champions MI New York are also struggling, sitting fifth in the standings and outside of the playoff positions."

        "body": "Washington Freedom continued their winning streak, securing a 42-run victory over the Texas Super Kings to remain at the top of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket points table.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nTexas Super Kings 164/10 (19.5 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom 206/5 (20 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom won by 42 runs.\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas witnessed a dominant performance, as Rachin Ravindra’s four wickets bowled out the Texan team for 164 runs. However, led by Faf du Plessis’ quickfire half-century – the fastest by a batter this season -- the Texas Super Kings had a strong start to their run-chase.\n\nDu Plessis propelled his team to 76 runs in the powerplay. However, Washington's bowlers executed a brilliant comeback in the middle overs. Jasdeep Singh, Glenn Maxwell, and Ravindra shared the 10 wickets among them, but it was Lockie Ferguson's crucial over to Du Plessis after the powerplay that turned the tide. Lockie conceded only 2 wides in that over, eventually leading to Faf's dismissal.\n\nSoon after, the Super Kings' batting lineup crumbled, losing 4 wickets for just 15 runs between overs 7.1 and 11.6, ultimately costing them the match. While Calvin Savage managed to strike a few powerful blows towards the end, it only served to narrow the margin of defeat.\n\nEarlier in the clash, Washington Freedom posted a formidable target of 206 for the Texas Super Kings. The fireworks began early with Travis Head delivering a scintillating performance in the powerplay. He hammered 53 runs off just 22 balls, dismantling the seamers with ease and giving Washington a flying start.\n\nAs spin was introduced, the scoring rate slowed slightly, thanks to some purchase on the used pitch. However, Maxwell played a pivotal role in maintaining the momentum, contributing crucial runs in the middle overs. Towards the tail end of the innings, Pienaar provided a valuable boost, ensuring a strong finish for the team.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Smith (57) also continued his consistent performances, nearly batting through the entire innings and securing a well-earned fifty. His steady presence at the crease anchored the Washington innings and kept the scoreboard ticking.\n\nThe start given by the two Australian batters was more than enough for the middle order of the Washington-based side to take on the rest of the bowlers. Maxwell (34) and Obus Pienaar (33) both scored crucial runs to ensure their team put up a tough target that the Texas Super Kings were eventually unable to chase down.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-59 (Travis Head - 4.3 ov), 2-74 (Andries Gous - 5.6 ov), 3-79 (Rachin Ravindra - 6.5 ov), 4-137 (Glenn Maxwell - 13.5 ov), 5-186 (Steven Smith - 18.5 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-37 (Devon Conway - 3.3 ov), 2-90 (Aaron Hardie - 7.1 ov), 3-96 (Joshua Tromp - 9.4 ov), 4-98 (Faf du Plessis - 10.5 ov), 5-105 (Milind Kumar - 11.6 ov), 6-132 (Marcus Stoinis - 14.6 ov), 7-141 (Dwayne Bravo - 15.5 ov), 8-161 (Mohammad Mohsin - 17.5 ov), 9-163 (Noor Ahmad - 19.3 ov), 10-164 (Calvin Savage - 19.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nNoor Ahmad\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nTravis Head\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nAmila Aponso\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nJasdeep Singh\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Saturday, July 20, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas"

The partnership was indeed, a hilarious one, as Travis Head scored 53 runs out of those 59 runs, whereas, Steve Smith faced merely 5 balls, and scored 4 runs.\n\nTexas Super Kings made a mini-comeback of their own, as Travis Head's departure was followed by quick dismissals of Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra inside the next 20 runs, ad Washington Freedom were reeling at 79/3 in 7 overs.\n\nThe small stutter did not halt the scoring rate, as the Australian duo of Glenn Maxwell and Steve Smith notched up a 58-run stand to resurrect the innings before Glenn Maxwell departed on the score of 138. Steve Smith held his guard until the last phase of the innings, as his excellent half-century enabled the Freedom to cross the 200-run mark.\n\nIn reply, the in-form Faf Du Plessis announced his arrival on the pitch in some style, as the Proteas legend unleashed his wrath on Washington Freedom bowlers, and TSK were 76/1 at the end of the powerplay. What followed later was a downhill journey for the side, as wickets fell in quick succession and intervals, and the target of 207 seemed even more improbable.\n\nThe Faf Du Plessis-led side bundled out for 164, as four wickets from Rachin Ravindra, and three wickets each from Glenn Maxwell and Jasdeep Singh saw Washington Freedom home in a winning cause."

Despite a shaky start, Anderson's composure helped his team post a competitive total of 148/7. Hassan Khan's valuable 44 complemented Anderson's effort, particularly their crucial 87-run partnership which salvaged the innings after early setbacks.\n\nThe Unicorns' innings began poorly, with Noshtush Kenjige wreaking havoc by dismissing Finn Allen (0) and Matthew Short (4) early on. Further losses of Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis left the team struggling at 28/4 by the end of the powerplay.\n\nSherfane Rutherford's brief 15 gave some momentum before being run out. Rashid Khan's dismissal of Hassan Khan in the 17th over and Trent Boult's double strikes kept MI New York in contention. However, Anderson's steady half-century ensured the Unicorns had a defensible score.\n\nIn response, MI New York's chase had a turbulent start as Matthew Short claimed the wicket of Ruben Clinton (0) in the second over. Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran then steadied the ship, taking MI New York to 31/1 at the end of the powerplay. Brevis was particularly impressive, reaching his half-century in just 32 balls with an aggressive display against Pat Cummins.\n\nDespite Brevis' heroics, MI New York's middle order crumbled under pressure. Brody Couch's twin strikes to remove Brevis and captain Kieron Pollard (4) shifted the momentum. Matthew Short further dented MI New York's chase by dismissing Pooran (26).\n\nAs the run rate escalated, Romario Shepherd and Monank Patel fell cheaply, leaving Rashid Khan and Heath Richards with a daunting task. Cummins' tight 19th over, conceding just five runs, was instrumental in tightening the screws.\n\nThe final over, bowled by Haris Rauf, saw a valiant effort from Heath Richards, who nearly pulled off a miraculous chase by hitting two sixes. However, his dismissal on the last ball sealed a dramatic win for the Unicorns.\n\nThe thrilling contest showcased exceptional performances on both sides but ultimately highlighted the importance of composure under pressure. Corey Anderson's stability with the bat and Pat Cummins' crucial bowling proved decisive in a match that kept spectators on the edge of their seats until the final delivery.\n\nBrief Scores\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns 148/7 (Corey Anderson 59*, Hassan Khan 44; Noshtush Kenjige 2/13, Trent Boult 2/35) beat MI New York 145/7 (Dewald Brevis 56, Nicholas Pooran 26; Matthew Short 3/27, Brody Couch 2/27)"

This shot was significant as it came during a crucial phase of the match when New York needed to accelerate their scoring during the powerplay overs. Brevis, known for his aggressive batting, targeted the third over of the inning where, on the second ball, the right-handed batter picking up the length quickly rocks on the back foot and timed the shot perfectly against Short. The ball, slightly short in length, came onto Brevis’ bat, and he smashed the ball with his might towards long-on, soaring over the boundary for six runs.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Shehan Jayasuriya hits an unorthodox shot against Haris Rauf in MLC 2024\n\nMatch Summary\n\nEarlier, the Unicorns batted first, scoring 148 runs for seven wickets in their 20 overs.

The match, held between MI New York and San Francisco Unicorns, saw Kenjige make a significant impact right from the start.\n\nNosthush Kenjige’s breathtaking catch\n\nOn the third ball of the first over, Kenjige delivered a short-length delivery directed towards the wicket. Allen, opting for a backfoot shot, attempted to muscle the ball down the ground. However, he failed to generate the necessary power and elevation, and the ball dribbled straight back toward the bowler. Demonstrating exceptional agility and presence of mind, Kenjige stretched out to his right and made a spectacular catch, sending Allen back to the pavilion for just 2 runs. This stunning catch not only highlighted Kenjige’s skill as a bowler but also showcased his impressive fielding abilities.\n\nKenjige’s performance didn’t stop there. He was instrumental in dismissing both opening batters of the San Francisco Unicorns, taking the wicket of Matthew Short along with Allen. Over his four overs, Kenjige maintained an impressive economy rate of 3.20, conceding only 13 runs and securing 2 wickets.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Shehan Jayasuriya hits an unorthodox shot against Haris Rauf in MLC 2024\n\nDespite the exceptional efforts of Kenjige and the MI New York bowlers, the team fell short in their chase.

They will be relishing the chance to lockhorns with the Orcas again who they beat by 23 runs only five days before this fixture.\n\nSFU Team Batting\n\nEven with their top four batters producing just eight runs and seeing the team struggle on 19/4 in the last game, San Francisco Unicorns showed that they have depth in their batting order by going onto win that match. In this fixture, Seattle Orcas will know there is batting ability all the way through the side.\n\nSFU Team Bowling\n\nWith the ball, Brody Couch and Matthew Short opened the bowling in their win over MI New York and took five wickets between them.

With Glenn Maxwell at number four and Rachin Ravindra at number five, Texas Super Kings’ bowlers are likely to get no rest from big hitters in this match.\n\nWAF Team Bowling\n\nDefending a target of 183 in their last fixture, Washington Freedom showed that their bowling attack is just as strong as their batting unit as they dismissed MI New York for 88 inside 14 overs. South African Marco Jansen and Jasdeep Singh will take the new ball in this game.\n\nWAF Team Form\n\nWashington Freedom are still yet to experience defeat in the tournament and have won four of their five matches.\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted Playing 11\n\nTravis Head, Steven Smith (c), Andries Gous (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Ian Holland, Lockie Ferguson, Jasdeep Singh"

        "body": "The stage is set for a crucial encounter in the Major League Cricket 2024 as the San Francisco Unicorns lock horns with the Seattle Orcas in the 13th T20 match. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide who might emerge victorious:\n\nUnicorns with a Slight Edge\n\nWhile both teams haven’t exactly set the tournament on fire, the Unicorns (currently ranked 4th) appear to have a slight advantage over the struggling Orcas (anchored at the bottom). Here’s why:\n\nRecent Form: The Unicorns might have only one win in three matches, but their Net Run Rate (-0.631) is significantly better than the Orcas’ (-1.007). This indicates closer contests for the Unicorns.\n\nBatting Power: Players like Finn Allen, Corey Anderson, and Sherfane Rutherford in the Unicorns’ batting line-up pose a serious threat, especially early on.\n\nOrcas Can’t be Counted Out\n\nHowever, writing off the Orcas would be a mistake. Here’s why they might pull off an upset:\n\nHome Advantage: The match takes place at Church Street Park, Morrisville, which could potentially favor the Orcas if they’re familiar with the pitch conditions.\n\nBowling X-Factor: The likes of Nauman Anwar, Harmeet Singh, and Zaman Khan in the Orcas’ bowling attack have the potential to disrupt the Unicorns’ batting rhythm.\n\nMatch Prediction\n\nWhile the Unicorns seem to have a slight edge on paper, expect a close encounter. The final result might hinge on individual brilliance and handling pressure situations. Cricketwebs predicts a narrow victory for the Unicorns (winning probability: 69%), but the Orcas have the potential to cause an upset.\n\nWinner: San Francisco Unicorns Will Win\n\nRemember: Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties. Enjoy the match!"
