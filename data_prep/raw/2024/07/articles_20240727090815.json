        "body": "In a nail-biting encounter at the Grand Prairie Stadium, San Francisco Unicorns edged out the Texas Super Kings by 10 runs in the penultimate match of the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) season to book a title clash with the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe San Franciso Unicorns posted a challenging total of 200/6, thanks to a vital innings from Finn Allen (101 in 53 balls, with nine fours and five sixes) that set the stage for a thrilling chase where the Texas Super Kings fell just short at 190/4. Following the day’s result, the Texas Super Kings will take on the Washington Freedom on Sunday, as per a press release from MLC.\n\nFinn Allen’s explosive 101 off 53, including nine boundaries and five sixes, set the tone for the Unicorns. Allen’s aggressive play during the powerplay provided the Unicorns with the momentum they needed, bringing them to a powerplay score of 66/0. Despite Noor Ahmed’s quick wickets of Jake Fraser ‘McGurk (18) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (0), Josh Inglis added a crucial 37 from 25 deliveries to support Allen through the innings. Fin Allen’s exploits included a 16 run over of Marcus Stoinis on two occasions, the second and the 13th over, and an 18 run over of Zia Ul Haq, comprising two consecutive sixes.\n\nHassan Khan’s quick 27 off 15 balls, with four boundaries and a six, was also vital in propelling the Unicorns to the 200-run mark. For the Texas Super Kings, Noor Ahmad was the standout bowler, capturing key wickets and finishing with figures of 3/27.\n\nIn response, the Texas Super Kings opened strong, with Devon Conway (62* in 38 balls, with seven fours and a six) leading the pursuit. Faf du Plessis contributed a brisk 45 off 22, with seven fours and a six, but his dismissal derailed the Texas Super Kings’ momentum following a 55-run opening stand. While middle-order contributions from Aaron Hardie (19), Milind Kumar (2) and Marcus Stoinis (1) were lacking, Joshua Tromp, scored a breezy 56 from 36 balls, and kept the Super Kings in the hunt until the final over.\n\nConway brought up his half century in only 30 balls, whereas Tromp powered his way to the milestone in 31 deliveries, including four fours and two sixes.\n\nThe match came down to the wire in the last five overs, with the Texas Super Kings needing 64 runs. With the dangerous Conway and Tromp at the crease, Haris Rauf and Pat Cummins held their nerves for the San Franciso Unicorns, delivering tight overs under pressure. Cummins was pivotal in the 20th over, conceding only 7 runs when 18 were needed, showcasing experienced death bowling that ensured a Unicorns’ victory. Juanoy Drysdale emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the innings with figures of 2/33.\n\nBrief Scores: San Francisco Unicorns: 200/6 in 20 overs (Finn Allen 101, Josh Inglis 37, Noor Ahmad 3/27) Texas Super Kings: 190/4 in 20 overs (Devon Conway 62*, Joshua Tromp 56, Juanoy Drysdale 2/33).

        "body": "Right then, that is it from the qualifier game of the Major League Cricket between San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom. It is Washingtom Freedom that have sealed their spot in the finals while the San Francisco will have another chance to make it there. The Challenger game will be played on the 27th of July 2024 at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT) where the Unicorns will face the Texas Super Kings. Our coverage will start an hour earlier so make sure to tune in for an exciting mactch. Until then, goodbye and cheers!\n\nSteven Smith, the captain of Washington Freedom says that captaincy has been fun and the team works as a unit. Says that it has been a good campaign and appreciates his team for playing well. Mentions that he wanted wickets with the new ball to make it easier towards the later stages. Credits Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell for playing well. Adds that Head is confident and tries to hit every ball and targets all the pockets of the ground which works for him.\n\nCorey Anderson, the captain of San Francisco Unicorns says that losing 4 wickets in the first innings was tough and that they were 20-30 runs short. Feels that they weren’t up to the mark throughout the game. Says that the batters need to take risks and they will bounce back stronger.\n\nTravis Head is the Player of the Match for his scintillating knock. He says that batting in the Powerplay is fun for him. Adds that he tries to get that fast start and that is his role in the team. Mentions that the wicket here is good and the swing on offer here allows him to play some good shots. Says that the team has full faith in him and has given him free air to do his thing.\n\nRachin Ravindra is up for a chat. He says that he is happy with his bowling and it was a good day for them. Mentions that it is all about execution and is happy to fulfill the role of the backup bowler. Adds that he aims to be a genuine all rounder and help the teams that he is a part of. Says that he tries to soak it as much as he can and learn from the senior players and coaches. Feels that he is adjusting to the role and learns from every experience.\n\nEarlier in the match, Washington Freedom won the toss and opted to have San Francisco bat first. The innings began with Marco Jansen claiming an early wicket, dismissing Finn Allen cheaply. Jake Fraser-McGurk followed suit, falling to Saurabh Netravalkar without scoring. Wickets kept on tumbling for them until Hassan Khan and Anderson joined hands. Hassan Khan played a commendable innings, scoring 57 runs, supported by Corey Anderson's 26 off 19, as they added 61 runs for the 6th wicket from just 35 balls. Once Anderson departed, the things kept falling apart for them. Rachin Ravindra was the standout bowler for the Washington Freedom with remarkable figures of 4 wickets for just 11 runs. Marco Jansen took three wickets but was expensive, while Saurabh Netravalkar ended up with 2 wickets in his kitty.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns would have wanted a few more runs on the board in the first innings but Pat Cummins gave them a great start with the wicket of Steven Smith. Hassan Khan then worked his spin magic and sent Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra back in consecutive overs. After that, the bowlers just gave away some loose deliveries and got themselves under pressure. The poor overs by Haris Rauf and Corey Anderson didn't help their cause and they failed to break the partnership. In the end, the total was a bit low to defend. However, they will still have one more chance in the Challenger to give themselves a ticket to the finals.\n\nWashington Freedom have beaten San Francisco Unicorns very confidently and established themselves in the finals directly! They had a shaky start with the early dismissal of Steven Smith and the initial struggle by Travis Head. However, Andries Gous came in to play a few shots while Travis Head too found his rhythm. His onslaught combined with Glenn Maxwell's power hitting gave the boost needed to this team. The positive intent got the opposition under pressure and sealed the game in their favor.\n\n6\n\nOvers14.4\n\nScore134 - 3\n\nHassan Khan to Glenn Maxwell, SIX! DISPATCHED! Too full and outside off. Glenn Maxwell fetches it from outside off and sends it flying over the long on fence for the second one of the over.\n\n1\n\nOvers13.4\n\nScore118 - 3\n\nCorey Anderson to Travis Head, BRILLIANT EFFORT! On a length and outside off. Travis Head reaches for it and carves it aerially towards deep point. Sherfane Rutherford runs in and collects it. The umpires want to have a check upstairs. The replays show that the ball has touched the ground and hence it has been given NOT OUT! The batters run a single.\n\n4\n\nOvers13.2\n\nScore113 - 3\n\nCorey Anderson to Travis Head, FOUR! EDGED AGAIN! On the hard length and outside off. Travis Head throws his bat at it and the ball flies over short third this time. The ball again, meets the ropes for four more.\n\n4\n\nOvers12.6\n\nScore105 - 3\n\nPat Cummins to Glenn Maxwell, FOUR! LOVELY! Slow and on a length outside off. Glenn Maxwell just opens up his blade and guides it past backward point. The ball races off to the fence for four runs to end the over.\n\n4\n\nOvers11.1\n\nScore86 - 3\n\nJuanoy Drysdale to Travis Head, FOUR! THE ATTACK IS ON! Full and outside off. Travis Head gets low and carves it past point. The ball races off to the fence for four runs to begin the over.\n\n6\n\nOvers10.6\n\nScore82 - 3\n\nHassan Khan to Glenn Maxwell, SIX! BANG BANG! Quicker now and on off. Glenn Maxwell slogs it with much power and timing to launch the ball into the stands behind long on for consecutive sixes. A good over by Hassan Khan was turned around in just a couple of deliveries.\n\n0\n\nOvers9.6\n\nScore69 - 3\n\nHaris Rauf to Glenn Maxwell, Short but angled into the batter. Glenn Maxwell slices it towards the fielder at point. A quiet couple of over for Washington Freedom, they might be hoping for some boundaries to come soon.\n\n1lb\n\nOvers9.4\n\nScore68 - 3\n\nHaris Rauf to Glenn Maxwell, Leg bye! Quick and on a length around leg. Glenn Maxwell is hit on the pads and the ball rockets towards Josh Inglis. Inglis tries to stop it but the ball hits the tip of his hand and rolls towards deep third. The batters cross for a leg bye and Inglis seems to be in some pain.\n\n1\n\nOvers9.1\n\nScore65 - 3\n\nHaris Rauf to Travis Head, FIFTY FOR TRAVIS HEAD! Full and on leg. Travis Head drives it to long on for a single. That is the fifth consecutive fifty for Travis Head."

        "body": "The stunning match of the American-based Major League Cricket (MLC) season was between the Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas. While there was not much at stake in terms of qualification to the playoffs until the last games, it was still important for the Super Kings to score a victory in the game. This was a major decision that saw the Seattle Orcas take the field before the Texas Super Kings, though this did not take long. The Super Kings faced a lot of trouble on the field, which resulted in the collapse of the team at one point, and by the end of the second over, they were down 12/2.\n\nWhile Faf du Plessis painstakingly tried to ensure a more sedate approach, wickets tumbled in a heap, and the Super Kings were in a state of disarray.\n\nMitchell Santner’s Heroic Moment For Texas Super Kings\n\nWhile the Texas Super Kings struggled against the rising pressure of Seattle Orca’s bowling attack, Kiwi all-rounder Mitchell Santner rose to the occasion. The fifth delivery of the 11th over saw Santner come up with a shot, which must have been a huge relief for his team, who seemed to be teetering at that stage. This particular shot reminded me a lot of one of the legends of the Super Kings, Suresh Raina.\n\nAli Sheikh, the Orcas’ spinner, bowled the ball up on off-stump, and there was no nonsense about Santner, who started showing immense composure and accuracy and played a wonderful inside-out against the spinner over long-off for a giant six. It could also be seen as a soft skill for the analysis, and the timing for this shot was reminiscent of Raina’s famous move. Raina was famous for playing spinner, and this shot was famous with him when he played for Super Kings, while Santner did this well as a mimic to Raina.\n\nA Tribute to Suresh Raina\n\nIt was not just a show of force, but it was all about Suresh Raina and his great contribution to the Indian cricket team. Raina, one of the superior strapping batsmen loved for his originality and hostility against spinners, was a part of the Super Kings’ legacy. Santner, in particular, mimicked Raina’s shot in the context of the match’s execution, where he went inside out to a spinner, thus giving the fans a memory to denote.\n\nOver the courtesy of some fine fast bowling from the Orcas, Santner’s knock was the only bright spark for the Super Kings as the match went on. His capacity to embody the spirit of one of the squad greats established his worth within the lineup, becoming a symbol of strength at the touchdown poker site amid the team’s misfortunes.\n\nWhile the result of the match was not decisive and seemingly did not change the position of the teams significantly, the moment when Mitchell Santner set for the ball and scored a long shot supported by Ali Sheikh was the moment that made cricket exciting and presented the essence of the Texas Super Kings. In such a lighter vein, as the Super Kings will turn their attention to the playoffs, Santner’s innings underlined the best virtues of this team."

        "body": "San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) all-rounder Corey Anderson showcased his brilliant fielding during the match against the Texas Super Kings (TSK) in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. Corey Anderson took a sensational catch to get rid of Faf du Plessis in the Challenger match of the ongoing T20 tournament.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns posted a formidable 200/6 in 20 overs against the Texas Super Kings. The knockout match took place at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Saturday, July 27 (IST). Opener Finn Allen scored an impressive century of 101 runs off 53 balls with the help of nine boundaries and five maximums.\n\nJosh Inglis scored 37 runs from 25 balls, and Hassan Khan added 27 off 15 balls. Left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad was the standout bowler for the Super Kings, claiming three wickets for 27 runs. The Faf du Plessis-led team needed to chase down the target to reach the final match of the Major League Cricket.\n\nWatch: Corey Anderson Takes Sensational Catch To Dismiss Faf du Plessis\n\nFaf du Plessis and Devon Conway provided a flying start for the team as they added 50 runs in just 4 overs. Du Plessis scored 45 runs off 22 deliveries, including seven boundaries and one six. However, the TSK skipper's innings ended with a spectacular one-handed catch by Corey Anderson during the fifth over.\n\nThe right-handed batter mistimed a shot off pacer Carmi le Roux. The former New Zealand all-rounder, who was positioned at mid-off, timed his jump perfectly to make a stunning catch with his left hand. The Super Kings lost their first wicket with 55 runs on the board in 4.2 overs during the recent MLC match.\n\nDevd Conway (62 off 38 balls) and Joshua Trump (56 off 36 balls) scored unbeaten half-centuries during the run chase. However, the Texas Super Kings lost the match by just 10 runs. Juanoy Drysdale picked up two wickets for 33 runs in his four overs, while Hassan Khan and Carmi le Roux each took one wicket.\n\nThat Catch Helped Us - Corey Anderson\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns skipper Corey Anderson stated that they managed to secure victory due to crucial moments, including Juanoy Drysdale’s performance and his spectacular catch. Anderson said that his catch of Faf du Plessis was pivotal in disrupting the Super Kings' momentum.\n\n\"I thought they kept going (TSK batters), but we kept hanging in and we had runs on the board. He was incredible tonight, won us the moments in the middle (on Drysdale), was a bit underdone coming into the tournament, but has got better with games. It was moments like that which will help us going further (on his one-handed catch), Faf has been playing well right through the tournament, so that catch helped us to stall some of the momentum away from them,\" Anderson said.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns will face the Washington Freedom in the final game at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday, July 29 (IST)."

        "date": "Fri Jul 26 14:32:06 2024",
        "body": "In a match that will be etched into Major League Cricket (MLC) folklore, Glenn Maxwell‘s colossal six propelled the Washington Freedom to a thrilling seven-wicket victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in Qualifier of the MLC 2024. Chasing a modest 146, Freedom were in trouble at 64/3 before Maxwell unleashed his power-hitting prowess to turn the game on its head.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have a stick\n\nBatting first, the San Francisco Unicorns posted a competitive total of 145 runs in their allotted 19 overs. Hassan Khan, the tournament’s standout bowler, once again showcased his talent with a quickfire 57. However, the Unicorns’ innings was derailed by a brilliant spell from Rachin Ravindra, who claimed four wickets for just 11 runs to stifle the Unicorns’ momentum. Marco Jansen also chipped in with three wickets as the Freedom bowlers kept a tight leash on the Unicorns’ batting.\n\nGlenn Maxwell’s masterclass\n\nWith the bat, Washington Freedom were off to a shaky start, losing their top three batters cheaply. The pressure was mounting on the Freedom, but then, Maxwell arrived at the crease. The Australian maverick wasted no time in asserting his dominance, launching into the Unicorns’ bowlers with reckless abandon.\n\nThe highlight of the innings, and perhaps the entire tournament so far, came when Maxwell deposited a Hassan delivery into orbit during the 15th over. The ball cleared the boundary with disdain, going a staggering 103 meters away. The crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium was left in awe as they witnessed a shot that will be replayed for years to come.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nMaxwell’s brutal hitting took the game away from the Unicorns. He raced to a fifty, providing the much-needed impetus to the Freedom chase. With Travis Head providing steady support, the duo ensured that Washington Freedom crossed the line with seven wickets in hand and three balls to spare.\n\nAlso WATCH: Pat Cummins dismisses Steve Smith on the very first ball of his spell in MLC 2024\n\nWashington Freedom advance to the Final\n\nThe victory propels Washington Freedom into the final of the MLC 2024. They will be brimming with confidence after Maxwell’s match-winning heroics. On the other hand, the San Francisco Unicorns will be disappointed to miss out on the final, but they can take solace from their impressive performance throughout the tournament.\n\nHassan, despite conceding the longest six of the tournament, has been a revelation and will undoubtedly be a key player for the Unicorns in the future. The final promises to be a blockbuster clash and cricket fans around the world will be eagerly anticipating the showdown between the two best teams in the tournament."

        "body": "Despite being 40, Faf du Plessis is the best batter in the Major League Cricket 2024. He was also brilliant in IPL 2024. There is no reason why he cannot play a few more years in the IPL. However, Royal Challengers Bengaluru may not retain him. He may not be worth the retention amount, especially because of his game. That said, a few other teams will target to sign him. On that note, here, we take a look at the list of two franchises which might target Faf du Plessis for IPL 2025 if he is released by RCB.\n\n1) Chennai Super Kings\n\nIt is for the Texas Super Kings that Faf du Plessis played so well in MLC 2024. He was decent for the Joburg Super Kings in SA20 2024. Considering his past success at CSK, it is not a surprise if CSK goes back for him again in the IPL 2025 Mega Auctions.\n\nAt the moment, CSK needs an opener who can make the best use of the powerplay. Both Faf and Devon Conway combined well for TSK in MLC 2024. CSK will look to have both of them back again in the side. Faf is a CSK legend and it is best that he gets his farewell at this franchise as per the fans of CSK. It needs to be seen if this could happen, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Punjab Kings\n\nPunjab Kings is one of the franchises which might target Faf du Plessis for IPL 2025 if he is released by RCB. It needs to be noted that Faf du Plessis is the skipper of St Lucia Kings in the CPL, a franchise which is also owned by the owners of Punjab Kings.\n\nPlus, Faf is in great form and would provide a captaincy choice straightaway. The home venue for PBKS might also suit Faf’s style although it might not be perfect for him. Under him, the franchise can adopt a better structure and streamline their progress."
