        "date": "Thu Jul 25 15:30:00 2024",
        "body": "When the first season of Major League Cricket came to a close, the Seattle Orcas showed their class. This year, the result was much different for the team of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSeattle fell in its final match of MLC 2 to the Texas Super Kings, losing by 37 runs.\n\nIt capped a horrid season for the green and gray, as the Orcas managed just two points and finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nSeattle is very South African heavy with its international players, who are coming off a world cup semifinal appearance. To say there were tired legs, would be stating the obvious. “Most of our pros came over straight from the world cup. Even if they won’t agree, they looked a little bit exhausted,” said Orcas All-Rounder Harmeet Singh.\n\nSome of the best South African cricketers have been playing without more than a week’s break for over four months.\n\nThis season just wasn’t to be for the Orcas. Like Seattle’s other bat-to-ball franchise, the Mariners, the Orcas could not put consistent runs on the board.\n\nOver the course of the seven games played this season, Seattle batted second in three of them and chased runs successfully in their lone victory. But when the Orcas were required to put up a high number, Seattle continuously dropped the ball.\n\nWhen opening with the batting, the Orcas have won just one game in their two years of existence. It was all the way back on July 15, 2023, in a win over San Fransisco. But since then, Seattle has lost seven in a row when opening with the paddle.\n\nDespite quite literally nothing bouncing the way of the Orcas in year two, in the final match there looked to be some positives. Ayan Desai made his MLC and Orcas debut taking the ball to start the first over.\n\nWith his first ball he took the wicket of a top-class cricketer in Devon Conway via leg before wicket. That ball was later named the play of the game and was the start of a great first match for Desai.\n\nHe finished with 2 wickets and 30 runs, and an economy of 7.50 which was the third lowest of all bowlers in the game.\n\nIt was just a bleak day with the bat for the Orcas after holding the Super Kings to a pretty manageable 177 after the first innings.\n\nSeattle knew it was going to have to work hard after its top run-scorer Ryan Rickleton was dismissed for a golden duck for the second straight match. Rickleton looked to be the bright spot of the Orca’s 2024 season scoring a century and spent a lot of time on the top of the run scoring table, but in his last two matches never saw a second ball.\n\nNo Orca scored more than 26 runs (Quentin de Kock 19 balls), which pales in comparison to the Super Kings’ three players who scored over 29 in the match.\n\nIt is a season to forget based on results for the Orcas, but MLC season 2 is a year to look back on as the sport of cricket continues to grow in the United States."

        "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nA place in the final of Major League Cricket in 2024 is at stake as league winners Washington Freedom take on second-place finishers San Francisco Unicorns in the qualifier.\n\nDATE & TIME: Thursday 25th July 2024 - USA ET – 8:30pm / USA PT – 5:30pm / West Indies – 7:30pm / Friday 26th July 2024 - UK – 1:30am / South Africa – 2:30am / Pakistan - 5:30am / India – 6:00am / Bangladesh – 6:30am / Australia – 10:30am\n\nVENUE: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, Texas, United States\n\nWEATHER: Dry with clear skies, a gentle breeze and temperatures of around 27c.\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – Sony Sports / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – TBA\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – discovery+ / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – Sony LIV / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia & New Zealand – Amazon Prime Video\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM FORM: GETTING BACK TO WINNING WAYS A PRORITY\n\nWashington Freedom come into the play-offs on the back of defeat, losing their unbeaten record in this tournament at the hands of the Unicorns. Although the result meant nothing in the grand scheme of things, Washington will hope for no psychological effects.\n\nLAST THREE: LWW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: WANTING TO AT LEAST FINISH ON A HIGH\n\nTo beat Washington Freedom earlier in the week and extending their winning run will have served this San Francisco Unicorns squad with a huge injection of confidence ahead of this qualifier, knowing they have the ability to beat their opponents here.\n\nLAST THREE: WWW\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nOpeners Travis Head and Steve Smith have combined for a total of 385 runs over the course of this tournament, with Head blasting 194 and Smith 191. The latter is averaging over 60 and such numbers cannot be ignored from a betting point of view. Back Smith to score over 30+ runs and also back the pair to add over 26.5 runs for the first Washington wicket.\n\nWhilst he is known mainly for his batting, Rachin Ravindra also provides a very handy spin option for the Freedom. Figures of 4/16 against Texas Super Kings is testament to that and any hint of turn at Grand Prairie Stadium will be taken advantage of by the New Zealand international. Therefore, look at backing Ravindra with a small stake to finish as Washington’s top bowler.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nA lot could depend on San Francisco opener Finn Allen in the qualifier as he possesses the power required to tip things in the Unicorn’s favour whether they be setting or chasing a target. Allen’s 186 runs, including 15 sixes have been paramount to his side’s success, so backing Allen to continue his big-hitting exploits and gain over 0.5 match sixes here is worth a play on.\n\nAlso worthy of attention on the batting front is Sanjay Krishnamurthi on the back of his 79 from just 42 balls in the last contest between these two sides. Having performed so well against the same opponent so recently, Krishnamurthi knows what he needs to do to accumulate a significant score again vs Washington and backing him to gain 20+ runs via the ‘Battle Milestones’ market should be considered.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERTPREDICTION\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns may have gotten the better of Washington Freedom when the two teams last collided, but you can be sure that a different Freedom will be on show this time around, with significantly more at stake. The bowling especially should be far tighter on the Washington side and San Francisco will surely not find it as easy to score on this occasion.\n\nExpect Washington to bounce back strongly and whilst their batters should get on top of the Unicorns, this time the Freedom bowlers will likely show a marked improvement and help lead the league stage table toppers to victory."

        "date": "Tue Jul 23 09:46:26 2024",
        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 is seeing a superb season for Australian cricketer Steve Smith, who was recently seen as the king of cricket grounds. Smith has not had a place in the Australian T20I team but showed his prowess with the bat again and became the talk of the town on Monday, July 22. Washington Freedom’s team leader provided bowling skills at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas against the San Francisco Unicorns, proving his unerring style even in the modern mode of the game.\n\nThe test specialist Steve Smith gave a rude reminder of that by cutting loose against the bowlers for 56 of 31 balls. He also set five boundaries and four maximums, two of which were stunning and caught the attention of MLC’s social media team. That flexibility alone was on display in the dressing-room speech, reminding everyone why he is widely considered one of cricket’s premier players of all time.\n\nGreat Figures in MLC 2024\n\nSince the start of the season, Steve Smith has proved to be one of the best players for the Washington Freedom. He has 247 runs to his credit in the seven games and has scored an average of 61.75. with a magnificent strike rate of 144.44. These figures put him in the position of the principal run-maker in the competition, a position next to Faf du Plessis, who has amassed 264 runs, and his teammate Travis Head, who has scored 250 runs.\n\nSmith and his valuable properties have played a significant role in the Washington Freedom’s campaign to attain and maintain a solid standing in leagues.\n\nThe Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns will face each other once more on Friday in the first semifinal of the tournament. Both teams qualified for the playoffs with five equal wins; therefore, the following match was expected. Even with the six-wicket loss to San Francisco in the recent match that adopted the DLS method in Washington’s first match defeat of the season, the side is fully optimistic, and Smith has a lot of trust in them.\n\nSteve Smith’s Journey and Revival in MLC\n\nWhat is perhaps even more powerful is that this journey in MLC 2024 has been told through the story of Smith. He has experienced some misfortune in the international T20 chase, and then this spec allows him to reintroduce himself. This characteristic has been a boost to Washington Freedom because he can stabilize the innings and yet be very aggressive when the game calls for it. This season, Steve Smith has not only shown good technique but also the good strategies that you expect from a captain and a leader of the team.\n\nHowever, a noteworthy aspect of Steve Smith is his captaincy for the Washington Freedom, besides the batting. This is because he has been around, and he is the one who uses his maturity in dealing with the team when it is steamed up. The young players within the team have thus greatly benefited from him, and Washington has become one of the most balanced and charged teams in the tournament.\n\nEverybody will focus on the performance of Steve Smith in Major League Cricket 2024 as the competition goes on. His comeback to T20 cricket is a sign of versatility and the ambition of the player seeking to be the best. Looking at the coming rounds of matches and the knockout stages, especially, Steve Smith and his ability to lead the team will be very vital to the success of the Washington Freedom.\n\nIn any case, the MLC 2024 season alone is more than enough to establish Steve Smith as the most prominent cricketer of the current and perhaps future generations, thereby expressing that class and quality in the cricket field do not have an expiration date at the international level."

He smashed 55 runs to power them to a respectable total.\n\nThe Afghanistan star, enroute his special knock, showcased glimpses of AB de Villiers and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, playing few shots similar to how the veteran cricketers’ played. He took only 30 balls to smash his blistering knock, which was studded with four boundaries and as many sixes. In his innings, he played several beautiful shots but his aerial shot over the backward point and a helicopter shot mesmerised everyone, which was akin to de Villiers and Dhoni.\n\nHere’s the video\n\nBesides putting up a memorable batting show, Rashid also had a good day with the ball, conceding 22 runs off his four overs. However, his valiant all-round effort went in vain, with TSK chasing the 164-run target easily, riding on clinical fifties from Devon Conway and Faf du Plessis."

Therefore, Gambhir believes that both individuals will have a role to play in all departments.\n\n\"I have worked with people like Abhishek Nayar, Ryan Ten Doeschate very closely. In the last two months, especially in the IPL, I have enjoyed working with them. They are thorough professionals. Hope Ryan and Abhishek can have a successful stint. Hopefully, we can have a successful tenure as coaches. I am really looking forward to working with the rest of the other guys as well\" Gambhir said.\n\n\"They (BCCI) have agreed to most of the things I have asked for. Abhishek and Ryan as assistant coaches are going to be the crux of the support staff. I personally feel they could be assistant coaches, who can involve themselves more in all three departments rather than just one. That’s the reason we now have two assistant coaches. As I said, we still have one month after the Sri Lanka tour. We will try and finalise after the Sri Lanka tour,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Cricbuzz reports, former South Africa international, Morne Morkel, who has also been a part of KKR in the past, is a heavy favourite to be included in India's coaching setup as the bowling coach. Gambhir has worked with Morkel in the past, as a part of the Lucknow Super Giants franchise.\n\nMORE: When will Morne Morkel join up with the Indian team as the new bowling coach?\n\nTeam India led by captain Suryakumar Yadav, will play the 1st T20I of the 3-match series at R Premadasa Stadium in Pallekele, starting July 27."

All three were part of the Kolkata Knight Riders coaching staff in IPL 2024. Gambhir was the mentor, Nayar the assistant coach, and Ten Doeschate was designated as the team's fielding coach. The former Netherlands star, in fact, played five seasons under Gambhir's captaincy in KKR. Between 2011 and 2015, ten Doeschate featured in 41 matches for KKR. He was inducted into the three-time champions' support staff even before Gambhir came on board for the last season.\n\nThis is the first time the Indian cricket setup is seeing two assistant coaches. Notably, there was no such post during Anil Kumble, Ravi Shastri or Rahul Dravid's tenures. There was a batting coach, a bowling coach, a fielding coach and other support staff members comprising throwdown specialists, physios, analysts and others.\n\nThings are slightly different in Gambhir's tenure, at least as things stand now. He has appointed two assistant coaches in Nayar and ten Doeschate. There are no mentions of a batting coach. T Dilip, Inda's fielding coach during Dravid's tenure, has got an extension. Regarding the bowling coach, NCA coach Sairaj Bahutule is in Sri Lanka as a stop-gap arrangement. There are reports of Gambhir showing interest in getting former South Africa pacer Morne Morkel, another old associate of the former India opener, on board.\n\nThere are no official announcements from the BCCI regarding Gambhir's support staff, but it will likely come after the Sri Lanka tour.\n\nGambhir eager to work with Nayar and ten Doeschate\n\n“Really happy with the BCCI. They have agreed to most of the things I have asked for. I was really surprised when I was reading all the news. Abhishek, as assistant coach, Ryan, as assistant coach. I feel there could be assistant coaches working and focussing on all three departments rather than one specific department. That's the reason we now have two assistant coaches. That's the way we will go forward as well. Yes, we will get to know the exact support staff after the Sri Lanka tour,” Gambhir said.\n\nGambhir spoke about his experience of working with Nayar and Ten Doeschate in KKR earlier this season when the franchise lifted their third IPL title. “This is going to be the crux of the support staff. As I said, we still have one month after the Sri Lanka tour. We will try and finalise after the Sri Lanka tour. But, I have worked with people like Abhishek Nayar, Ryan ten Doeschate very closely. In the last two months, especially in the IPL, I have enjoyed working with them. They are thorough professionals. Hope Ryan and Abhishek can have a successful stint.

Led by Faf du Plessis' quickfire fifty, the fastest by a batter this season, the Texas Super Kings had a strong start to their run-chase.\n\nAlso Read | QPR vs Tottenham Hotspur, Club Friendly 2024 Live Streaming Online in India: How To Watch Pre-Season Football Match Live Telecast on TV & Football Score Updates in IST?.\n\nThe Proteas opener propelled his team to 76 runs in the powerplay. However, Washington's bowlers executed a brilliant comeback in the middle overs. Jasdeep Singh, Glenn Maxwell, and Ravindra shared the 10 wickets among them, but it was Lockie Ferguson's crucial over to Du Plessis after the powerplay that turned the tide. Lockie conceded only 2 wides in that over, eventually leading to Faf's dismissal.\n\nSoon after, the Super Kings' batting lineup crumbled, losing 4 wickets for just 15 runs between overs 7.1 and 11.6, ultimately costing them the match. While Calvin Savage managed to strike a few powerful blows towards the end, it only served to narrow the margin of defeat.\n\nAlso Read | Rangers vs Manchester United, Club Friendly 2024 Live Streaming Online in India: How To Watch Pre-Season Football Match Live Telecast on TV & Football Score Updates in IST?.\n\nEarlier, Washington Freedom posted a formidable target of 206 for the Texas Super Kings. The fireworks began early, with Travis Head delivering a scintillating performance in the powerplay. He hammered 53 runs off just 22 balls, dismantling the seamers with ease and giving Washington a flying start.\n\nAs spin was introduced, the scoring rate slowed slightly, thanks to some purchase on the used pitch. However, Maxwell played a pivotal role in maintaining the momentum, contributing crucial runs in the middle overs. Towards the tail end of the innings, Pienaar provided a valuable boost, ensuring a strong finish for the team.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Smith (57) also continued his consistent performances, nearly batting through the entire innings and securing a well-earned fifty. His steady presence at the crease anchored the Washington innings and kept the scoreboard ticking.\n\nThe start given by the two Australian batters was more than enough for the middle order of the Washington-based side to take on the rest of the bowlers. Maxwell (34) and Obus Pienaar (33) both scored crucial runs to ensure their team put up a tough target that the Texas Super Kings were eventually unable to chase down.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom 206/5 (Steve Smith 57, Travis Head 53, Noor Ahmad 3/38) vs Texas Super Kings 164 (Faf du Plessis 55, Calvin Savage 35, Rachin Ravindra 4/16).

The withdrawal of the Pakistan trio of Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Afridi will be a dampener, especially for the Pakistan fans. However, with the players from USA and Canada forming a local connection, the current edition of the tournament is set to be a cracking one.\n\nLike the Hundred, a few teams will miss their marquee players who are playing in the Hundred playoffs but other than that, the short 17-day tournament promises to be an exhilarating ride.\n\nWhen and where to watch Global T20 Canada League on TV and OTT in India?\n\nThe Global T20 Canada matches will have a 1:30 AM IST start on the next day of the scheduled matchday as per local time. On double-header days, the matches will have an 8:30 PM IST start on the scheduled matchday and a 1:30 AM start for the second game on the next day. Only the second qualifier and the final are scheduled for a 9:30PM IST start.\n\nThe Hundred men and women's competitions will be broadcast live on TV through Star Sports Network while the live streaming will be available on the Fancode app and website."

The high-octane clash is scheduled at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nTEX vs NY: Team Previews\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nLed by Faf du Plessis, Texas Super Kings have had a topsy-turvy journey in the Major League Cricket, occupying the third position in the six-team standings with three wins in seven outings.\n\nSkipper Du Plessis has been the most significant contributor in the batting department, while New Zealand's Devon Conway being the second-best with 180 runs in six matches.\n\nHowever, the Super Kings would want better returns from their bowlers, who have mostly failed to strike at crucial junctures.\n\nZia-ul-Haq and Marcus Stoinis have scalped six wickets each, while Noor Ahmad has showcased his mettle, picking up five wickets in two outings.\n\nMI New York\n\nPollard and Pooran will be key players for MINY [X]\n\nOn the other hand, MI New York had a disastrous run in the first half of the competition, losing four of their first six matches.\n\nHowever, riding on a heroic knock from skipper Kieron Pollard, MI finally broke their losing streak and entered the playoffs with a four-wicket victory over Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nMarquee overseas players Rashid Khan and Trent Boult have been exceptional with the ball, while Nicholas Pooran has emerged as MI's wrecker-in-chief with the bat, scoring 172 runs in six games.\n\nHowever, the fact that Rashid Khan is MI's second-highest run-getter highlights their collective failure as a batting unit.\n\nSo, moving on to this must-win game, MI New York would like better performances from their batters- particularly Dewald Brevis.\n\nTEX vs NY: Match details & Live streaming\n\nTEX vs NY: Grand Prairie Stadium pitch report\n\nThe surface at Grand Prairie Stadium will offer minimal seam movement to the fast bowlers. However, the pacers might succeed with their change-ups as it's the 13th MLC 2024 game at this venue.\n\nSo, the ball could hold up a bit, also offering a hint of turn to the spinners. The track generally behaves similarly across the match; so, expect the toss-winner to bowl first.\n\nTEX vs NY: Probable playing XIs\n\nTexas Super Kings: Devon Conway (WK), Faf du Plessis (C), Aaron Hardie, Joshua Tromp, Milind Kumar, Marcus Stoinis, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, Mohammad Mohsin, Noor Ahmad, Zia-ul-Haq\n\nMI New York: Ruben Clinton, Dewald Brevis, Nicholas Pooran, Monank Patel, Kieron Pollard (C), Romario Shepherd, Rashid Khan, Heath Richards, Trent Boult, Nosthush Kenjige, Rushil Ugarkar\n\nTEX vs NY: Fantoss fantasy tips\n\nTEX vs NY: Winner Prediction\n\nConsidering the strength of both teams, we reckon MI New York will emerge victorious in this match."

Despite an early breakthrough from Pat Cummins, who dismissed Steve Smith and bowled a maiden over, the Unicorns couldn't maintain the momentum as Carmi le Roux and Haris Rauf failed to contain Head's explosive batting.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns had a dismal start, losing four wickets before reaching the 50-run mark. Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar provided early breakthroughs, supported by Ravindra's critical wicket of Sanjay Krishnamurthi. Despite a half-century from Hassan Khan, the Unicorns managed only 145 runs. Washington's comprehensive win places them in the MLC final, while the Unicorns will compete against Texas Super Kings for a spot in the summit clash.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

He returned with the figures of 3/38 but his effort went in vain as Texas Super Kings lost to Washington Freedom. They failed to chase the target of 207 runs and lost the game by 42 runs. He would be extremely vital for his team going ahead in the tournament.\n\nNoor Ahmad also was involved in a rapid-fire session.

        "body": "26 Jul, 9.39am After all those thrilling finishes in the Major League Cricket 2024, we are now down to the last two games to find out who will lift the title this time. Washington Freedom has already sealed a spot in the Final after winning the Qualifier against San Francisco Unicorns. The challenger though will be played between the winner of Eliminator, Texas Super Kings and the loser of the Qualifier, San Francisco Unicorns at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. Both sides faced each other earlier in the tournament and it was Texas Super Kings who won that contest by 7 wickets. The contest between the Texas Super Kings and San Francisco Unicorns has every ingredient of being a cagey contest with both sides depending on their top order while the bowling is their mainstay. The skipper of Texas Super Kings, Faf du Plessis has led them from the front and sits on top of the run-getters chart and his partner Devon Conway also features in the top 5 run-getters of this edition. The worrying part for the Texas Super Kings is they rely heavily on their top order and the likes of Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Hardie, and the rest of the batting order are yet to deliver when it matters the most. The bowling has done well and the likes of Noor Ahmad, Zia-ul-Haq, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, and Marcus Stoinis have combined well to create a perfect mix of spin and pace. Their opponents on the other hand, San Francisco Unicorns do bat heavy at the top but do possess threatening batters in the middle order as well. Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, and Sanjay Krishnamurthi form an explosive top three while players such as Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford comprise a solid middle order. The bowling looks balanced too with Pat Cummins leading the bowling attack along with Haris Rauf, Carmi le Roux, and Juanoy Drysdale while Hassan Khan will look to trap the opposition batters with his left-arm spinners. With two sides equally capable of dismantling their opponents, this promises to be no less than a thriller."

        "body": "Rachin Ravindra’s all-round bowling performance and Travis Head’s fifth straight fifty powered Washington Freedom to the final of the Major League Cricket 2024 season with a seven-wicket win over San Francisco Unicorns in the Qualifier at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday.\n\nRachin Ravindra once again recorded career-best figures in T20 cricket, picking up 4/11 as Marco Jansen finished with 3/46 from four overs to bowl out the Unicorns for 145. Hassan Khan was the pick of the batters for SFU scoring 57 off 36 balls.\n\nIn reply, Head top-scored in the match with an unbeaten 77 off just 44 balls, his highest score this season, as we raced to 149/3 with 27 balls to spare. The Aussie opener hit 10 fours and three sixes during his knock, his fifth consecutive fifty in MLC 2024.\n\nGlenn Maxwell also smashed 54 off just 23 balls to take us into our first final of the MLC. He smashed five sixes and four boundaries to complete a comprehensive win for us.\n\nBowling first, Jansen struck with the third ball of the innings to dismiss Finn Allen, caught safely by wicketkeeper Andries Gous. Saurabh Netravalkar was right on the money as ever, sending back Jake Fraser-McGurk after constantly frustrating him with dot balls. Jansen picked up another wicket off the last ball of the powerplay as SFU slid to 49/3. The spin pair of Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell kept things tight as only 26 runs came in the next six overs with SFU losing two more wickets.\n\nAfter attaining some stability, the SFU innings suffered once again as Jansen accounted for Anderson to get his third dismissal of the night. The last five wickets fell for just 18 runs as they closed out in 145.\n\nChasing 146, Travis Head carted three sixes and two fours off Carmi le Roux as we got past the fifty-run mark at the end of the powerplay.\n\nHead coasted to his half-century off just 28 balls in the 10th over as Maxwell shifted gears soon after with back-to-back sixes off Hassan. Maxwell put on a show as he took apart the SFU bowling attack with his power and panache reaching his fifty in only 22 balls. The Aussie scored 46 of his total runs in boundaries.\n\nMaxwell and Head added an unbroken 85 runs in just 40 balls for the fourth wicket to make light work of the chase. Maxwell looked in a hurry as he closed the match in style with a four off pacer Haris Rauf. Hassan Khan picked up two wickets for the SFU.\n\nWith the win, we proceed to the final of MLC 2024 to be played at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Sunday.\n\nWashington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns MLC 2024 brief scores: SFU 145/10 in 19 overs (Hassan Khan 57, Corey Anderson 26, Rachin Ravindra 4/11, Marco Jansen 3/46) vs WF 149/3 in 15.3 overs (Travis Head 77*, Glenn Maxwell 54*, Hassan Khan 2/32).\n\nWashington Freedom won by seven wickets."

        "body": "In an exciting match at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, the Texas Super Kings, led by Calvin Savage, defeated the Seattle Orcas by 37 runs in the final league match of Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024.\n\nMatch Highlights\n\nDespite a strong start by Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya, the Seattle Orcas couldn’t chase down the target of 178 runs. The Texas Super Kings’ bowlers, including Ottneil Bartmann, Noor Ahmad, and Calvin Savage, played a crucial role in dismantling the Seattle batting lineup.\n\nSeattle Orcas’ Run Chase\n\nSeattle Orcas began their chase with a setback as Ryan Rickleton was dismissed for a duck on the first ball. Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya tried to stabilize the innings, but both were dismissed by the seventh and ninth overs, respectively. Heinrich Klaasen and Matthew Bracewell couldn’t contribute much, and the team struggled to keep up with the required run rate.\n\nShubham Ranjane and Keemo Paul tried to keep the Orcas in the game, but their efforts were in vain as the team finished at 140/9. Ottneil Bartmann was the standout bowler for the Texas Super Kings, taking three wickets for just 20 runs.\n\nTexas Super Kings’ Innings\n\nEarlier, the Texas Super Kings had a shaky start, losing openers Devon Conway and Joshua Tromp early. However, Faf Du Plessis played a brilliant knock, scoring 39 runs off 17 balls. Calvin Savage was the star of the innings, remaining unbeaten with 45 runs off 27 balls, helping the team reach a total of 177/8.\n\nKeemo Paul was the best bowler for the Seattle Orcas, taking two wickets for 18 runs.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith this victory, the Texas Super Kings secured their spot in the eliminator match against MI New York. The Seattle Orcas, on the other hand, ended their campaign with six losses and only one win."
