        "date": "Sat Jul  6 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Good Saturday morning! I hope those of you in the U.S. are enjoying a long, peaceful holiday weekend. And hopefully your neighborhood is quieter than mine was last night. Enough with the fireworks already!! I’m going to be up early and on the road today, then this evening I have to fill in for someone at my other job. I’ll try to monitor the comments as best as I can, when I have time and good reception.\n\nNow then, let’s welcome back Major League Cricket for its second season. Last year I did a uni review for the inaugural kits. It includes a brief explanation of what T-20 cricket is, and why this league genuinely deserves to be called “Major,” so if you’re unfamiliar with the sport, do give that a look. Last night, Season Two opened with a couple of games… one in Morrisville, North Carolina and the other in Grand Prairie, Texas. The first matchup featured the defending champion MI New York…\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n…taking on the Seattle Orcas.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nMI NY (the MI stands for Mumbai Indians, the Indian Premier League franchise that runs this team) made some tweaks from last year’s uni, dropping the dark pants stripe in favor of a thin gold stripe that also crosses the backside, and changing the tinsel-y side panels to a diamond pattern. The one thing they DESPERATELY needed to drop was those shiny gold numbers that the parent club is so fond of wearing. Yeah, in the right light *and* at the right angle they look fine.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nBut as you saw in the first photo, they can be illegible even in the same lighting. Such a shame, because with regular gold numbers, this could be a really good uni. I especially like the…I guess that’s an art deco sublimation on the jerseys.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nSeattle looks pretty much the same from last year’s kit.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nI will be saying that for some other teams as well, and when I do I realize some of them have different ads on the jerseys and/or pants. I don’t care about that. I’m trying my best to ignore the ads and enjoy the cricket. So glad the Orcas logo remains on the batting helmets. That’s my favorite logo from the whole league.\n\nThe second game featured the Texas Super Kings hosting the LA Knight Riders in a vibrant matchup.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nLA really toned down the gold sublimation this year as opposed to last season. The purple seems toned down as well. I would have kept that the same, but overall I like this version better. Also, I really REALLY like bowler Ali Khan’s jersey!\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nIt’s always nice to see when players are allowed to opt out of wearing the jersey ad. LA’s main advertiser is a betting site out of Bangladesh. I wouldn’t wear that either. You can get a better look at Ali Khan and both team’s unis in this video of him taking three of his four wickets…one of them thanks to a great barehanded catch by Derone Davis.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nI’m usually not one for a lot of technology in sports, but I do love those light-up stumps. I also love how LA Gets It with their use of gold. Yes, the helmets and pads are a little shiny, but not in a reflective way.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nThe numbers, as you saw in the video, are just right. Meanwhile, Texas seems the same as last year. I liked it then and I like it now.\n\nThat leaves two teams that haven’t played yet. The Washington Freedom looks the same in the lede photo as they did last season, while the San Francisco Unicorns appear to have dropped their contrasting blue sleeves in favor of a more orange jersey. I’m calling this a downgrade, but we’ll see how it looks once they actually take the field today. Here’s a closer look of all the new uniforms.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nThe reason I said “Don’t blink” in the headline is because while most T-20 leagues play for roughly two months, Major League Cricket is played completely in the month of July. For now. Each of the six teams play seven regular season games, half of what is played in the IPL. It’s almost the same length as the Caribbean Premier League, which starts at the end of August and ends in the first week of October. So enjoy all the MLC action while you can!"

        "body": "Remember Unmukt Chand? Once the captain of an U19 World Cup-winning India side, the right-handed top order batsman has been through many ups and downs since. Now, despite changing to US citizenship, Chand was left out of the USA squad that shocked everyone and reached the Super 8 of the 2024 T20 World Cup. However, Chand, 31, has a point to prove, and started off the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) - USA's franchise T20 league - with a swashbuckling half-century.\n\nInterestingly, Chand's present MLC franchise is Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), who are owned by the Knight Riders group. Many might remember that Chand's downfall started when he was famously clean bowled by Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Brett Lee in the opening ball of IPL 2013.\n\nAfter finishing bottom of the table in the first season of MLC last year, LAKR required a strong start to MLC 2024. Chand, coming in to bat at no. 3, took charge in the opening match against Texas Super Kings, after openers Jason Roy and Sunil Narine had been dismissed for two runs each.\n\nChand made 68 off 45 balls, hitting six 4s and three 6s. No other batter in the LAKR lineup crossed 30, and only one crossed 20. It was Chand's effort that took LAKR to a respectable total of 162/7.\n\nStar names like David Miller and Andre Russell failed to score big as well. Russell only made 10, while Miller was out for four after his T20 World Cup final heartbreak.\n\nIn response, Texas Super Kings (TSK) fell short by 12 runs. Frontline USA pacer Ali Khan dismantled the TSK middle order, picking up three wickets, that saw TSK lose four wickets in five balls between the 14th and 15th over.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders next play San Francisco Unicorns on July 8."

The top order struggled and kept losing wickets in regular succession. Trent Boult picked up a couple of early wickets and put Seattle Orcas under a lot of pressure. With their key batters gone, Orcas went into more trouble after Rashid Khan removed their premier batter Heinrich Klaasen. Harmeet Singh hit a couple of boundaries but he too got out at a wrong time and Orcas were eventually bowled out for 108.\n\nDuring the chase, MI New York also started off badly. They could barely score any runs in the Powerplay overs, while losing both their openers. After this phase, Nicholas Pooran took the responsibility of taking MI New York over the line. He smashed 62 runs in 37 balls, stayed not out and took MI New York home with 6 wickets in hand.\n\nCurrent Form Washington Freedom:\n\nWashington Freedom played well in the previous edition of the Major League Cricket. They reached the Playoffs but lost to MI New York in the Eliminator match to get knocked out.\n\nThe top run scorer for Washington Freedom in the previous edition was Matthew Short with 152 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Washington Freedom in the previous edition was Saurabh Netravalkar with 10 scalps under his belt.\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup hero for USA, Saurabh Netravalkar is a part of the Washington Freedom squad. He will add X factor to the team. Batters like Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra and Andries Gous are also part of the team and they will infuse a lot of wisdom to the entire unit throughout the tournament. Washington Freedom have a great chance to win the Major League Cricket 2024 title.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Andries Gous - He performed like a champion in the recently concluded ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Gous can hit the ball a long way and he is expected to be Washington Freedom's best batter this season.\n\n2. Lockie Ferguson- He looked in great touch in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, despite New Zealand getting knocked out in the first round. Ferguson will have a big role to play for Washington Freedom with the ball in hand.\n\nBatting Stats T20"

        "body": "oi-Aditya K Halder\n\nThe Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 season's match 3 turned out to be a rain-affected match between Washington Freedom and MI New York (MINY) at Church Street Park in Morisville, North Carolina.\n\nWashington Freedom emerged victorious by four runs through the DLS method, marking a strong start to their campaign. Washington Freedom captain Steve Smith won the toss and elected to field first.\n\nThe decision proved to be wise as USA's rising cricket star Saurabh Netravalkar spearheaded the bowling attack with a superb performance. Netravalkar, named 'Player of the Match,' delivered an impressive spell, claiming 3 wickets for just 24 runs.\n\nHe was well-supported by fellow pacer Justin Dill, who also took 3 wickets, conceding 33 runs. The pair ensured that MI New York's batting line-up never found stability, with wickets falling at regular intervals.\n\nDespite the regular fall of wickets, West Indies power-hitter Nicholas Pooran showcased his batting prowess with a rapid 44 off 30 balls, keeping the scoreboard ticking. Contributions from Afghanistan all-rounder Rashid Khan, who scored a quickfire 31 off 15 balls, and South African fast bowler Anrich Nortje, with 14 off 9 balls, helped MI New York reach a respectable total of 154 for 9 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nChasing a target of 155 with rain clouds threatening, Washington Freedom's innings got off to a shaky start. Australian World Cup winner Travis Head fell early for just 1 run in the second over.\n\nHowever, Steve Smith, who opened the innings with Head, anchored the chase with a measured yet aggressive approach. Smith played a captain's knock, scoring an unbeaten 46 off 28 balls, including 4 fours and 3 sixes. His steady presence at the crease was complemented by Andries Gous, who supported well from the other end.\n\nAs Washington reached 55 for 1 in 7.4 overs, play was halted due to lightning, followed by rain, which prevented any further action. With no resumption in sight, the match officials resorted to the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method to determine the result. Thanks to Smith's brisk scoring rate, Washington Freedom edged out MI New York by four runs under the DLS calculations, securing their first win of the season."

The match was a tightly contested one. In the second innings, Washington Freedom faced an early setback with the dismissal of Travis Head (1). Steve Smith initially took a couple of overs to settle in, but once he found his rhythm and struck his first boundary on his seventh ball, the New York bowlers struggled to contain him.

However, Smith’s power-hitting in the final over of the powerplay took them ahead on DLS with a score of 55/1. In the end, that proved enough to seal the match as rain played spoilsport.\n\nEarlier in the day, the MI New York struggled to score freely against a disciplined bowling attack after being put into bat first. Despite Nicholas Pooran's valiant effort, scoring a 30-ball 44, New York faced consistent setbacks with regular loss of wickets. Opener Ruben Clinton (28) gave his team a strong platform with a good start, but the introduction of Glenn Maxwell proved lethal as he was bowled while attempting a reverse sweep.\n\nWith Monank Patel (5) and Shayan Jahangir (6) having lost their wickets, all eyes were on Pooran, who found the regular boundaries. Despite the wickets falling at the other end, Pooran kept the pressure on the Washington Freedom bowlers.\n\nLockie Ferguson was the breakthrough bowler for MI New York, as Pooran’s mistimed shot fell to Glenn Maxwell. Eventually, Pooran was aided by a crucial cameo from Rashid Khan, who smashed 31 off 15, and some valuable boundaries from Anrich Nortje (14), which propelled them to 154.

In the recently concluded T20 World Cup 2024, he finished as the 3rd leading run-scorer with 255 runs in 7 matches.\n\nTop Pick – All-Rounder\n\nGlenn Maxwell had a decent T20 World Cup for his standards, scoring 132 runs at an average of 26.4 and picking up 3 wickets at an economy of 8.58.\n\nTop Pick – Bowler\n\nA lot of things can change in cricket but Trent Boult providing breakthroughs in the powerplay doesn’t change.

They made plenty of changes to their squad signing marquee players from Australia and New Zealand including the likes of Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Lockie Ferguson, Andrew Tye, Rachin Ravindra, Jack Edwards, and skipper Steven Smith. Marco Jansen and Akeal Hosein are the only two overseas players retained by the franchise for the second edition.\n\nThe retained domestic players are Andries Gous, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, and Saurabh Netravalkar. The franchise felt they couldn’t succeed last year due to their inconsistent batting which made them sign superstars from the Australian continent. Will they be able to go further this year we need to wait and watch.\n\nMI New York off the mark in an exceptional manner with a 6-wicket win over Seattle Orcas in the opening game of the tournament opener on Saturday. World-class bowlers Trent Boult and Rashid Khan ripped off the opposition batters, picking up 3 wickets apiece, and in the end restricted them to a total of 108. The duo got much-needed support from Ehsan Adil, Anrich Nortje and Kieron Pollard who got the remaining 4 scalps.\n\nThey didn’t get a positive start to the run-chase, losing their openers for just 16 runs but Global T20 superstar Nicholas Pooran seemed like he was batting completely on a different surface and smashed 62* runs in just 37 balls to pull off a convincing win for the defending champions with 34 balls to spare. They make a formidable team with Kagiso Rabada, Dewald Brevis, and Romario Shepherd still waiting on the bench to make an impression."

Nicholas Pooran exemplified it yet again by grabbing a scintillating catch behind the stumps to dismiss the dangerous Travis Head as MI New York squared off against Washington Freedom at Church Street Park, Morrisville.\n\nPlaying their first game of the second Major League Cricket edition, the Washington-based franchise won the toss and elected to field first under overcast conditions. Saurabh Nethravalkar and Justin Dill starred with the ball, scalping three-fers each to curb the New York side to 154, thanks to Nicholas Pooran’s 44. In reply, the New York side got an early breakthrough and it was Pooran who had to be credited for an outstanding catch.\n\nAfter a three-run first over, Ehsan Adil bowled a good length delivery outside the off stump to Head. The southpaw intended to execute a drive on that but played inside the line and got the outside edge toward the left of the gloveman. Pooran was excellent with his reflex as he leaped to his left and grasped the white cherry with his left-hand to complete a stunner. Time and again, Head has played some unreal knocks across formats in the past couple of years, and the early blow acted as a sigh of relief for New York.\n\nNickyP Brilliance!\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0"

However, the left-arm pacer was expensive overall on the day as he finished with 2-43 in his four overs.\n\nLike Shoriful, Taskin also gave Colombo early success defending a total of 199 runs as the right-arm pacer bowled Dinesh Chandimal in his second over of the match.\n\nTaskin, who only conceded 19 runs in his first three overs, leaked 11 runs in his last over but his side went on the defend their total in the last over thriller.\n\nMeanwhile, pacer Mustafizur Rahman finished with 2-39 in his four overs during his side Dambulla Sixers' third match of the tournament against Jaffna Kings at the same venue in the day's other match.\n\nMustafizur started well in the match as he dismissed Kusal Mendis in his first over after getting hit for a boundary but he was expensive in his last two overs where he conceded 12 runs each.\n\nJaffna finished with 218-5 in their 20 overs riding on two blazing innings from Pathum Nissanka (88 off 53 balls) and Avishka Fernando (57 off 30 balls) after being sent into bat first.\n\nDambulla's other Bangladeshi recruit Towhid Hridoy was benched for the game."

As they begin a fresh campaign against the same team, Washington will be eager to exact revenge.\n\nThe franchise has made wholesale changes to its squad, especially when it comes to international players, with Akeal Hosein and Marco Jansen being the only ones retained. The biggest names are undoubtedly the Aussie trio of Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head.\n\nThey add plenty of firepower to the top and middle order, and Freedom will be looking towards a big total if any one of them gets going. Rachin Ravindra too makes a debut in the squad, adding all-round capabilities.\n\nAndre Tye and Lockie Ferguson will join Saurabh Netravalkar in the pace department, while Yasir Mohammad and Amila Aponso are likely to be the two spinners in the playing XI.\n\nWashington Freedom Playing 11\n\nTravis Head, Andries Gous, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Justin Dill, Akeal Hosein, Lockie Ferguson, Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nMI New York\n\nThe defending champions began the season with a bang by defeating the Seattle Orcas in a convincing fashion. However, as they play their second match in less than 24 hours, New York must keep their momentum going.\n\nNicholas Pooran was once again in top form as he smashed an unbeaten half-century to help his team chase down a modest target quite easily. He, along with Shayan Jahangir, and Steven Taylor makes up for a strong middle order. New York is also likely to avail the services of Tim David and Kieron Pollard as all-rounders.\n\nNew York boasts one of the strongest and well-balanced bowling units in the league.\n\nTrent Boult, Ehsan Adil, and Anrich Nortje are the 3 quality seamers on the team who picked up 5 wickets between them on Friday. Rashid Khan, who is fresh off a brilliant T20 World Cup campaign, will lead the spin attack.\n\nMI New York Playing 11\n\nRuben Clinton, Monank Patel, Nicholas Pooran, Shayan Jahangir, Timothy David, Kieron Pollard, Rashid Khan, Nosthush Kenjige, Trent Boult, Anrich Nortje, Ehsan Adil."

        "body": "The Stateside cricket fever continues as the new Major League Cricket season is here to fill the void after the T20I World Cup. After a successful first season, the franchise cricket league is set to return with even more flair. ICC has granted List A accreditation to the competition, so it will be able to attract more star power from around the world. Who will win the second edition of Major League Cricket? Join us for our exclusive 2024 MLC predictions and tips.\n\nMLC 2024: Cricket Event Details\n\nSome of the team crests and names might make you think that Major League Cricket is the US expansion of the Indian Premier League. While the competition has a strong connection to the IPL, MLC is attempting to carve its own identity into the vast and diverse sporting landscape of the US.\n\nSix teams return to battle it out for the MLC title, just like last season, to grab the attention of the best cricket World Cup bookies. All the action unfolds at the familiar Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park, with matches running from 5th to 28th of July. Get ready to see some of the world’s biggest T20 stars lighting up the American cricket scene with their world-class finesse.\n\nℹ️ Tournament: 2024 Major League Cricket, T20 Cricket Tournament 📝 Format: Round-robin system with playoffs 🏏 Venues: Grand Prairie Stadium, Grand Prairie, Nashville, Tennessee 🗓️ Dates: Friday, 5 July to Sunday, 28 July, 2024\n\nMI New York @ 3.25 (9/4)\n\nNew York edged into the playoffs last year, then turned on the afterburners, thanks to a fiery batting display by Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran. The latter, in particular, was unstoppable in the final, smashing an unbeaten 137 to secure the MLC title for New York. With a bowling attack boasting Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Trent Boult, and the ever-reliable Kieron Pollard, they’ll be firm favorites to defend their crown. What do we think of them in our 2024 MLC season predictions? We’ll find out later.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns @ 4.60 (18/5)\n\nThe Unicorns’ 2023 season was a heartbreaker. Despite only managing two wins, they were agonizingly edged out of the playoffs by the eventual champions, MI New York, on net run rate. But they haven’t sat still. They’ve brought in some exciting new talent, so expect a much stronger showing this year. Could they be a real threat to make the playoffs? Those who bet on MLC 2024 online believe they can.\n\nWashington Freedom @ 7.00 (6/1)\n\nWith a lineup packed with big hitters like the in-form South African Andries Gous, fresh off his World Cup heroics, and the established duo of Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head, they have the firepower to go all the way. Their bowling attack is a force to be reckoned with, too, boasting the pace of Kiwi Lockie Ferguson and the spin wizardry of South Africa’s Marco Jansen. Make bets safe but entertaining while placing your punt on Washington making the playoffs.\n\nSeattle Orcas @ 7.00 (6/1)\n\nAfter dominating the group stage with four wins out of five, they went on a tear through the Eliminator and Challenger, only to fall short in the final. Given the quality of the Orcas squad, many 2024 MLC predictions will see them making a deep run in the tournament once again. With two world-class hitters like Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen leading the charge and a bolstered bowling attack thanks to the draft, the Seattle side will look to nail down the title that narrowly escaped them last year.\n\nMI New York to Win Outright @ 3.25 (9/4)\n\nMain Prediction\n\nMI New York to Win Outright\n\nBest odds:\n\n3.25 (9/4)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n2 (100%)\n\n0\n\nMI New York took their time to get going last season, but they could turn up the heat much earlier this season. According to the 2024 Major League Cricket odds, Nicholas Pooran and company are the frontrunners in the title race. After taking a deep look into their squad, we are convinced that they have the best chance as well.\n\nMI New York boasts a terrifying pace attack this season, spearheaded by the lethal trio of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and Anrich Nortje. Together, these world-class fast bowlers can dismantle any batting lineup in the tournament.\n\nComplementing their fearsome pace attack, MI New York has a crafty spin duo that will make life difficult for opposing batsmen. The legendary Rashid Khan leads the spin department, with rising star Nosthush Kenjige providing support.\n\nNicholas Pooran, Dewald Brevis, Kieron Pollard, and Tim David are a nightmare to face for any bowling attack. These hard hitters can single-handedly change the game’s momentum with their explosive batting.\n\nBut MI New York’s batting depth doesn’t stop there. Players like Monank Patel, Rashid Khan, and Romario Shepherd offer valuable flexibility, providing the right mix of power and stability depending on the situation and pitch.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders and MI New York to Play the Final @ 5.00 (4/1)\n\nRisky Bet\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders and MI New York to Play the Final\n\nBest odds:\n\n5.00 (4/1)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n1 (50%)\n\n(50%) 1\n\nWe are rooting for the Los Angeles Knight Riders to have a strong season this time around following their horror debut campaign.\n\nSeasoned T20 veterans like Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, and Shakib Al Hasan bring both dynamism and depth to the squad. Their extensive experience is a valuable asset, and the team will undoubtedly be leaning on these three stalwarts to significantly improve upon their last-place finish from the previous season.\n\nWe believe the 2024 Los Angeles Knight Riders squad has what it takes to make a grand final run, but MI New York might be too overpowering for them in the final.\n\nTravis Head Highest Run Scorer @ 7.50 (13/2)\n\nRisky Bet\n\nTravis Head Highest Run Scorer\n\nBest odds:\n\n7.50 (13/2)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n2 (100%)\n\n0\n\nFueled by Travis Head’s explosive batting, the Washington Freedom have a strong chance to make a deep run in the tournament. While a championship victory might be out of reach, they could become a real force to be reckoned with, with Head leading the charge.\n\nThe Aussie opener has shown excellent T20 form this year. He was one of the Orange Cap contenders in the IPL with 567 runs to his name in 15 innings. For his country, he has returned 255 runs in seven appearances.\n\nFresh off his T20 World Cup experience in the Americas, the left-handed batsman appears primed to dominate the MLC scoring charts.\n\nTrent Boult Highest Wicket Taker @ 11.00 (10/1)\n\nRisky Bet\n\nTrent Boult Highest Wicket Taker\n\nBest odds:\n\n11.00 (10/1)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n1 (50%)\n\n(50%) 1\n\nTrent Boult was instrumental in MI New York’s historic campaign last year. The Kiwi paceman bagged a staggering 22 wickets, twice the number of his closest competitor.\n\nOver the years, Boult has established himself as one of the most lethal bowlers in T20 cricket. He has been particularly effective during power-play overs. With an excellent ability to swing the ball with incredible pace, Boult will be back to terrorize the batters once again in MI New York colors.\n\nThe recently retired New Zealand pacer hunted down nine wickets in four appearances for his country this year before hanging up his Black Caps kit. He also claimed 15 wickets in the 2024 IPL season. Everything points toward another sensational MLC campaign for the 34-year-old."
