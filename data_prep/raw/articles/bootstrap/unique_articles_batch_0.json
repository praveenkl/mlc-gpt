    "body": "Cricket may not be as popular a sport in the U.S. as elsewhere in the world, but some high-profile CEOs and investors are trying to change that.\n\nAs the Men's T20 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S. for the first time, ramps up, investors have pumped nearly a billion dollars into their American ambition.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen are among the executives investing in the new U.S. professional league, Major League Cricket. Other cricket investors include Iconic Ventures, Madrona Venture Group and executives from Google .\n\n\"What gets me excited is seeing if cricket can become a mainstream sport in the U.S.,\" said Soma Somasegar, venture capitalist and managing director at Madrona.\n\nSomasegar and Nadella are among the key owners of Seattle's cricket team, named the Orcas. They're also investors in the overall league.\n\n\"Satya [Nadella] and I have been talking about bringing cricket to America for many years,\" Somasegar told CNBC.\n\nNadella is such a die-hard cricket fan that Microsoft has a cricket field at its campus in Bellevue, Washington.\n\n\"A lot of us immigrants grew up with this sport. We'd study and watch cricket — on repeat,\" said Somasegar.\n\nIn total, nearly $850 million is currently in the process of being invested in building a viable cricket league in the U.S., people familiar with the funding said. The people asked not to be named because the funding information is private.\n\nCurrently, there are six professional teams in Major League Cricket, with each team expected to spend between roughly $75 million and $100 million over the coming years. That includes the cost of putting together a team, hiring the right talent and building stadiums where live cricket matches can be played.\n\nAdding to the fanfare is the T20 World Cup, which is being held at three locations in the U.S. and several in the West Indies throughout June.\n\nOn Thursday, in a stunning blow, the U.S. team beat Pakistan in a match held near Dallas. Fans are now counting down to the highly anticipated India vs. Pakistan match Sunday at the newly developed Nassau County stadium in New York.\n\nThe last time India and Pakistan matched up, more than 300 million people in India tuned in to watch the game, according to The New York Times.\n\nTicket reseller StubHub said the average price of tickets for Sunday's rivalry match is $1,300. The average price for the other 54 matches of the tournament is $120, the company said.\n\nVenture capitalist Anurag Jain, part owner of Major League Cricket team the San Francisco Unicorns, said the U.S. national team is primarily made up of players in the league.\n\n\"The goal is to make cricket a mainstream sport,\" said Satyan Gajwani, the vice chairman of Times Internet, the digital arm of the Times of India. He heads up Willow TV, which has the exclusive streaming rights for cricket in North America, including the T20 World Cup.\n\nGajwani is also one of the investors in the U.S. league. He said his group is going after the incredibly loyal fans from South Asia who live in the U.S.\n\n\"You essentially have five million really hard-core fans that love cricket,\" Gajwani told CNBC, referring to the South Asian diaspora in the U.S.\n\nHe added that expats from the U.K. and Australia who live in the U.S. are also big consumers of cricket.\n\nSouth Asians on average have the highest gross income of any ethnic group in the U.S., according to research from Indiaspora, a nonprofit community of Indian leaders around the world.\n\n\"That leaves a lot of discretionary income that is available to be spent on sports and entertainment,\" said M.R. Rangaswami, founder and chairman of Indiaspora.\n\nRangaswami, who said he will be at the match Sunday, acknowledged that the U.S. sports scene is tough to crack, with Americans consumed by basketball and football. He said a potential entry point could be through fans of baseball, which has some resemblance to cricket.\n\n— CNBC's Jessica Golden contributed to this report.",

[and wanted to] partner with someone outside who could really bring what we wanted to the table.\"[15]\n\nIn March 2023, the team's name, the Washington Freedom, and logo were officially revealed to the public.[16] Upon the unveiling of the team name and logo, Govil said that, \"the team's mark and colors are a perfect for a team from the nation's capital to compete on the global stage.\"[17]\n\nSeason History[edit]\n\n2023 season[edit]\n\nThe Freedom had the second overall pick of the MLC's inaugural domestic draft and selected Thunderbolts vice-captain Andries Gous as their first draft pick.[18] Dane Piedt, Mukhtar Ahmed, and Saad Ali were also all picked up by the team, with Sri Lanka international Wanindu Hasaranga (who later pulled out of the competition) and South African quick Anrich Nortje both being announced as direct signings during the draft.[19][20] Marco Jansen, Glenn Phillips, and Adam Milne were all also announced as direct signings in May.[21][22] The team then later announced it would be led by Sixers captain Moises Henriques.[23] Shortly after, they announced that they had appointed Greg Shipperd as their head coach and Dale Steyn as their bowling coach.[24] Later the following month, they announced Josh Philippe, Ben Dwarshuis, and Akeal Hosein all as additional direct signings.[25][26] Tanveer Sangha was signed in the days leading up to the tournament as a replacement for Hasaranga, while Matthew Short was added to the squad as an injury replacement for Josh Philippe.\n\nFreedom's season started with a narrow defeat against Seattle Orcas, before they bounced back in the second fixture against Texas Super Kings, winning by six runs thanks to a fantastic all-round bowling display that backed up 80 off 50 balls from Matt Short.\n\nTwo more wins would follow against LA Knight Riders and San Francisco Unicorns, before a defeat at the hands of MI New York would see Freedom forced to settle for a place in the third v fourth Eliminator fixture in Finals week. The highlight of Freedom's group stage campaign came against the Unicorns, where Saurabh Netravalkar starred with an outstanding bowling performance, claiming 6-9 as Freedom successfully defended 133.\n\n2024 Season[edit]\n\nIn December 2023, it was announced that the second season of the tournament would begin on July 4, 2024, four days after the conclusion of the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.[27]\n\nOn February 15, 2024, the retained overseas players' Akeal Hosein and Marco Jansen Retained.

He was widely credited with shaping Trent Boult and Tim Southee to become the legendary bowlers they are. He has also been the bowling coach of the Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals franchises in the Indian Premier League. Bond also was the assistant coach for the Brisbane Heat in Big Bash League 2015, working with fellow Kiwi Daniel Vettori. In March 2018, he was appointed as head coach for Sydney Thunder.\n\nOn his new role with the Seattle Orcas, Bond said, “I’m excited to be a part of Major League Cricket and the Seattle Orcas. I’m looking forward to working with all the staff and players, especially the domestic players. The United States is a fantastic destination and to be able to be a part of a tournament that’s only going to get bigger and better is fantastic.”\n\n“Shane's a fantastic addition to the Seattle Orcas coaching team\", said Sanjay Parthasarathy, operating partner and co-owner of the Seattle Orcas. \"Shane's experience as a fast bowler, plus his recent coaching experience in the IPL will be an asset to our players and the coaching staff. I want to thank Johan Botha for setting a really high bar last year, and wish him the best as the head coach for Queensland and the Brisbane Heat,\" said Sanjay Parthasarathy, Owner of the Seattle Orcas.\n\nOur young and hungry bowling side is looking forward to being guided by our cool yet experienced bowling coach and it will be safe to say our group is in extremely good hands during MLC 2024!\n\nThank You, Johan Botha, for everything you have done for Seattle Orcas and its fans.

    "body": "If you’ve been around these parts for a while, you’re aware that we’ve become cricket-pilled over the past year. So it goes when Grand Prairie has become the epicenter of the world’s second-most popular sport and its attempt to conquer America.\n\nBut as impressive as Major League Cricket was in its debut season last summer, that only set the table for what kicked off—er, bowled off?—last weekend: the T-20 World Cup, otherwise known as the biggest cricket competition on Earth. North Texas is one of three American sites hosting matches, and as Kunwar Khuldune Shahid wrote last week, it could bolster the sport’s presence domestically better than any franchised league could hope to.\n\nThat hope burns brighter than ever after a moment like yesterday, when the United States upset Pakistan in Grand Prairie Stadium. For the uninitiated, Pakistan is cricket royalty, routinely vying with subcontinental rival India for dominance of the sport. The Americans? Uh, way less so. This is the United States’ first appearance in the competition. And yet, when both teams had completed their allotment of overs, the score was level. Enter the “super over”—cricket overtime—where the United States pulled away in no small part due to the heroics of Saurabh Netravalkar, an Oracle engineer by day. The Americans have now won both of their opening matches, which means all they need is one win over India (extremely unlikely) or Ireland (much more doable) to advance to the quarter-finals.\n\nBig things could be happening for American cricket, in other words. But even if the United States doesn’t advance, they’ve already won by creating a cricket moment that will be remembered for a long, long time. Think of yesterday’s five-run victory as something like the Miracle on Ice of cricket. And every time the highlights get played, Grand Prairie will forever be the setting. Pretty cool!",
    "summary": "* The T-20 World Cup, the biggest cricket competition, has kicked off in Grand Prairie, North Texas, one of three American sites hosting matches.\n* In a historic upset, the United States defeated Pakistan, a cricket powerhouse, in a thrilling match that went into \"super over\" (cricket overtime) at Grand Prairie Stadium.\n* The US team, appearing in the competition for the first time, has now won both of their opening matches and needs only one more win to advance to the quarter-finals.\n* The victory is being hailed as a monumental moment for American cricket, likened to the \"Miracle on Ice\" in hockey, and will be remembered for a long time, with Grand Prairie as the iconic setting.",

    "date": "Wed Feb 22 00:36:49 2023",
    "body": "Steve Smith is reportedly considering a move to America to take part in a new T20 cricket league. Major League Cricket will hold its inaugural season this July, taking part in Texas and North Carolina over a three-week period.\n\nThe six-team league has been bankrolled by a number of heavyweights in India, with a reported AU$174 million invested by Microsoft boss Satya Nardella and Bollywood legend Shah Rukh Khan. Last week, Cricket NSW unveiled a partnership with Major League Cricket that will see American players come over to play in NSW Premier Cricket, and Aussies go the other way to play in the MLC.\n\n'UNUSUAL FOR HIM': Steve Smith's dressing room blow-up revealed\n\n'WHAT A JOKE': Cricket world rages at 'pathetic' Aussie women's farce\n\nCricket NSW has also entered into a partnership with the Washington DC franchise - one of six teams with a $1.5 million salary cap each season. The other teams are based in New York, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, with a number of IPL franchises engaging in similar partnerships with the US teams.\n\n“With the global cricket landscape currently undergoing significant transition, we view the United States as a market with immense growth potential,” Cricket NSW chief executive Lee Germon said last week. “Cricket NSW’s track record in high performance cricket and elite match operations is second to none and we believe we can bring a raft of experience to MLC and the Washington DC franchise in the coming years.”\n\nThe partnership will see Cricket NSW provide players and coaches to the Washington team, which could eventually include Smith. The talismanic Aussie batter won't play in the American T20 League this year due to the Ashes, but is reportedly weighing up a move to the States once he finishes his Test career.\n\nAccording to News Corp, Smith has been in talks with Major League Cricket bosses about making a cameo in 2024. The T20 World Cup will take place in the US and West Indies next year before the Major League Cricket season, opening a window for Smith to stay in the States and play.\n\n“We’ve been in touch with Steve about his plans and what he’s thinking,” MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta told News Corp. “What he’d love to do at some point is play cricket in the US as his schedule permits.\n\n“His view was that if he could make it work and if we could make it work – I know this season, he has commitments. I don’t know what the Australian calendar is next year but I believe there is enough space for him to potentially play.” Long-term … our view is that we might see a lot of him in the US.”\n\nSmith has a second home in New York and a connection to the Big Apple. He popped the question to wife Dani during a holiday there in 2017.\n\n\"The opportunities for all our players is going to be brilliant,\" Germon said. \"Steve has made no secret he loves New York. But there are also two or three other players I have spoken to who would love to play cricket in the United States.\n\n\"We will look to use the players within the Cricket NSW ecosystem to not only highlight the T20 competition and MLC, but cricket in the United States as well. Put it this way - I don't think we'll be short of players putting their hands up.\"\n\nSteve Smith set to finish cricket career in America?\n\nSpeaking last year, Smith flagged the possibility that he might finish his career in America. “There’s obviously leagues popping up everywhere around the world now, and I think you’ll probably see more players in the back end of their career going down that route, so it’s potentially something I’ll look at in the future,” Smith told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n“The US has been a market that cricket’s been trying to get into for some time. So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nAnd it might come sooner rather than later, with Smith revealing in January that he wasn't sure how much longer he wants to play Test cricket. \"We'll see. I'm enjoying it at the moment,\" he told reporters during the SCG Test. \"I really can't say how long I'll play for. I'm not sure.\n\n\"I'll take it one tour at a time, just enjoy it, enjoy training and trying to get better as well. Whilst I'm doing that, I'm happy playing but I don't know how long that'll last.\"\n\nHe later hosed down speculation he is on the verge of walking away from international cricket, but he's clearly thinking about what his future looks like.",

    "body": "The Knight Riders Group (KRG), backed by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside actor Juhi Chawla and businessman Jay Mehta, is investing in a 10,000-capacity cricket stadium near Los Angeles.\n\nLocated at a 15-acre land parcel in Great Park, Irvine, Southern California, some 40 miles from downtown Los Angeles, the plan is driven by Major League Cricket (MLC). The org has revealed that an exclusive negotiating agreement with the city of Irvine to move forward with lease negotiations and design approvals has been approved. The investment in the stadium is likely to be in the range of $30 million, Variety understands.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nBollywood Superstar Shah Rukh Khan Teams With Hitmaker Rajkumar Hirani for 'Dunki'\n\nShane Warne, Australian Cricket Legend, Dies at 52\n\nBBC Studios Sets Content Deal With India's MX Player - Global Bulletin\n\nKRG are owners of the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the lucrative Indian Premier League cricket tournament and Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nThe stadium, which will have the capacity to be expanded, will be designed by architects HKS and will be home to MLC’s Southern California-based franchise, in the heart of one of the largest cricket-loving populations in the U.S., including an estimated 100,000 cricket fans with a further 200,000 more located in Los Angeles County. Two Minor League Cricket teams, the SoCal Lashings and Hollywood Master Blasters, along with local adult and youth leagues in the area provide a base of grassroots support for cricket in the region.\n\nThe stadium plans include state-of-the-art training facilities, locker rooms, luxury suites, dedicated parking, concessions, field lighting and an international-grade pitch to meet International Cricket Council (ICC) accreditation. There are two major events that the proposed stadium, if completed in time, could host – the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024, which will be co-hosted by the U.S. and the West Indies, and if cricket is included in the 2028 Olympic Games to be held in Los Angeles, which the ICC is bidding for. U.S.A Cricket is also expected to bid for future men’s and women’s World Cup tournaments.\n\n“Our investment in MLC in America is based on our belief in the exciting future of cricket in the U.S.A and is well aligned to our strategy of establishing Knight Riders as a global brand in T20 cricket,” said Khan, per an MLC press release. “Plans to build a world class cricket stadium in the greater Los Angeles area is exciting for us and MLC. This will no doubt have a transformational impact for cricket in one of the world’s most iconic metropolitan destinations.”\n\nSameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders, MLC, added: “Great Park’s position as a hub for community recreation and its array of first-class sports facilities makes it an ideal location for the addition of a venue serving the local cricket-loving community and the broader Greater Los Angeles region with major international cricket events set to take place there.”\n\nBest of Variety\n\nMolly Shannon's Memoir 'Hello Molly' Is Already an Instant Bestseller on Amazon\n\n2022 Primetime Emmys Awards Season Calendar: The Governors Balls are Back After Two Years\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney Plus in April 2022\n\nSign up for Variety’s Newsletter.

    "body": "Alex Carey is the latest big-name Australia signing for the USA's Major League Cricket, with the men's Test team keeper-batter to turn out for Los Angeles Knight Riders when the T20 tournament begins next month.\n\nCarey becomes the 20th Australia player to join the second season of the US League which immediately follows the current ICC T20 World Cup being staged in the USA and Caribbean.\n\nCricket in America received a significant boost overnight when USA scored an historic super-over victory against 2022 Cup finalists Pakistan at Dallas, only the team's second success against a Test nation following their previous T20 win against Ireland in 2021.\n\nCarey will join fellow national representatives Adam Zampa and SA teammate Spencer Johnson at the affiliate franchise of this year's Indian Premier League champions Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nThe LA team will play their seven minor round MLC matches at grounds in Dallas, Texas and Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nBefore signing the deal, the 32-year-old was one of the few members of Australia's current Test outfit not to be playing competitive cricket during the southern winter.\n\nOnly opening batter Usman Khawaja is taking a full off-season sabbatical, although the reigning ICC men's Test Cricketer of the Year is also in the US as Prime Video's ambassador for their coverage of the T20 World Cup.\n\nCarey's Test counterparts Mitchell Marsh, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head and Cameron Green are all members of Australia's Cup contingent, while Marnus Labuschagne and Nathan Lyon are playing county cricket in the UK.\n\nSteve Smith is the only other member of the XI that took the field for Australia's most recent Test against New Zealand last March not currently playing, but he will be part of MLC starting on July 5 with Washington Freedom.\n\nSuch is the burgeoning appeal of the three-week MLC competition, it was announced earlier this week that Australia Test captain Pat Cummins had signed a four-year deal with Cricket Victoria-aligned San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nCarey, who will join the LA outfit ahead of the pre-season training camp in Florida starting June 28, had previously indicated a preference for returning to the UK's domestic T20 Vitality Blast tournament that kicked off last month.\n\nHowever, the timing of MLC coupled with its shorter playing window – which ensures minimal family disruption for Carey's wife Eloise and their children Louis and Clementine – made the US option a better fit.\n\n\"I've never been to America so it will be great to try the T20 league there,\" Carey told cricket.com.au today.\n\n\"I'm grateful and lucky it fell into place.\n\n\"I had interest late last year about heading over to a couple of teams in England.\n\n\"But it wasn't quite the right time for me to make a decision on what to do, so I left it a bit longer and those teams filled up.\"\n\nDespite the abuse and harassment directed at Carey and his family following his stumping of England's Jonny Bairstow in last year's second Ashes Test at Lord's – as documented in Prime Video's 'The Test' – he maintains an affinity for the UK.\n\nPrior to making his Test debut in the 2021-22 Ashes series in Australia, Carey played with Sussex in the UK county competition and is keen to return to Britain for another stint should his playing schedule allow.\n\n\"I definitely want to head back to England and play eventually,\" he said.\n\n\"I love it, and I love playing cricket over there.\n\n\"We'll see how it all plays out but I definitely see myself playing some county or T20 cricket there in the future.\"\n\nAustralians in the 2024 MLC\n\nLA Knight Riders: Adam Zampa, Spencer Johnson, Alex Carey\n\nMI New York: Tim David\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Pat Cummins, Josh Inglis, Matt Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Brody Couch (domestic signing)\n\nSeattle Orcas: Nathan, Ellis, Lance Morris, Cameron Gannon (domestic signing)\n\nTexas Super Kings: Aaron Hardie, Cameron Stevenson (domestic signing)",

He was not picked in the last MLC draft.\n\n\"When I wasn't selected in the Major League, I just took it as a stepping stone in the journey,\" he said.\n\n\"I would have loved to get drafted, so it goes sometimes. Hopefully tonight's innings will probably open the eyes of those who don't know me or USA cricket.\n\n\"We have great players here and that we have a lot of talent here and are willing to play at the highest level for sure.\"\n\nSet a target of 195, USA stuttered initially, losing opener Steven Taylor for zero in the second ball of the innings, and were 42/2 after 6.3 overs.\n\nBut Jones had other ideas as he came up with a counter-attacking innings to script a memorable win with as many as 14 balls to spare.\n\n\"I don't think it is easy to put it into words. We know Canada come hard against us since it is a big rivalry. Happy to take the team over the line,\" said Jones.\n\nJones smashed 10 sixes on the day, the second most in a T20 World Cup innings behind West Indian Chris Gayle's 11 against England in 2016.\n\n\"Sometimes as a cricketer, you could go a bit under the radar if you have a few low scores,\" Jones said. \"I always back myself and know that I am capable of performing at every level. happy that I came out on top and won the game for USA.\n\n\"Hope it opens the eyes of some people around the world that I am good enough to play T20 cricket.\n\n\"I believe in myself, I work hard and I just use as motivation. I know that I'm good enough to play at the highest level, and whenever given the opportunity, I'll do my best for sure.\n\n\"When I went out to bat tonight, I just saw it as another game to fight for me and bring my team as close as possible to the line, and if we get as close as possible to the line and over the line, it's great for the team.\"\n\nDespite losing two early wickets, Jones said he was confident of chasing down the total with their long batting lineup. He got a helping hand from Andries Gous, who made 65 off 46 balls in a 131-run partnership with Jones.\n\n\"With our batting line-up, knew anything under 200 is chaseable. Outfield and pitch were good and we knew that,\" said Jones after USA's highest run chase in T20Is.\"\n\nUSA will next take on Pakistan at the same venue on Thursday and play India in ten days' time, while Canada face Ireland in New York on Friday.\n\nJones said they will continue to play fearless cricket.\n\n\"We just want to keep winning as much as possible, of course we can't win every single game for the rest of our lives.\n\n\"I don't think our plan is going to change much. We want to play fearless cricket, we want to play hard cricket, we want to play smart cricket.\n\n\"We are going into the Pakistan game with the same mindset. We want to play fearless cricket, regardless of who we play against.\"\n\nAll praise for Jones, USA skipper Monank Patel said: \"We've always known, he has the game. He played fearless cricket and backing his shots. It was clean hitting.\n\n\"We want to continue the way we are playing. Don't want to change our fearless cricket whether we play Pakistan or India.\"\n\nCalling it a team effort, Patel said: \"The way we've been playing against Canada in previous series, I thought it was a whole team effort.\"",

    "date": "Fri Jun  7 15:52:00 2024",
    "body": "Synopsis\n\nIn 2013, Nosthush Kenjige, disillusioned after failing to break into Karnataka's cricket scene despite rigorous training, returned to the US with a biotechnology degree. His passion for cricket reignited in New York, leading to his rise in the USA national team and impressive performances in Major League Cricket. Key to his journey was catching Dwayne Bravo's eye at the US Open T20. Kenjige now stars for the USA, notably taking crucial wickets in their stunning T20 World Cup victory over Pakistan.\n\nBack in 2013, Nosthush Kenjige shacked up in his PG room close to the CBD here, sulking. Then a 22-year-old, Kenjige was nowhere near fulfilling his dream of becoming a professional cricketer. A rigorous training at the Karnataka Institute of Cricket (KIOC) notwithstanding, Kenjige, one of the stars in USA's stunning win over Pakistan in the ongoing T20 World Cup, was not even close to breaking into the state cricketing eco-system.\n\nLatest from the Election Surpirse\n\nLok Sabha Elections: Track all the political movements Live\n\nThe fine print of Das & Co's first post poll policy\n\nShah, Nadda hash out deals with allies as Jun 9 looms\n\nFilled with disillusion, Kenjige, a US citizen by birth, returned to his mother nation armed with a degree in bio-technology from Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering.\n\nHis passion for cricket was not extinct but remained dormant as Kenjige explored a career in medical equipment inspection in New York.\n\n\"It was a phase I was merely floating around without much aim. But a year so later, I joined Columbia Cricket Club in NY, and that sort of reignited my desire to pursue cricket,\" said Kenjige, who was here on a personal visit a few months back.\n\nIrfan Sait, his early coach at the KIOC, said Kenjige made a timely return to the USA.\n\n\"He was talented for sure. He used to put in a lot of hard work at nets and played in the state league too. But as it happens here, thousands of cricketers want to break into the Karnataka state cricket team. Some will make it, some won't and Nosh, unfortunately, could not make it but that was no reflection of his talent or work ethics.\n\n\"When he decided to go back to the USA, I thought it was a good move and thought he may get to play at a higher level there,\" said Sait.\n\nIt was not a wrong assumption either. Kenjige rose through the ranks quite quickly in the next few years, earning a central contract with the USA national team and signed up for MI New York in the Major League Cricket.\n\nIn fact, the left-arm spinner was quite impressive for his side taking six wickets from as many matches at an outstanding economy rate of 5.76. His wickets included some top batters like Martin Guptill.\n\n\"The experience really helped me because it improved my confidence of standing up to bigger players and occasions,\" said Kenjige.\n\nBut there was a stroke of luck for Kenjige as former West Indian player Dwayne Bravo took notice of him at the US Open T20 tournament, an annual cricket exhibition event in Florida where some top cricketers from around the world participate.\n\nAli Khan, the USA teammate of Kenjige, too was picked by Bravo, who has an excellent eye for talent, during that tournament at the Cricketplex resort.\n\nSometimes minute moments can irrevocably change the course of someone's career or life and Kenjige admitted this as his turning point.\n\n\"I never thought that would change the whole course. It was a good spell but never thought that it would propel me into a bigger league.\n\n\"I had to do 800 hours of community service to be eligible to play for the USA, including teaching young cricketers, but all that effort was worth it when I made my national debut,\" said Kenjige.\n\nThe big day came in 2019 when Kenjige stepped on to the field against UAE, and since then he has played 40 ODIs and seven T20Is, including the one against Pakistan in New York on Thursday.\n\nKenjige grabbed the wickets of Usman Khan, Azam Khan and Shadab Khan to break Pakistan's charge in the middle overs.\n\nThe 33-year-old might have foreseen his glory day when he spoke about the need to exploit the chances.\n\n\"Coming from an Associate team, we don't often get chances to play against big teams. So, we need to ensure to grab those chances with both hands once they come our way. It's a tight situation but that's the challenging part for players like us,\" noted Kenjige, who was the USA's highest wicket-taker in the ICC Qualifiers last year.\n\nOne more challenge will come Kenjige's way on June 12 when USA face India, the country of his parents Pradeep and Keerthi.\n\n\"During those years (in Karnataka), I was ready to move away from cricket. But destiny has taken me to a different route, but one that I always wanted to travel,\" he signed off.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Sikkim Election Results News,Arunachal Pradesh Election Result News Election Results News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Sikkim Election Results News,Arunachal Pradesh Election Result News Election Results News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless",

    "body": "The USA had played the first international cricket match in history, back in 1844, but the sport had faded away after the First World War. Of late, however, there has been a conscious effort to make the sport popular in the nation again – through the Major League Cricket, the 2024 T20 World Cup, and a return of cricket in the Olympics after 128 years, in 2028 at Los Angeles.\n\nThe USA are co-hosting the 2024 T20 World Cup along with two-time champions West Indies. Eight matches, including the marquee India-Pakistan clash, will be played at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, while the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas and the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill will host four games each.\n\n“I’m unbelievably excited about going and watching a game in New York because I've just come back from the IPL where everybody is talking about you know the biggest game in cricket happening in New York,” said Eoin Morgan in conversation with Mel Farrell on the Wisden Cricket Weekly podcast.\n\nPart of the ICC commentary team at the World Cup, Morgan spoke about New York hosting a match featuring India and his former team, Ireland: “It’s going to be great to see India playing against the Men in Green, Ireland. I’m going to be there at that game as a fan, not as a commentator, and there are a few of my friends attending as well.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a great spectacle and a huge opportunity, when you think of the MLC last year being a success and sort of raising awareness about the opportunity that cricket could pose in the States.\n\n“You get a lot of people in England saying, ‘Well, do you think it will work?’ The answer is it’s already worked. I’m sorry, we’re already late to the party. When you have players having to choose between their home tournament and a tournament abroad, a player will always pick his home tournament if they you know if the opportunity is right. If the contract is right, there’s not one person that I’ve ever played cricket with that would turn down a big opportunity at home over something else.\"\n\nThe MLC's pull as a tournament is expanding. Former England opener Jason Roy will play there instead of the second half of the T20 Blast group stage (the English domestic T20 competition), while several high profile Australians are likely to compete in the second edition of the American franchise competition as well.\n\n“So, you have to give credit where credit is due. They’ve launched a good tournament [MLC] in the lead into this year’s World Cup. Over the last four months, we’ve seen social media reaction of the Nassau County international Cricket Stadium, which is just amazing. You really do get the impression following American sport in general that if they commit to something, they are all in. I get the feeling about that this World Cup is no different. So yeah, it will be brilliant.”",
    "summary": "* The MLC is a key factor in promoting cricket in the USA, along with the 2024 T20 World Cup and cricket's return to the Olympics in 2028.\n* The MLC has been successful in raising awareness about cricket in the States, with former England captain Eoin Morgan stating that \"it's already worked\".\n* The tournament's popularity is growing, with high-profile players like former England opener Jason Roy choosing to play in the MLC over the English domestic T20 competition, the T20 Blast.\n* Several Australian players are also likely to participate in the second edition of the MLC.\n* The success of the MLC is seen as a positive development for cricket in the USA, with Morgan praising the tournament's launch and the country's commitment to the sport.",

Now the big-time event in cricket, the T20 world cup has arrived in the USA which along with West Indies are hosting this marquee championship this time. Not that cricket is new to America, the Major League Cricket is there and indeed India and West Indies had played a few matches of their 2016 and 2023 T20 series there. But for a country which has hosted the Olympics multiple times and even the World Cup football (1994), this will be a first, a World Cup cricket on its soil. What better indication than that, thanks to the T20 version, cricket is truly becoming a global event if not still comparable yet to soccer. But the big march has begun. Indeed, the USA would look at this major championship as one more effort to strengthen the interest for this sport in the country and there is another reason. The 2028 edition of the Olympics is to be hosted by the USA and cricket (men and women) is one of the disciplines planned.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nThat much for USA’s interest and enthusiasm but for the cricket lovers around the world it is another occasion to delve into the thrills of the bat and ball that T20 always promises. The just concluded IPL, a hugely accepted event, perhaps world over, gave a sample of what cricket excitement can be all about. The venue now changes to a larger locale spread over two countries, one, the West Indies a traditionally big power in the sport. Picturesque settings are in place to match the high-quality cricket expected with around a third of the 55 matches scheduled in three cities in America. Twenty teams are in the fray including the three debutants, host USA, Canada and Uganda. All three gained acceptance by dint of their fine performances. USA, automatic entrant as host, had last month carved out a 2-1 win against Bangladesh in a T20 series, Canada in the warm up campaign had a significant win over Nepal while Uganda gained notice after finishing second in the T20 world cup Africa qualifier. What will be their influence on the big stage amidst the seasoned campaigners will be one area of curious interest for the cricket aficionados.\n\nWhatever flashes that the newcomers or lesser-known nations can throw up in the course of the championship it still becomes difficult to see anything beyond the fancied teams to make the super eight phase, where starts the true fight for supremacy. Here again, considering the way T20 can surprise and shock, there can never be a true prediction of who would lift the coveted Cup. Evidence of this can be seen in the way results had panned out from the time (2007) this Cup was instituted. Since the inaugural edition was held in South Africa, six teams had won the title with West Indies and England the only ones to lift the Cup twice each.\n\nAll said and done, close matches should be the feature with some big hitting the highlight. Already USA gave a glimpse of its capability with a convincing win over Canada in the championship opener. USA’s Aaron Jones must have been the toast of the home team supporters with his free-wheeling unbeaten 40-ball 94 that had ten hits over the fence! That probably sets the tone as every day from now on surely would promise many more spectacles of this kind and more. Perhaps the initial look out for fans would be the much publicised India-Pakistan encounter. An assured high voltage drama when the two face each other, this time too it should not any less. One thing it can be said with certainty there would be more eyeballs for this than perhaps any other contest!\n\nThis is not to put in the shade the abilities of the others like Australia, England, New zealand, West Indies, Sri Lanka and South Africa. India fans will in particular not forget what Australia can do having seen it grab the ODI world cup title in Ahmedabad last year. Having recorded ten straight wins before coming to the final, many had expected a home team triumph. The huge stadium was filled to capacity but in the end it was Travis Head who did the impossible, ensuring a grand victory for Australia and leaving the fans dumbstruck. Head who was a delight in the IPL will be there for more heroics. Not that India does not have its own heroes but the day’s performance that will be the key to everything around success. Still India has an additional pressure of being ranked number one even if history has not been too kind to it here. Except for winning the inaugural edition in 2007, India has hardly sparkled barring finishing runner up to Sri Lanka in 2014.\n\nMuch interest surrounds West Indies, considering the talents from this country have had good time in franchise cricket the world over. Besides, West Indies in the run up to the World cup had come up with a convincing 3-0 win over South Africa in a T20 series. That should have done the side a world of good in confidence. There is then much to look forward to even as the USA settles down to becoming an important centre for this sport in the seasons to come. Good for cricket, as they say.",

Furthermore, several Australian stars like Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head will be featured in MLC season 2.\n\nSpeaking of the same, MLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan recently came forward to reflect on how huge it is for the entire tournament to have signed such big names as Pat Cummins and Glenn Maxwell.\n\n\"Signing a world-class player like Pat Cummins is a testament to the calibre of talent the league is attracting, underscoring our global impact and the success of the inaugural season,” Srinivasan was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.\n\n\"It elevates the level of competition fans will get to see and experience on home soil and showcases our commitment to bringing the top-tier players in the world to play in America's very own league,” he added.",

According to the former English player, the Major League Cricket (MLC) has received funding of 100 million sterling pounds from private investors such as Microsoft and Adobe.\n\nQuote\n\nPlunkett’s words\n\nPlunkett, who recently signed a three-year deal with Minor League Cricket’s Philadelphians, said, “It’s go big or go home. That is how they do stuff in America. And with the money that is behind this, it is going to be massive. I think it will explode.” The pacer who represented England in 89 ODIs and 22 T20Is also added that the upcoming T20 league will attract legendary cricketers from every corner of the world.\n\nInformation\n\nCricket in the USA\n\nCricket is a fast-emerging sport in the United States of America. Next year, the country will host its first-ever domestic T20 league and in 2024, the States will co-host the ICC T20 World Cup along with West Indies. Shahrukh Khan-owned Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders have acquired one of the six franchises. The six teams will represent six cities, such as Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC.\n\nPlunkett, who shifted to the States last year after retiring from English cricket, also added, “Americans want to watch the best and I think we can attract them. I think they will definitely jump on board when they see how big it is. With how many people love cricket here and the way Americans put on a show, you will get packed-out crowds. Hopefully, you will get people like Jonny Bairstow, Andre Russell, and all of these guys coming across to play. It is a lot of people’s dream to play the sport in America.”\n\nAccording to a report, the MLC is constructing six venues that are in line with the standards of the International Cricket Council (ICC). “The first will open in Grand Prairie, Dallas County next year and will be the main venue for MLC’s inaugural season with a permanent capacity of up to 9,000, increased to 12,000 with temporary seating,” the report added.",

He brings a wealth of expertise to the group, and I’m looking forward to leaning on him as a mentor when it comes to game strategy and leadership.”\n\n“After experiencing the inaugural MLC season, I have high expectations for 2024 both on and off the pitch, and will be fully focused on delivering success to the growing Unicorns fanbase – once I’ve done all I can to take the USA as far as I can in the current T20 World Cup.”\n\nThe former multi-format representative for New Zealand has made a name for himself with a powerful striking style that once saw Anderson hold the record for fastest ODI hundred in just 36 balls. He has since gone on to earn 38 International T20 caps, averaging 26.41 with a strike rate over 130, and represent various T20 franchises including the IPL’s Royal Challengers Bangalore and Big Bash League’s Hobart Hurricanes.\n\nShane Watson, Head Coach of the San Francisco Unicorns, added: “Corey has been pivotal in shaping this franchise’s DNA since the inaugural season last year. He is a natural leader on and off the field and has an immense amount of experience at the highest level, which translates perfectly into leading the San Francisco Unicorn’s this season.\n\n“I am super excited about building a very successful coach-captain relationship with him.”\n\nPat Cummins, Australia Test and ODI Captain and recent Unicorns signing, said: “The culture of the Unicorns group, put into place by the likes of Corey and Shane, is one of the reasons why I’m here. As a USA international and fan favorite, he’s a deserving captain and I can’t wait to play for him and the rest of the team in July.”\n\nCorey Anderson will lead the Unicorns out in his first match as captain against the LA Knight Riders on July 7, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium, near Dallas, TX – the same venue that saw USA edge out Pakistan – featuring a team packed full of global superstars, including recent signing Pat Cummins, NZ batter Finn Allen, and Pakistani pace bowler Haris Rauf.",

    "date": "Tue Jun 11 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "The BCCI should use the American Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise to give talented but unproven young players the chance to hone their skills in foreign conditions\n\nAmericans are not fans of cricket. They do not understand it and see it as slow, complicated (how do you score again?), and somewhat effete (so what is it with the preppy sweaters). So the game has been confined to purely amateur cricket leagues in cities as far flung as Los Angeles, Birmingham Alabama, and of course New York. Yet America is a globalized nation with large Diasporas from the cricket playing world. Also, the clever marketing of the International Cricket Conference (ICC) has led to the creation of a domestic T20 League that is backed by wealthy Indians like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and has teams owned by franchises in the IPL as well as a team owned by the Australians. While this is promising, the question is can the league succeed and the answer is an unqualified yes! There are several reasons for this.\n\nFirst, the success of cricket lies in the fact that the Indian diaspora, much like the nation of India, could drive it to being a financial success. The cricket crazy Indian diaspora has the highest median household income of $126,000 in the USA while the median American household income is $74,580. This gives the Indian diaspora both purchasing power and consuming power and this used to be reflected in the way Bollywood stars were generously feted in the USA or in the way Narendrabhai Modi was greeted in the lavish Howdy Modi event. Indians have never had a sporting event to call their own but with the T20 league they do.\n\nThey are also good at organization. In Toronto, the Indians took over the local city league from the West Indians—who ran it as a social event—and professionalized it to the extent that Canada now has a team in the T20 World Cup. The Indian diaspora will effectively market the matches, make sure facilities are up to par, and provide both the players and the local fan base to support the game. Players like Saurabh Netravalkar, who works at Oracle and moonlights as a cricketer for the USA, are good examples of the ability to bring in local talent.\n\nSecondly, cricket will never be the multi-million Dollar sport American football, baseball, and basketball are but it could provide a semi-amateurish wage potential for players who are most likely playing for the love of the game. In this sense, Major League Soccer (MLS) is instructive since the lowest salaries in the league are around $60,000, a far cry from the multi-million Dollar packages athletes in the traditionally “American” sports receive. Yet, despite the lower wages, soccer is now wildly popular in the US and games are played to packed stadiums.\n\nA league that starts off modestly and systematically builds up a fan base and local traditions—where fans support their city team much in the way an older generation of Indians supported Mumbai, Delhi, and Karnataka—has a good chance of happening. But what will primarily drive the success of the new league is the ability to bring in marquee players who have name recognition across the cricketing world. Again the MLS is the guide for this because it brought in aging stars like Kaka, Thierry Henry, David Beckham, Wayne Rooney, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic to boost attendances. Henry, Beckham, and Ibrahimovic in the off-season continued to play for premier European clubs. Thus aging draws like Chris Gayle and Andre Russell would boost attendance and viewership in the US. But the most important tool for success will be the cooperation of the BCCI.\n\nThe BCCI has jealously guarded its properties and the value of the IPL by not allowing marquee Indian players like Kohli, Bumrah, and Sharma to play in foreign leagues like the Australian Big Bash. But sending second tier players and even famous retired players to play in the US would be a great hit with the crowds and jump start the league. If, for example, Mahendra Singh Dhoni finally retires from the IPL, he would be a hugely popular draw playing for the Texas Super Knights who are partly owned by the Chennai Super Kings. And if the way Sachin Tendulkar was mobbed by adoring fans at the India-Pakistan game in New York is any indication, Mumbai Indians should ask the great man to play a few games for their New York franchise (for the record, Sachin, while long retired, would still be among the best players in the league).\n\nTo put this in perspective, MLS brought in Lionel Messi and it was a masterstroke for all the games he plays in are sold out and you cannot buy a ticket under $200. Tendulkar, Dhoni, Sehwag (if interested) would draw large crowds and seal the future of the game. Nor do they need to play for the entire season but, instead, show up for a few games to whet the appetite of the fans.\n\nFurther, the BCCI should use the American Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise to give talented but unproven young players the chance to hone their skills in foreign conditions. Bob Woolmer used to say that South Asian cricketers are flat track bullies who do not perform as well in foreign conditions. While not strictly true, the fact remains that both Indian bowlers and batsmen could benefit from playing in different conditions and on a tricky wicket like the one in New York. Sending maybe two young cricketers to each team in the MLC would both help the league and improve the skills of these players.\n\nTo sum up, this is a great chance to bring the game to the US, provide joy to cricket crazy fans, and to create a sporting league that is integrated into the IPL. Moreover, the advertising opportunities for Indian firms cannot be overlooked since this would be a cheap venue and way to attract eyeballs in the United States. Put simply, this is not an opportunity to pass up.\n\n(Amit Gupta is a Senior Advisor on Peace and Conflict Resolution to the Forum of Federations, Ottawa.

    "summary": "* The MLC tournament has the potential to succeed in the US, driven by the Indian diaspora who have a high median household income and purchasing power.\n* The Indian diaspora is expected to market the matches, provide facilities, and support the game, just like they did in Toronto, where they took over the local city league and professionalized it.\n* The league can attract local talent, like Saurabh Netravalkar, who works at Oracle and plays cricket for the USA.\n* The tournament can start modestly and build up a fan base, with marquee players like Chris Gayle and Andre Russell, who can boost attendance and viewership.\n* The cooperation of the BCCI is crucial for the success of the league, and sending second-tier players and retired players to play in the US can be a great hit with the crowds.\n* The BCCI should use the MLC franchise to give talented but unproven young players the chance to hone their skills in foreign conditions, which can benefit Indian bowlers and batsmen.\n* The league can provide a semi-amateurish wage potential for players, similar to Major League Soccer (MLS), and can create a sporting event that is integrated into the IPL.\n* The advertising opportunities for Indian firms cannot be overlooked, as this would be a cheap venue to attract eyeballs in the United States.",

Australian cricket star Adam Zampa has attracted instant headlines for America’s fledgling Major League Cricket competition - and it had nothing to do with what he did with bat or ball.\n\nThe extroverted Aussie leg spinner instead caused a storm with his choice of number on the back of his LA Knight Riders’ playing shirt. Zampa opted for number 420 - presumably as a reference to marijuana - for the match against the Texas Super Kings.\n\n'SURPRISED': Alex Carey's telling response to Jonny Bairstow Ashes outrage\n\nCLASSIC: Mitchell Starc's hilarious Alyssa Healy reveal amid Ashes battle\n\nHUGE: Michael Neser puts Ashes selectors on notice in astonishing feat\n\nThe origins of 420 are a little murky, with one suggestion it was the police radio call used for any dope related offence in the US. Another explanation is it’s the room number the Grateful Dead insisted on staying in during their touring days.\n\nA more plausible reason is it’s the codename a bunch of schoolboys gave their group in 1971 after discovering a marijuana crop in San Francisco. The boys would meet after school at 4:20pm, hence the tag.\n\nEvery year around the world, marijuana enthusiasts meet on April 20 (4/20 on the American calendar) to celebrate their love of weed and push for its decriminalisation. Zampa has not publicly declared why he chose shirt number 420 but fans have decided it’s his way of bringing a bit of life and colour to the American tournament.\n\nAdam Zampa shirt number takes internet by storm\n\nIt certainly became a major talking point. Fans from around the cricket world took to social media to speculate about Zampa’s motives for using 420.\n\nAdam Zampa remains one of cricket's quirkiest characters\n\nThe 31-year-old has long done things his way, refusing to conform to cricket’s straight-laced ways. He lives on a farm on the NSW far north coast - away from the major cricketing centres - and long ago adopted a vegan diet.\n\nHe is passionate about environmental and social issues and a keen advocate for animal welfare. Now it appears he is lending his support to another popular cause.\n\nZampa’s LA Knight Riders are co-owned by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and boast premier West Indian players Sunil Narime, Andre Russell, South African Rilee Rossouw and New Zealander Lockie Ferguson among their playing ranks.",

    "body": "Cricket seems to be winning big time in the USA, as Australia’s ODI and Test captain Pat Cummins has signed for San Franciso Unicorns for the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC). With the franchise sharing a strategic relationship with Victoria’s first-class set-up, Cummins’ signing is a bumper one, with the 31-year-old likely to lead the side following Aaron Finch’s retirement.\n\nUp and running since the New Zealand Tour earlier in February, Cummins would ply his trade in USA’s franchise-based T20 League, starting almost five days after the end of the ongoing 2024 T20 World Cup in the Americas.\n\nAlmost new to franchise cricket, Cummins enjoyed his stint with SunRisers Hyderabad in IPL 2024, where he led the team to the finals in his maiden attempt as a T20 skipper.\n\nALSO READ: ‘It’s not me...’: Gautam Gambhir on replacing Rahul Dravid as Indian team head coach\n\nCummins' signing reflects MLC’s growing eminence in world cricket just after one season and how far it's willing to go. Cummins will join some of the Aussie A-Listers like Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith and Jake Fraser McGurk, with T20I captain Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis and others like to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, the second season of MLC will begin on July 5, with defending champions MI New York taking on Seattle Orcas in the repeat of last year’s final and Texas Super Kings facing LA Knight Riders in a home game later in the doubleheader.\n\nCummins’ rise\n\nAustralia’s bowling mainstay since the start of the last decade, Pat Cummins, took over the captaincy in the longer formats in 2022, guiding Australia to massive heights since.\n\nIn 2023, Cummins-led Australia beat India in the second World Test Championship (WTC) Final at the Oval before they drew the away Ashes 2-2.\n\nA few months later in the 50-over World Cup in India, Cummins guided Australia to their record sixth title, beating the hosts by six wickets in the final in Ahmedabad. The seamer had a cheerful home season before joining SRH as their new captain.\n\nLeading for the first time in T20 cricket, Cummins didn’t put a foot wrong and led his team to their first final in over five years. Although they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders in the title match, Cummins earned praise from all across for his daring and smart captaincy.\n\nThe lanky fast bowler will play in the 2024 T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the USA. Australia is placed in Group B alongside old foes England, Scotland, Namibia and Oman.",

    "body": "As administrator Justin Geale assessed the arrival of a jewel of world cricket to the USA, he declared “the train has left” Grand Central Station when it comes to establishing the sport in the United States.\n\nThe Canberra-born Geale is the tournament director for Major League Cricket, which was granted List A status by the International Cricket Council in May, and is among the Australians featuring heavily in the expansion of the sport across America.\n\nAn historic summer in the US, which will host a World Cup for the first time in conjunction with the West Indies, is a significant step forward in what shapes as an important decade for cricket in America — a nation that already boasts a rich and eventful cricketing history.\n\nWatch selected NRL & AFL games, along with every F1 race live in 4K on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial today\n\nSTAR IS BORN: New York-born hero powers USA to historic opening win\n\n‘MUST BE BETTER’: Fallen giants in massive World Cup scare as minnows announce arrival\n\nThe USA will host 16 of the 55 matches in the T20 World Cup ahead of the second edition of MLC — featuring Australians Steve Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell — which runs throughout July and involves six franchises across the country.\n\nAs important as hosting a World Cup is, the biggest step forward for cricket in the US is its inclusion in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, according to Geale.\n\n“The LA28 Olympics is going to be huge for cricket. For the first time, what that does is open up different funding avenues in terms of America, so there are great opportunities there,” he told foxsports.com.au.\n\n“It’s no surprise we’ve got a franchise base (in Los Angeles). That’s a key market for us to get going, because they’re going to play cricket at the Olympics.\n\n“I think it’s all going to happen together over here. The MLC is really important. The minor leagues are important. The US national team is getting stronger and being competitive, which is really important.\n\n“The bigger play here, though, is to make cricket a more mainstream sport is to get into colleges and high schools. It’s a phenomenal setup here in terms of high school and college sports.\n\n“(But) that’s a much longer term play and that’s going to take all main stakeholders from the ICC, USA Cricket and the MLC pulling together.\n\n“But I think that momentum, if you look at the successful MLC launch last year (and hopefully) a strong follow up season on the back of a World Cup, and the US getting stronger into LA28, I think it shows that cricket can work here.”\n\nCRICKET? IN AMERICA? WHY HISTORY SUGGESTS THE WHITE BALL GAME CAN FLOURISH IN THE USA\n\n“A tiger? In Africa?”\n\nThe Monty Python quote sprang to mind when the location of this year’s T20 World Cup was confirmed by the ICC in November, 2021.\n\n“A Cricket World Cup? In America?”\n\nThe tournament serves as a litmus test — America has been earmarked as one of cricket’s growing markets due to its financial power and thriving South Asian immigrant community.\n\nIt is hoped the World Cup will broaden awareness and have a similar impact to what was achieved with soccer in America following the FIFA World Cup in 1994.\n\nThe ICC estimates there are around 30 million cricket fans in the US and the organisation is embarking on a mission to rebuild the sport to mainstream status in a country it considers a sleeping giant.\n\nCricket Victoria’s chief executive Nick Cummins noted the prospective fanbase in the US after his state affiliated with the San Francisco Unicorns ahead of the MLC launch last year.\n\n“It’s not something you would expect to say about America, but there is a significant cricket-supporting population in the country,” he said last year.\n\n“If we just focus on the Bay Area with the Unicorns, there are about 500,000 South Asians interested in cricket just in the Bay Area – so that’s Tasmania. So you’ve got a potential cricket fan base of Tasmania in just one city.”\n\nIt is a point made by Geale, whose organisation is looking to expand the number of cricket venues across the US for a competition currently hosted at grounds in Texas and North Carolina.\n\n“We don’t shy away from the fact that we have an existing fan base here which is really massive by world standards,” he said.\n\n“That is first or second generation (and) there is a strong Indian, Pakistan, Afghani and Sri Lankan population. We break down to an Australian, English, West Indian population on the East Coast.\n\n“The expat market is huge. It’s a very well educated market over here, particularly in the Asian markets, because they have come here to go to college, or their parents have come here, and they are second or third generation now. So we have that fan base already.\n\n“We need to tap into that properly and not shy away from that. So if you come to a ground, you will get a samosa, but you’re also going to get a hot dog as well. The bigger play is to make it more mainstream.\n\n“Do we need to be Major League Baseball? No, absolutely not. But they’re constantly looking at what we’re doing and trying to make sure we’re not stepping on their toes, though I think it’s a big enough market for all of us, to be honest.”\n\nREBUILD CRICKET TO MAINSTREAM STATUS? THE SPORT PREDATES THE ASHES IN THE US.\n\nCricket was one of America’s first outdoor team sports, with archived references to it being played in the United States from 1709.\n\nGeorge Washington’s troops are said to have played a version of the game at Valley Forge during the American Revolution in 1778, while Benjamin Franklin owned a copy of the 1744 Laws of Cricket.\n\nAs cricket spread across the globe via the British Empire, embedding itself into the national identity of Australia and India, the sport also became a popular pastime in the US, with nearly 1000 cricket clubs across 22 states during the 19th century.\n\nThe first international cricket match was played between the USA and Canada in Manhattan in 1844, more than three decades before Australia’s first Test match against England, and is reported to have drawn 10,000 fans.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln reportedly attended a match between Chicago and Milwaukee in 1849, while the Philadelphia Cricket Club had first-class status between 1874 and 1913 and rivalled some of the world’s best teams during the late 19th century.\n\nBut perhaps it is best that some history is left unknown, for the club defeated Australia three times through this period.\n\nCricket’s golden age in America came to an abrupt end when the Civil War started in 1861, with baseball becoming entrenched in the national identity.\n\nAmerican cricket went into a seemingly irreversible decline over the coming decades, fading into obscurity following the world wars.\n\nThe sport’s popularity grew marginally after the United States was admitted to the ICC as an associate member in 1965, but cricket remained relatively unknown until the turn of the millennium, with about 30,000 people playing or watching cricket in America.\n\nCourtesy of the mass influx of immigrants from cricket-obsessed South Asian nations such as India and Pakistan, that figure has since ballooned to more than 200,000.\n\nAmerica’s South Asian population has increased exponentially from 3.4 million in 2010 to 5.4 million in 2023, while the Indian diaspora in the United States is among the wealthiest of any migrant community.\n\nMeanwhile, North America is already the third-largest television market for cricket behind India and the United Kingdom.\n\nA WHITE BALL FUTURE FOR THE STARS AND STRIPES\n\nThe 2024 T20 World Cup is cricket’s latest attempt to push into the largely-untapped American market but it is not the sport’s first attempt to win over the US.\n\nA prototype of T20 cricket called One Season was played in America in 2004 before West Indies legends greats Clive Lloyd and Desmond Haynes launched an early edition of Major League Cricket the following year. Both competitions folded and faded into insignificance.\n\nA decade later, cricket icons Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar hosted a series of exhibition matches across the United States, recruiting former teammates for games in diamond-shaped baseball stadiums. It drew the attention of expats from South Asia and the Caribbean, but failed to capture the attention of the wider American public.\n\nThe US didn’t have the multipurpose facilities required to host an international-quality cricket tournament, partly due to well-documented governance issues between USA Cricket and the ICC.\n\nHowever, the sport’s recent privatisation paved the way for the development of purpose-built cricket stadiums across the country.\n\nIn 2019, American Cricket Enterprises received exclusive sanctioning rights to set up a T20 league in the United States, pledging to invest in local cricket pathway tournaments and help fund cricket stadiums nationwide.\n\nThe deal meant more than $US 1 billion would be invested into the development of domestic US cricket and a couple of years later, the organisation announced the inaugural season of its new T20 tournament — Major League Cricket, the most ambitious attempt yet to establish professional cricket in the US and a competition being steered in part by Geale.\n\nBankrolled by four Indian Premier League franchises and leading Indian-American tech executives, including the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan, MLC quickly became one of the wealthiest T20 tournaments in the world, receiving investments that exceeded AU$174 million.\n\nCricket NSW and Cricket Victoria also joined the venture, signing on as operational partners for two of the competition’s six franchises.\n\nMLC’s inaugural season was played across three weeks at Texas’ Grand Prairie Stadium and North Carolina’s Church Street Park in 2023.\n\nEach of the six franchises — based in Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Seattle and New York City — were given a $1.5 million salary cap to secure 18 players, including seven overseas stars.\n\nThe roster included former Australian captain Aaron Finch, World Cup champion Adam Zampa, T20 globetrotter Tim David, West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell, New Zealand quick Trent Boult and South African prodigy Dewald Brevis.\n\nThe 2023 season surpassed financial expectations, with most of the 19 matches selling out.\n\nMLC has already secured the services of Smith, Head and Maxwell for an expanded 2024 campaign, along with Ricky Ponting as a head coach, while plans are in motion to build more stadiums and infrastructure over the coming years.\n\n“When I came to Seattle in 1989, there weren’t any cricket teams,” Soma Somasegar, co-owner of the Seattle Orcas, told The Athletic.\n\n“Today, there are about 250 to 300 cricket teams in Seattle spread across multiple leagues. That grassroots energy and excitement is true, not just in Seattle but in a lot of cities in the country.\n\n“We’re trying to think for the long term. Attracting the stars is part of how we start; using what they do to penetrate school and college environments to help people see cricket is interesting. Our dream is that kids can see that and then grow up here to play at college or professionally.”\n\nHead, for his part, is excited to be heading to the US to represent the Washington Freedom.\n\n“I just wanted an opportunity to see what that circuit looked like. It is going to be nice to be in the States after the World Cup,” he told foxsports.com.au.\n\n“It is important to have a little bit of a spell before we go to England for those one-dayers and I have to try to prioritise a little bit of rest at some point.\n\n“But to get my first look at T20 franchise cricket, I’m early in the scheme of things in terms of the IPL and there is still a lot of touring to go, but I am enjoying it. It is good. It is fun.\n\n“I feel like I am at the right stage of my career to be able to prioritise all three formats, which is nice. It is a nice feeling from my end.”\n\nHIGH HOPES FOR THE MLC POST THE WORLD CUP\n\nThe 2024 MLC season kicks off four days after the T20 World Cup final and is aiming to capitalise off the buzz generated from the marquee tournament.\n\nThe T20 World Cup will have legitimate cricket fields with drop-in pitches and temporary grandstands, including a $30 million venue in New York that will host the blockbuster match between India and Pakistan.\n\nCurrently, ticket prices for the event range from $2,000 to $22,000, but those prices are expected to leap further closer to the game.\n\nThe 34,000-seat modular Nassau County Stadium, located in a repurposed public park about 50 kilometres east of Manhattan, has finished construction just in time for the event.\n\nA drop-in pitch was grown in the temperate subtropics of Florida and transported in sections across a 2000-kilometre journey along America’s east coast.\n\nGeale believes the wicket for the MLC-operated venue in Dallas, which hosted the opening match of the tournament between the USA and Canada, is world class.\n\n“It has taken four years to get this stadium up in Dallas and the head curator, who is from Adelaide, has done an amazing job,” he said.\n\n“It really is a world class wicket and we can’t wait for the world to see that with the World Cup and with the best players,(which) means that we can showcase the game the best it can be.”\n\nThe T20 World Cup will be competing for airtime alongside the NBA Finals and Major League Baseball, but there otherwise aren’t any major sporting events happening in the United States in June.\n\nThe window in July used for the MLC is also favourable in terms of the international calendar, with the only competition The Hundred in England during July.\n\nCricket has thrown everything it has got at the United States.\n\nThe next decade will provide a gauge as to whether the sleeping giant has awoken and has the muscles to become a power.",

Cummins's SRH fell short on the final hurdle, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders in a lop-sided showdown clash last week.\n\nDespite the loss, Cummins' credentials as captain speaks volumes due to his achievements on the International circuit. He has led Australia to the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup victories in 2023. He also led the Aussie team to retain the Ashes in England with a 2-2 draw in a five-match series last year.\n\nThe upcoming MLC will begin on July 5, five days after the T20 World Cup in the Americas.

Cricket has been on the rise in the USA over the past couple of years. The Major League Cricket (MLC) has played a crucial hand in the growth of cricket in the country. Recently MLC became the second Associate Franchise Tournament after the United Arab Emirates' International League T20 to acquire List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\nThe fever of cricket has seen an influx of interest in the USA as the T20 World Cup is just on the verge of commencing. Ahead of the tournament, while talking about the sport's growth in the USA, Kohli stated he never expected to play any cricket format in the USA.\n\n\"Honestly, I never thought that we would be playing cricket in any form in the States. But now it's a reality. That tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world. The United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first one on a global scale to accept it in a way with the World Cup, which is I think it's a great start. It's the ideal way to begin. So I think it's going to have a huge impact,\" Kohli said in a video posted by the U.S. Consulate Mumbai on X.\n\nMLC's debut season in 2023 transformed the landscape of American cricket, bringing world-class domestic T20 action to the United States for the first time with most of the matches played in front of sold-out crowds in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nAfter a successful end of the inaugural season of MLC, the second season will feature top stars from the cricket giants.\n\nKohli talked about the influence of MLC and its potential in developing interest in cricket among the fans and added, \"In starting off a kind of a domino effect and I hope that it carries on for a long period of time. We have enough people as I said from our regions to keep the game up and alive in the States and make the others more aware about what it feels like to play cricket and watch cricket. I think it's got great potential with the MLC as well. There's already franchise cricket happening there. So I think it's moving in the right direction.\"\n\nWashington Freedom will be Australian-stacked in the upcoming season.

    "body": "The league is also planning to expand from the current six teams to 10 in the coming seasons\n\nESPNcricinfo staff\n\n27-May-2024\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC), the season-old T20 tournament in the USA, has become the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire List A status from the ICC, following on from the UAE's ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThe status means that MLC will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics. \"We are really excited for the news as it's a recognition of the standard and high quality of players taking part in the tournament,\" tournament director Justin Geale told ESPNcricinfo. \"By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale.\n\n\"The most important part for me though is it ensures the performances of some of the world's best players alongside their peers are adequately reflected in their career statistics.\n\n\"Really thankful to the ICC for taking the time to look at it as cricket in the USA doesn't always fit into a template. We are an Associate nation and proud of that, one with a unique opportunity in front of us. It's our hope that on the back of the upcoming World Cup and a successful season we can continue to build a platform for the sport to grow and ultimately succeed in the USA.\"\n\nThe 2024 edition of MLC will start on July 5, a week after the T20 World Cup ends on June 29 in Bridgetown. The T20 World Cup begins, however, in Dallas, USA on June 1, in what is an important season in the game's continuing efforts to crack the US market.\n\nThe Guardian, which reported on the awarding of List A status on Monday, also revealed MLC's plans to expand from the current six teams to 10 over the next few years, jumping from 19 games in 2023 to 34 by 2025. Twenty-five games have already been scheduled for this season.\n\n\"It was always intended to be a 10-team league,\" MLC's chief executive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the Guardian. \"Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that's our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.\"\n\nSrinivasan said they wanted the league, which clashes with the Hundred in 2024, to start in early June in 2025.\n\n\"Ultimately for us, our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,\" Srinivasan said. \"With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That's how we would like to establish our window.\"\n\nAn early June start avoids a clash with the Hundred's July-August window, but it could mean an overlap with the T20 Blast. This scheduling clash became a major talking point in the last English summer when Jason Roy opted out of his ECB contract to play in the MLC and went on to represent LA Knight Riders, who have the same owners as that of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), who won their third IPL title on Sunday.\n\nLast year, MLC ended two days before the start of the Hundred, though this time there will be an overlap of six days between the two leagues, with the MLC ending on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. As a result, as many as half of the overseas players in the Hundred could arrive in the UK late after the MLC ends. Twelve out of the 24 overseas players under contract in the men's Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in MLC and more could follow before the tournament starts.\n\nFour of the six teams in the MLC are owned by IPL team owners - Mumbai Indians, KKR, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals.\n\nThe first season ran from July 13 to 31 with 15 group-stage games followed by four playoff matches, and ended with MI New York lifting the trophy under the captaincy of Nicholas Pooran. The second season will be played across the same two grounds which hosted the first season - the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and the Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.",

    "body": "Had the driver been one of the curious American-born spectators who ventured inside the venue and witnessed the USA's first ever T20 World Cup game -- a pulsating seven-wicket victory over Canada -- he would have had the answer.\n\nYes, team game it is, but in the shortest form it is also one that can be largely won by the brilliance of an individual.\n\nFor the USA's maiden victory, in front of a passionate crowd inside the purpose built, 7,000 capacity home of Major League Cricket, that individual was Aaron Jones.\n\nJones' unbeaten 94 of 40 balls, featuring 14 boundaries, ten of them sixes, with the stadium PA blasting out Miley Cyrus's \"Party in the USA\" after the biggest hits, transformed what could have been a very low key American debut in elite cricket into a spectacular celebration.\n\n\"Especially because America is not really a 'cricketing country'. I wanted to win the first game of the tournament for our fans and we did that,\" a smiling Jones said after the game.\n\nNow the USA must prepare for a much bigger test of their credentials in the sport's elite, when they take on Pakistan, at the same venue, on Thursday.\n\nConverting Americans?\n\nBut there is a bigger context to this tournament for the co-hosts because as much as organiser's play down the attempt to convert American sports fans to the pleasures of the old game, part of the whole idea of holding the biennial tournament in the USA is to establish some firmer roots for the sport here.\n\nThere were two things to note about the crowd at Grand Prairie -- as expected the majority of spectators were drawn from the Indian community in Texas but as they showed throughout, they are fervent backers of the national team of their adopted country.\n\nEvery one of New York born but Barbados-raised Jones' sixes was greeted with a massive roar and the final one, to seal victory, set off wild celebrations in the stands.\n\nThe second element was that, scattered among those Indian-heritage fans were local Americans who have, to a greater or lesser degree, been won over by the game.\n\nSean Fortner, who drove three hours from Houston with his family and friends, was attending his first ever match but said he had watched many games on television after studying Indian society and culture at University.\n\n\"I watched it for a long time, trying to figure it all out,\" he told AFP, \"Finally I got one of my Indian friends to explain all the rules to me and I just got hooked on it\".\n\nSo much so that Fortner even made a seven-minute video explainer that he shared with his companions before they made the trip to the game.\n\nAnother Texan first-time fan Ryan Ubl from Dallas, was also at his first game.\n\n\"I got into it really during the ODI World Cup in India. I worked with a bunch of people from India and they were very enthusiastic about it all and so I watched a bit of it and tickets weren't so expensive, so here I am,\" he said.\n\nUbl is a baseball fan and knows there are limits to how far cricket could go in the USA but thinks there is a future beyond this tournament.\n\n\"Obviously I don't think it'll ever eclipse baseball but it could carve out its own little niche,\" he said.\n\nFortner agrees even if he knows the sporting mainstream remains far away.\n\n\"Just watching how hard it has been for soccer to get a (foothold) when half the people that live here love soccer already, it's a hard hill to climb. But it can catch on, we know fandom and we get loyal,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not going to get a lot of fans but we'll get loyal fans,\" he said.\n\nJones, still buzzing from his spectacular innings was understandably in no mood for measured considerations even with Pakistan and top-ranked India to come.\n\nHis accent may be Bajan but the attitude and rhetoric was all-American.\n\n\"We want to play fearless cricket. We want to play hard cricket. We want to play smart cricket and I think we're going to go into the Pakistan game with the same mindset. We want to play fearless cricket regardless of who we play against,\" he said.\n\n© 2024 AFP",
    "summary": "The USA cricket team won their first-ever T20 World Cup game against Canada, thanks to a brilliant unbeaten 94 from Aaron Jones. The match was played in front of a passionate crowd of 7,000 at the purpose-built stadium, which is also the home of Major League Cricket. The win was a significant milestone for cricket in the USA, where the sport is not widely popular. The tournament organizers hope to increase the sport's popularity in the country. The crowd was largely made up of Indian-Americans, but there were also some local Americans who were attending their first cricket match. The USA team will next face Pakistan in a tougher test of their skills. Jones, the star of the match, is confident that his team can play fearless cricket and make a mark in the tournament.",

The Unicorns’ roster features World Cup winners and global talents from international teams including Australia, Pakistan, and New Zealand. Long-time public company Commvault is an associate sponsor of the defending champions of Major League Cricket, MI New York, where Accenture is the principal sponsor. MI (Mumbai Indians) New York is a T20 cricket team established in 2023.

It’s a no-brainer.”\n\nCommvault’s sponsorship will feature opportunities to engage with fans including exclusive watch parties, contests, and cricket clinics with professional players. Fans, partners, and customers will also have the chance to join these events in the Dallas and Morrisville stadiums.\n\nGriffin said: “This partnership not only allows us to engage with cricket fans but also reinforces our dedication to fostering community and resilience. We’re excited to share the Commvault spirit and support the MI New York team on their journey. We’re thrilled to connect with cricket fans and bring the Commvault spirit to the pitch.”\n\nCommvault said cricket is the second most watched sport globally, with more than 2.5 billion fans. As cricket’s popularity surges in the United States, Commvault’s collaboration with MI New York aims to bring the thrill of the game to a broader, more diverse audience. In Commvault’s view, it serves as an opportunity to educate an untapped global fan base about the importance of resilience – critical knowledge that is applicable to both personal and professional life, whether on the pitch or in a Commvault Cleanroom defending against cyberattacks.\n\nMumbai Indians play in the Indian Premier League and is owned by Indiawin Sports Pvt.

    "body": "Cricket in the United StatesCountryUnited StatesGoverning bodyUSA CricketNational team(s)United StatesFirst playedbefore 1700\n\nNational competitions\n\nInternational competitions\n\nCricket in the United States is a sport played at the amateur, club, intercollegiate and international competition levels with little popularity, with 200,000 players (<0.1% of the population) across the country.[1] Major League Cricket is the highest level of domestic T20 cricket currently played in America, with T20 being the format of the game that much of the recent growth in American cricket is occurring in.[2][3]\n\nIn 2006 it was estimated that 30,000 people in the United States play or watch cricket annually.[4] By 2017, this figure had risen to 200,000 people playing cricket in 6,000 teams.[5] Cricket in the United States is not as popular as baseball and is not as popular among as large a fraction of the population as it is within either the Commonwealth nations or the other ICC full member (or Test cricket) nations.[6] There are at least two historical reasons for the relative obscurity of cricket within the United States. One reason was the 19th-century-rise of the summer time bat-and-ball sport now called baseball, which displaced cricket as a popular pastime.[6] Another reason was that in 1909 when the ICC was originally organized as the Imperial Cricket Conference it was open only to Commonwealth nations and thereby excluded the U.S. from participating in the sport at the highest level.[7]\n\nNevertheless, in 1965 the U.S. was admitted to the renamed ICC as an associate member and the sport grew in popularity in the second half of the 20th century. An oft mentioned reason for the growing popularity of cricket is the growing population of immigrants to the U.S. who come from cricket playing nations.[4][6]\n\nWith the launching of the United States Youth Cricket Association in 2010, a more focused effort to bring the game to American schools was begun, with the intention of broadening cricket's fan base beyond expatriates and their children.[8] In addition, USA Cricket has begun offering various championship tournaments for youth cricketers, such as the MLC Jr. Championship.[9]\n\nESPN has been stepping up its coverage of cricket in recent years, buying the cricket website Cricinfo in 2007, and broadcasting the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 competition, the 2014 Indian Premier League, English County Championship games, and international Test cricket.[10]\n\nIn 2021, Minor League Cricket, a professional Twenty20 cricket league sanctioned by USA Cricket, began play. Major League Cricket is planning to launch its first season in 2023.[11][12] In addition, various championships and pathways are being offered for youth cricketers, such as the MLC Jr. Championship.[13]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nCricket was played by British colonists in North America by the start of the 18th century.[14] Archived references to cricket played in America date from 1709. A New York newspaper from 1739 contains an advertisement for cricket players and the first documented competition occurred in 1751 in Manhattan.[15] According to William Byrd II's diary, cricket was played on the slave plantations of Virginia, including on his Westover estate among neighbors and slaves.[16] By 1793, Dartmouth College students were playing cricket on the Green.[17]\n\nPhiladelphia was the crucible of North American cricket and remains so today.[4] Haverford College formed a cricket team in 1833, generally accepted as the first cricket club exclusively for Americans.[18] Haverford and the University of Pennsylvania formed a strong rivalry, with the first match played on May 7, 1864, believed to be start of the third-oldest intercollegiate sporting contest in America, after the 1852 Harvard-Yale crew and 1859 Amherst-Williams baseball matches.[19] Haverford and Penn then proceeded to play each other for three consecutive years until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds.[20] From 1875 and through 1880, Haverford College, Columbia College and University of Pennsylvania fielded a varsity elevens, which played a few matches each year against each other and other club teams.[21]\n\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association,[22] which Cornell University later joined.[23] During the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924) Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the de facto national championship) 23 times (3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford), Haverford won such championship 19 times (3 shared with Penn and Harvard, 1 shared with Penn and Cornell, and 1 shared with Penn), and Harvard won it 6 times, none after 1899 (3 shared with Haverford and Penn).[24][circular reference][25]\n\nIn July 1895 an international cricket match between Canada and the United States was played on the Manheim grounds in Germantown section of Philadelphia with six of the United States team being Penn student athletes and, in September of that year, past and then current members of Penn's varsity cricket team played past and then current members of the English cricket teams of Oxford and Cambridge resulting in Penn defeating the Oxford-Cambridge team by one hundred runs.[23] This was not surprising as in the last two and a half decades of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century, Philadelphia was the center of cricket in the United States[26] Cricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the Merion Cricket Club and the Germantown Cricket Club).\n\nThe eleven-person team cricket familiar with Americans today took root most effectively at the St. George's Cricket Club, founded in 1838.[16] Clubs from the United States (St. George's CC) and Canada participated in one of the first international cricket matches on record in 1844 in Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan.[27][28] Cricket received a significant amount of media coverage at the time. In the mid-19th century, the sport was played in approximately 125 cities in 22 states. Roughly 500 officially established clubs existed and it is probable that in 1860 there were 10,000 boys and men in America who had actively played the sport for at least a season.[15]\n\nSt. George's CC employed Sheffield native Samuel Wright as its professional cricket playing groundsman. Wright's two sons, Harry and George, played for the United States XXII against the All England XI in 1859 in New York and Philadelphia.[29] Both Wright brothers became renowned in baseball circles after they played for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, America's first professional baseball team.[29] English cricket teams toured American regularly. Richard Daft's England side visited in 1869, when they played in New York and Philadelphia. Then with the spread of cricket to Boston, Lord Hawke's England XI played George Wright's New England Cricket XI at the Longwood Country Club in Boston. On the same tour in 1891 Lord Hawke's XI defeated a Germantown CC XI in Philadelphia, which included George Patterson, regarded as America's best batsman, with several centuries to his credit. George Patterson – referred to as America's W.G. Grace – was an American-born cricketer and lawyer by profession, described as brilliant under pressure when facing first-class English sides.[29]\n\nIt may have been during the Civil War that baseball overtook cricket and secured its place as America's game.[30] An army making a brief stop at a location could easily organise a game of baseball on almost any clear patch of ground, while cricket required a carefully prepared pitch. After the Civil War, baseball became a much more organized sport than cricket in America, with more money and competition available to baseball players across the country;[31][32] thus, baseball began to poach players and administrators from the world of cricket. It has been suggested that the fast-paced quick play of baseball was more appealing to Americans than the technical slower game of cricket,[30] which at the time was played over a much longer duration than baseball;[33] some attempts were made to nativize cricket in a way that would reduce its length and other perceived disadvantages relative to baseball, such as the American innovation of wicket, a variation of cricket which could be played in an afternoon.[34][35] However, the natural tendency toward baseball was compounded by terrible American defeats at the hands of a traveling English side in 1859, which may have caused Americans to think that they would never be successful at this English game.[36] By the end of the Civil War, most cricket fans had given up their hopes of broad-based support for the game. Baseball filled the role of the \"people's game\" and cricket became an amateur game for gentlemen.[30][37]\n\nGoverning bodies[edit]\n\nThe United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) previously served as the governing body for cricket in the United States, as an associate member of the ICC from 1965 to 2017. The USACA faced turmoil and governance issues in the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2005 the USACA was suspended from the ICC's annual conference due to issues with the association's election process, but that suspension was lifted in March 2006.[38] In February 2006, a competing commercial body, Major League Cricket (MLC), proposed that it replace the USACA as the United States' representative in the ICC, citing its more substantial efforts in developing the sport in the country (especially at grassroots levels such as schools, which the USACA had ignored), and accused the USACA of having \"the morbid opinion that they do not need any outside assistance whereas the development of the game.\"[39][40]\n\nThe USACA was suspended by the ICC in 2007 for its failure to adopt a constitution and hold elections in a timely manner, and the U.S. team pulled out of the World Cricket League Division Three.[41] The organization was suspended once again in 2015, citing \"significant concerns about the governance, finance, reputation and cricketing activities\" of the organization. However, the U.S. team was still allowed to continue competing in events such as the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, with ICC Americas serving as an interim caretaker of its cricket operations.[42][43] In 2017, the ICC voted to expel the USACA, citing its increasing debt and failure to ratify a certified constitution.[42]\n\nIn January 2019, a new body known as USA Cricket was approved as a new associate member of the ICC, replacing the USACA as the United States' representative.[44][45]\n\nNational teams[edit]\n\nMen's team[edit]\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. men's team was promoted to Division Two of the World Cricket League for the first time.[46] In 2019, the United States qualified for the inaugural season of its replacement, the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, whose top teams will move on to the qualifier for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.[47][48] On November 16, 2021, the ICC announced that the United States and West Indies would co-host the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup.[49] It will be the first ICC World Cup tournament to feature matches played in the United States - with three venues finalized in New York, Florida & Texas.[50]\n\nIn December 2021, the United States hosted Ireland in a T20I and ODI series, which marked the country's first-ever home series against a Test-playing nation.[51][52] The two teams split the T20 series.[53][54] However, the ODI series was cancelled due to COVID-19 issues.[55]\n\nWomen's team[edit]\n\nIn November 2021, the United States won the 2021 Women's T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier, advancing to the global qualifier for the 2023 Women's T20 World Cup.[56]\n\nDomestic competitions[edit]\n\nThere have been various attempts at domestic cricket leagues in the United States: Pro Cricket was formed in 2004 as a commercial cricket league not sanctioned by the ICC, which played a modified T20 format with changes intended to further increase the pace of the game, including five-ball overs.[57] The USACA, later in partnership with New Zealand Cricket, proposed a T20 competition known as the American Premier League, patterned after competitions such as the Indian Premier League. It was announced in 2009, but never came to fruition.[58][59] The American Twenty20 Championship was later held in 2011 as a three-day event in New Jersey between regional teams, to help develop and promote American players.[60]\n\nVia the investment arm American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), USA Cricket has sanctioned the domestic T20 league Minor League Cricket, and plans to launch the professional competition Major League Cricket (no relation to the aforementioned organization) in 2023.[61]\n\nInternational competitions[edit]\n\nOn November 16, 2021, the International Cricket Council announced that the United States along with the West Indies will co-host the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, making the first ICC World Cup Tournament to take place in the United States.[62][63] Team USA upset Team Pakistan in the 2024 Cricket World Cup.[64]\n\nCricket grounds[edit]\n\nThere are only a few purpose-built cricket grounds in the United States, they include the Germantown Cricket Club Ground and the Philadelphia Cricket Club Ground[65] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Randolph St. George Walker Park on Staten Island, New York; the Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill, Florida; and the Leo Magnus Cricket Complex in Van Nuys, California.\n\nThe Indianapolis World Sports Park in Indianapolis, Indiana, which features cricket grounds, was completed in 2014, and hosted the USACA's national championship that year.[66]\n\nThe game is also played on a number of shared purpose venues, they include Van Cortlandt Stadium in Bronx, New York and others.\n\nIn 2021, American Cricket Enterprises leased AirHogs Stadium, the home field of the defunct Texas AirHogs baseball team, to redevelop it as a cricket-specific stadium and USA Cricket training facility.[61] The revamped stadium was completed in 2023 and it was named as Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nThe main cricket grounds in the United States include:\n\nCentral Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill - Hosted 4 T20I since 2010. It is the home ground for the Ft. Lauderdale Lions in Minor League Cricket. It is also scheduled to host a few matches during the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie - The stadium is used for the Major League Cricket matches, it is also home ground for the Texas Super Kings. It is scheduled to host a few matches during the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\n\nLeo Magnus Cricket Complex in Los Angeles - Hosted five List-A match between India-A and Australia-A in 1999.

    "date": "Sat Jun  8 12:42:35 2024",
    "body": "The United States of America (US) and the West Indies, both co-hosts of the ongoing men’s T20 cricket world cup, are on an ascendency in cricket, though in different ways.\n\nWhat if these two regional ascendant forces of cricket came together and played as one?\n\nThe US has been creating space for cricket to grow in its shores for at least a handful of years in a significant way. They have been building stadiums, hosting professional tournaments like Major League Cricket, and developing the supporting infrastructure for cricket to flourish within the country.\n\nAs for letting the bat and ball do the talking, they have been on a roll there, as well. They recently beat Bangladesh 2-1 and before that gave neighbours Canada a 4-0 hammering, both at home.\n\nBy courtesy of these wins, they came in hot into the T20 world cup. Then, they beat rivals Canada in the tournament opener — and they did it in style, posting the third-highest successful run chase in a T20 cricket world cup.\n\nAnd then came the big win — beating the 2022 T20 world cup runner-up, Pakistan.\n\nThey will face a much stiffer opponent in India, and Ireland is decent too, in the days to come. But it’s safe to say that they can’t be ruled out from registering an upset after what they did against Pakistan — especially in the shortest format of the game where, as is said routinely, anyone can beat anyone else on a given day.\n\nHowever, for the US to come out of this group and move to the next stage would only be a bonus, an extraordinary one at that. By simply playing good competitive cricket and hosting the world cup well, the US would have already made a mark in cricket.\n\nDon't forget that they are playing host to a cricket world cup for the first time ever and are staging the biggest game of the tournament in India versus Pakistan — biggest because the US has a large diaspora from both countries.\n\nThese wins, both on and off the field, would probably be sufficient for the US to sustain its ascendency in a game billions of people around the world love, but is yet to hit its strides in a significant way in North America.\n\nUnlike the US, cricket is deeply rooted in the West Indies. They were the cricket powerhouse in the early years and remained competitive most years. Then, they found a format where they could once again claim the big prize and stamp their authority — and they did, becoming the T20 world cup champions twice in the previous decade. (Only England has matched them in this feat.)\n\nIt made sense for them to develop their version of the Indian Premier League (IPL), and thus was born the Caribbean Premier League (CPL). Just like in India, local talent got a domestic platform in which to perform and shine. The Caribbean players benefited especially by playing among some of the best cricket players in the world to ever do it.\n\nHowever, the West Indies hit a rough patch early this decade. The defending champions crashed out of the 2021 T20 world cup by failing to go past the super 12s, the main round preceding the semi-final and final rounds. They won a solitary game out of the five they played in this stage.\n\nIn the subsequent edition in 2022, they failed to make it past even the first round — losing against Scotland and Ireland, and winning one against Zimbabwe — finding themselves unable to move to either of the two main groups that would fight for the prize.\n\nIn a bigger blow, they failed to even qualify for the 2023 one-day international (ODI) world cup in India, after losing to Scotland in the super six stage of the world cup qualifiers in Zimbabwe. It was the first time that they didn’t feature in an ODI world cup since the coveted tournament began in the mid-1970s.\n\nSo, not only were the T20 world cup exits a major setback for a team whose slam-bang style was best-suited for success in the shortest format, they didn’t even get a chance to flex their muscle in ODIs. (They only just made it to the 2019 ODI world cup through the qualifiers, in more evidence, if necessary, of the team’s decline in limited-overs cricket over the years.)\n\nBut since then, the Windies have made a bit of a comeback. In the T20s, they won 3-2 against India and England at home in 2023. This year, they swept the T20 series against South Africa 3-0 playing at home. In the ongoing T20 world cup, they beat Australia in the warm-up game and won their first official game of the tournament, against Oman.\n\nThey’ve got a good taste of success of late and would want to keep the winning momentum going right through this tournament. After all, winning at home is a motivation that little else can match.\n\nTherefore, the US and the Windies have a lot to prove right now, both in their own ways. That being the case, here’s returning to the radical idea proposed earlier — club the US with the Windies for cricketing purposes.\n\nThe precedent for such a grouping lies in the Windies itself. The West Indies aren’t a political unit. They are a grouping of 15 nation-states and territories in the Caribbean region, all administered by one cricketing body — Cricket West Indies (CWI).\n\nMoreover, this composite unit isn’t set in stone. The fluid setup is open to more sign-ups, such as potentially the Bahamas. The US would make for a great cricketing addition to the Windies.\n\nThe US’ strength is their finances and infrastructure, alongside the experience of hosting world-class sporting events. In an interview with ESPNcricinfo, CWI and T20 World Cup chief executive Johnny Grave described the US as “the most developed sports market in the world” and added that “the more we can reach out to it, the more we are likely to attract high-value sponsors and broadcasters.”\n\nTwo of the three venues picked for the US leg of the T20 tournament, Grand Prairie (Dallas Texas) and Broward County (Lauderhill, Florida), already had the infrastructure in place to be a world cup venue. Still, the capacity at both these venues was lifted further by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\nThe third venue, at Nassau County in New York, came into being from scratch only this year. Modular stadium technology was used for the purpose, adopted previously at ICC events to increase venue capacity. There are several other cricketing venues in the US waiting to be developed further in order to accommodate more games and people in the stands.\n\nIn any case, the North American market is ripe for cricket to be embraced in a more significant way, potentially benefiting both the region and the game. And in the shorter term, the ICC is eyeing the addition of cricket in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.\n\n“We strategically decided to bid for the men's T20 World Cup… jointly with the US because we wanted to grow the sport in our time zone, which we believe is crucial to our long-term survival,” Grave told ESPNcricinfo.\n\nWhile the US can lead the physical infrastructure side of things, the Windies can show the way with its talent. Some of the best ever cricket players have come from the West Indies over the years — Joel Garner, Clive Lloyd, Malcolm Marshall, Vivian Richards, Michael Holding, Brian Lara, Curtly Ambrose, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, to name only a few.\n\nThis is not to say that the US takes a backseat with its players. They have extraordinary talent to offer themselves — consider captain Monank Patel and some of the heroes of the Canada and Pakistan contests, Andries Gous, Aaron Jones, and Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nFurther, left-arm seamer Tara Norris, who played for Delhi Capitals in the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in 2023, made history by bagging the tournament’s first five-wicket haul and took player-of-the-match honours. She went on to pick up seven wickets in five games. (Shockingly, she went unsold in WPL 2024.)\n\nStill, there are places up for grabs in the US' cricket team, as is evident from the ambitious recruitment drive pursued by USA Cricket for years.\n\nThe effort has led to the inclusion of foreign players like New Zealand’s Corey Anderson, England’s Liam Plunkett, Pakistan-origin Ali Khan, and India’s Harmeet Singh. US team’s deputy, Jones, is also originally from Barbados.\n\nUSA cricket’s idea has been to win games before thinking about achieving an all-US composition.\n\nA potential US-Windies grouping could comfortably put together tens of elite cricket players, who could fill up additional teams in the way that India has its A, B, and C teams alongside the main national team. The supplementary teams could act as a feeder to continuously keep putting the very best talent out there on the world cricket stage.\n\nIt’s easy to imagine how competitive such a team would be, making global cricket more competitive than it is now.\n\nThat’s that about the venues and players. What about the US viewers? Will they watch games of cricket?\n\nInitially, of course, the viewership will have to be driven primarily by the country’s 50 lakh-odd-strong South Asian diaspora. The hope will be that they will turn up to the ground in sizable numbers and enjoy watching cricket, before the fever gradually catches on to the rest of the population.\n\nPerhaps, cricket might never become as popular as baseball or basketball in the US, but it doesn’t need to. The US is a large enough country to accommodate the sporting interests and needs of a 33-odd-crore-strong population.\n\nThere’s enough cricket interest to go around already. “I don't think people know actually how much cricket there is in this country,” Gous told the Washington Freedom franchise last year, as per ESPNcricinfo. “It's ridiculous. Everywhere in the country there's cricket. If you want to play 12 months a year, you'll find it.”\n\nA joint statement hailing CWI and USA Cricket’s successful joint bid to host the 2024 men’s T20 world cup spoke of “aims to unlock the potential of the USA and fast track the growth of the sport; to inspire the next generation of young West Indians and ignite the cricketing passion in the Caribbean; and to combine these two forces for the benefit of world cricket.”\n\nWhile they may not have thought of uniting as one cricketing unit when they said “combine these two forces,” it might be an idea to consider “for the benefit of world cricket.”",
    "summary": "* The US and West Indies, co-hosts of the men's T20 cricket world cup, are on the rise in cricket, with the US creating space for cricket to grow in the country by building stadiums, hosting professional tournaments like Major League Cricket, and developing infrastructure for cricket to flourish.\n* The US has been performing well in the T20 world cup, beating Bangladesh 2-1, Canada 4-0, and recently, Pakistan, and is looking to make a mark in the tournament.\n* The West Indies, a cricket powerhouse, has been struggling in recent years but has made a comeback, winning T20 series against India and England at home and sweeping South Africa 3-0.\n* The article proposes a radical idea of combining the US and West Indies cricket teams, citing the precedent of the West Indies themselves being a grouping of 15 nation-states and territories in the Caribbean region, and the potential benefits of merging the two teams, including attracting high-value sponsors and broadcasters.\n* The article highlights the strengths of each team, with the US bringing financial and infrastructure resources and the West Indies bringing cricketing talent.\n* It also mentions the possibility of the US hosting cricket in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games and the development of cricket venues in the US.\n* The article concludes by imagining the competitiveness of a joint US-Windies team and the potential for global cricket to become more competitive.",

This move underscores the growing appeal of cricket in America, where major commercial opportunities are luring high-profile players.\n\nCummins’ decision was influenced by the potential long-term prospects beyond cricket and the chance to network in Silicon Valley, a global hub of technology. This strategic signing enhances Major League Cricket’s (MLC) reputation as a premier T20 destination, indicating a power shift from traditional leagues like the Big Bash League in Australia.\n\nThe inclusion of Australian stars such as Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell further boosts the competition, which is in its infancy with just one season completed. Cummins, who last played in the Big Bash in 2018 due to national commitments, has maintained his connection with the league through ambassadorial roles. Despite his success in the IPL, where he earned over $3 million as captain of the Sunrisers this season, Cummins is seeking new challenges and opportunities in the flourishing American cricket scene.\n\nCummins expressed his optimism for cricket’s future in the US, noting the rapid development of Major League Cricket and the vast market potential. The global connections and extended possibilities offered by the team owners and Silicon Valley’s thriving ecosystem are significant attractions beyond the game itself.\n\nThe MLC, scheduled from July 6 to 29 this year following the World Cup, could pose availability challenges for Cummins next year due to a two-Test series in the West Indies during June and July. Joining Cummins at the San Francisco Unicorns this season is batting sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk, further strengthening the team’s lineup. The Washington Freedom has also secured renowned Australians like Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, and Steve Smith for the upcoming season.\n\nIn a significant boost for the league, MLC has gained List A status for its second season, elevating its standing as an official T20 competition with records now contributing to official T20 statistics.

    "date": "Thu May 30 09:51:04 2024",
    "body": "Reports are indicating that a new women’s T20 franchise tournament might soon take place in the United States. Although the idea is still in its nascent stages, key figures in American cricket are eager to leverage a unique opportunity.\n\nThis opportunity arises from the upcoming 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the recent success of the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) men’s T20 tournament.\n\nWith cricket poised to debut in the 2028 Olympics and the USA women’s national team likely qualifying as hosts, there is a growing recognition of the need to foster the women’s game domestically. The recent success of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in India, where international stars have earned substantial salaries, underscores the commercial viability of women’s T20 cricket.\n\nThough the proposed tournament is still in the discussion phase, it would aim to attract top global players and potentially run alongside the existing men’s franchises in the MLC. Owners of several MLC franchises, including the Ambani family who own MI New York, have shown interest in developing women’s teams. This initiative could significantly enhance the profile and earnings of women’s cricketers worldwide.\n\nShould these plans come to fruition, they could impact the international schedules of England’s women cricketers and their participation in domestic tournaments such as The Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has already increased domestic women’s players’ earnings, but these still lag behind the lucrative offers seen in the WPL.\n\nStarting a Women’s T20 Cricket League in the USA: A Major Boost for the Sport\n\nEstablishing a women’s T20 franchise league in the USA would be a landmark event for cricket, providing a stage for the best talent globally to display their skills and potentially inspiring a new generation of American women cricketers.\n\nOver recent years, USA Cricket has made significant strides in the sport. Notably, the upcoming ICC men’s T20 World Cup in 2024 will be the first ICC event hosted in America.\n\nThe development of a women’s T20 franchise league in the USA is seen as a timely and strategic move to enhance the sport’s domestic presence. It represents not only a significant boost for women’s cricket but also an important step in the broader growth and popularity of cricket in the United States.\n\nThe initiative aligns with the global trend of increasing investment in women’s sports, highlighting the growing recognition of women’s cricket as a commercially viable and exciting proposition.",
    "summary": "* There are plans to launch a new women's T20 franchise tournament in the United States, which would aim to attract top global players and potentially run alongside the existing men's franchises in the MLC.\n* The idea is still in its early stages, but key figures in American cricket are eager to leverage the opportunity presented by the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the success of the inaugural MLC men's T20 tournament.\n* Owners of several MLC franchises, including the Ambani family who own MI New York, have shown interest in developing women's teams.\n* The initiative could significantly enhance the profile and earnings of women's cricketers worldwide and potentially impact the international schedules of England's women cricketers.\n\nNote: There is no specific information about the 2023 MLC tournament schedule, teams, or players in this article. The focus is on the potential launch of a women's T20 franchise tournament in the USA.",

    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the United States.\n\nThe Guardian said the US league now has six franchises but plans to launch two more in the near future, and two more soon after that.\n\nThe announcement comes just after MLC has been fully legitimised by the news that its matches have been awarded List A status by the International Cricket Council.\n\nThe significant development marks yet another crucial milestone in the growth and status of Cognizant Major League Cricket, and cricket more broadly in the United States.\n\nIt recognizes Cognizant Major League Cricket as an official T20 league and America’s first world-class domestic tournament.\n\nNow, every century, half-century, ‘five-for’, run-out, win, loss, and championship will be documented as official career statistics in an internationally recognized format of the game.\n\nThis will also provide local US players and upcoming stars of the game the opportunity for international recognition, furthering the development of domestic talent by the MLC.\n\nThe List-A Status comes after the MLC’s successful inaugural season and underscores its unwavering dedication to delivering premier cricket in the United States.\n\nIn addition to the official List-A status, MLC CEO, Vijay Srinivasan, recently announced aspirations to expand from what began as a 19-game season in 2023 to a 34-game season by 2025.\n\nHe said, “It was always intended to be a 10‑team league. Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nThe Guardian further stated that the move will have significant implications for the landscape of the professional sport in England.\n\nThe second season, which starts at the end of the men’s T20 World Cup, runs for 23 days and overlaps with The Hundred.\n\nThe US tournament next year will be significantly longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC is keen to play in June.\n\nHe said, “Ultimately for us our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer. With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nThat would clash with the T20 Blast season in England but leave The Hundred to run from late July through August.\n\nMLC’s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed that it was the “direction of travel” for the game on 10 May, but there is frustration about slow progress.\n\nMLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local players. It is now working on developing more List A venues. “We’re not here to play a league and go away every year,” Srinivasan said.\n\n“We feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think 10 years from now, I think you’ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we’ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.”\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.

    "body": "Read Also: England Clinches Series Victory\n\nEarly Investors and Launch of Major League Cricket (MLC)\n\nThe US Cricket Board has talked about starting a franchise-based cricket league in 2018. Overcoming the initial hurdles, $120 million i.e. about Rs one thousand crore was raised for the league in May 2022.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, Shah Rukh Khan co-owned IPL franchise KKR, technology entrepreneur Anand Rajaraman, and former Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan were among the early investors. The first season of the MLC was played in July 2023 with 6 teams. All the teams consisted of Indian investors. Actor Shah Rukh Khan is a co-owner of IPL franchise KKR, IndiaWin Sports, the company that runs Mumbai Indians (MI), GMR Sports, the owner of Delhi Capitals, and Chennai Super Kings bought teams with different partners.\n\nStructure and Results of MLC’s First Season:\n\nThe first season of the MLC had 15 group-stage matches played between July 14 and July 26. The four playoff matches took place on July 27, 28 and 30. All 19 games were played at the Dallas and Morrisville stadiums. The group stage saw 6 teams playing 5-5 matches, i.e. one team played a 1-1 match with the other 5 teams.\n\nLike the IPL, the first season of the MLC had the top-4 teams qualifying for the playoffs. MI New York played the final match after winning the Eliminator and Qualifier-2. The team defeated Seattle Orcas by 7 wickets in the final and won the title of the first season.\n\nNicholas Pooran scored a century, he was also the highest run-scorer in the tournament. MI’s Trent Boult took the highest number of 22 wickets. American Cameron Gannon was the Man of the Tournament by taking 11 wickets for Seattle Orcas.\n\nUpcoming Second Season of MLC\n\nThe final match of the T20 World Cup will be held on June 29. Six days after this, the second season of MLC will start in America on July 6. This time also matches will be played in only 2 stadiums, but 21 matches will be played in the group stadium instead of 15. A team will play 7 matches instead of 5. Season 2 of MLC will start immediately after the World Cup, which will connect the global cricket audience with the American audience. The matches of the second season will start at 12:30 pm and 6 am Indian time. According to America, this time it will be night, so more fans will reach the stadium and watch the match.\n\nChallenges for MLC in Competing with IPL:\n\nThe brand value of IPL is Rs 89 thousand crore, while the brand value of MLC is Rs 1 thousand crore. Rs 1,000 crore is spent on the salaries of players in IPL, while only Rs 57 crore is spent on the salaries of players in MLC.\n\nWhile cricket is not among the top 10 most watched sports in America, no other sport is watched more than cricket in India. Major League Cricket (MLC) is currently in its initial stages, where 6 foreign players can play in the playing-11. In comparison, only 4 foreign players play in IPL. The biggest reason for the success of IPL in India is Indian players. Therefore, if MLC has to compete with IPL, it will first have to improve the quality of players in its country. Which now seems to take a lot of time.\n\nThe International Cricket Council approved List-A for Major League Cricket on May 28. This means that now the statistics of players and teams in this tournament will also be counted in T20 records. The second season of MLC will begin on July 6, just 6 days after the T20 World Cup.\n\nIn the second season, there will be an increase from 19 to 25 matches. It is planned to increase to 34 matches by 2025, increasing the number of teams from 6 to 8. The MLC chief executive said the MLC plans to eventually make it a 10-team tournament. Barring the IPL, no country has ever had 10 teams in any franchise tournament. It will be important to see how the T20 World Cup will affect Major League Cricket.",
    "summary": "**Launch and Investors**: The MLC was launched in 2022 with an investment of $120 million from investors including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Shah Rukh Khan, and others.\n\n**First Season**: The first season of MLC was played in July 2023 with 6 teams, all owned by Indian investors. The season consisted of 15 group-stage matches and 4 playoff matches, with MI New York winning the title. Nicholas Pooran was the highest run-scorer, and Trent Boult took the highest number of wickets.\n\n**Upcoming Second Season**: The second season of MLC will start on July 6, with 21 group-stage matches and 7 matches per team. The matches will be played in two stadiums, and the timing will be adjusted to attract more fans.\n\n**Challenges**: MLC faces challenges in competing with the Indian Premier League (IPL), with a significant difference in brand value and player salaries. To succeed, MLC needs to improve the quality of American players.\n\n**International Recognition**: The International Cricket Council approved List-A status for MLC, allowing player and team statistics to be counted in T20 records.\n\n**Future Plans**: The MLC plans to increase the number of matches to 34 by 2025 and eventually become a 10-team tournament, a first for any franchise tournament outside of the IPL.",

    "body": "Apparently, the United States national cricket team’s victory against Pakistan in the 2024 T20 World Cup earlier this month has created higher enthusiasm for the sport domestically. That’s the gamble Monumental Sports Network is taking, at any rate. The regional sports network (RSN) which serves fans in Washington, D.C., the DMV and parts of Pennsylvania has announced a new partnership with Willow by Cricbuzz to distribute a package of Major League Cricket matches featuring the Washington Freedom, beginning with a match on Saturday, July 6.\n\nMonumental Sports is available on DIRECTV STREAM, Hulu Live TV, and YouTube TV.\n\nKey Details:\n\nMonumental Sports Network’s coverage of Washington Freedom cricket will continue through July.\n\nViewers can watch Monumental as part of a pay-TV subscription, or in-market with the Monumental Sports Network App.\n\nMajor League Cricket matches are normally broadcast on Willow TV in the United States.\n\nMonumental is partnering with Willow to offer seven Washington Freedom cricket matches, beginning on July 6 and continuing through July 22. The matches will join WNBA basketball contests from the Washington Mystics, though they won’t be available on Monumental long enough to air alongside NBA games from the Washington Wizards or NHL matchups featuring the Washington Capitals on the channel.\n\nCheck out Monumental’s schedule of Washington Freedom matches:\n\nDate Time (ET) Opponent Saturday, July 6 3 p.m. MI New York Monday, July 8 3 p.m. Texas Super Kings Thursday, July 11 8:30 p.m. Seattle Orcas Sunday, July 14 3:30 p.m. LA Knight Riders Tuesday, July 16 8:30 p.m. MI New York Friday, July 19 8:30 p.m. Texas Super Kings Monday, July 22 8:30 p.m. San Francisco Unicorns\n\nThe presentations are being made in partnership with Willow, which carries all MLC matches on the Willow TV channel and Willow on-demand streaming platform. Chief operating officer of Willow Todd Myers specifically cited the U.S. national team’s victory at the T20 World Cup as an inciting factor for the partnership with Monumental.\n\n“The unexpected success of the US national cricket team in the T20 World Cup has vividly shown us the untapped potential of cricket in America,” Myers said. “We are now at a pivotal turning point where we can leverage the country’s excitement and passion for the sport to build a broader, more engaged fan base nationwide.

But with the cost of marquee sports rights climbing inexorably, providers are looking for any way to bring new content to their airwaves without paying extreme amounts to get it.\n\nThat could lead more RSNs to add small cricket packages of their own in the near future. Major League Cricket only has six teams at the moment, but some are stationed in cities like Los Angeles and New York where viewers have access to SportsNet-branded RSNs. I don’t think any cricket teams playing in areas where a Bally Sports channel is the dominant RSN will see a new deal with Willow to distribute games in the near future; Diamond Sports Group, which owns the Bally Sports channels, has enough problems with the partner leagues it currently has at the moment.",

    "body": "Pat Cummins became Cricket Australia’s first $3 million player last year, and earned another $3.67 million at this year’s IPL, but money had nothing to do with him joining the San Francisco Unicorns in America’s fledgling Major League Cricket competition.\n\nAustralia’s Test and one-day captain was planning some time at home but has instead jumped at the opportunity to build relationships with some of America’s most successful entrepreneurs in nearby Silicon Valley.\n\nThe most an MCL player can earn is about $300,000 for seven regular games and, potentially, two finals. Cummins earned more than $216,000 a match in the IPL.\n\nThe lead investors in the San Francisco team, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, friends from Chennai who completed computer science PhDs at Stanford University and have become successful entrepreneurs, initiated the chase for Cummins.\n\n“Of course we’re huge fans of Pat Cummins and really wanted him to join the team,” Rajaraman told this masthead. “But what really helps us out is how sort of tech-savvy and forward-thinking Pat Cummins is.\n\n“He was thinking of his career beyond cricket, and he’s thinking about how to do interesting things at the intersection of technology and cricket, even after his playing days are done.\n\n“He felt it would be valuable for him to develop deep relationships with Silicon Valley. We are, fortunately, in Silicon Valley, and we can help connect that.\n\n“All the top companies and the top venture capitals are here, and we can help him network and build the kind of knowledge that he wants about start-ups and venture capital and so on. That’s why it kind of worked out.”\n\nCummins’ manager, Neil Maxwell, said the player was excited about the opportunities.\n\n“He’s a very curious bloke, and he likes to learn,” Maxwell said. “He finds that learning about these things is really interesting.\n\n“There’s a range of people connected to this franchise, including the CEO of YouTube, CEO of Adobe. It just opens up Silicon Valley.”\n\nCummins, who is in the West Indies preparing for Australia’s Twenty20 World Cup match against Bangladesh on Friday morning (AEST), may be the world’s only premier fast bowler with a degree in business management.\n\nIt was a strange signing because the Unicorns are supported by Cricket Victoria, while his home state of NSW supports the Washington Freedom. The four other teams in the MLC are run by IPL franchises.\n\nLoading\n\nRajaraman and Harinarayan approached Cricket Victoria chief Nick Cummins about signing the elite paceman.\n\nNick Cummins once worked with Pat Cummins as general manager of the Sydney Thunder, and knew it would take more than another T20 competition to clinch the deal.\n\n“Pat was pretty clear: ‘I’m not looking for more opportunities to play cricket,’” Nick Cummins told this masthead.\n\n“My conversation with him and Neil was more around, ‘This is so much more than cricket, thinking about your aspirations and what you want to do beyond cricket.’\n\n“It’s a chance to connect with the tech community in Silicon Valley, connect with the greenest state in America around what he’s doing for Cricket for Climate [an environmental organisation], and I think that’s what really excited him about it.”\n\nSports news, results and expert commentary.

    "body": "Alright, enough with the mean jokes, it’s no fault of the good people of Long Island. While the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup leaves American shores over the weekend and heads out for the West Indies, the hard yards of ‘taking cricket to America’ story continue. Five days after the World Cup final, Season 2 of Major League Cricket begins, featuring six franchise teams over two venues — Grand Prairie in Texas and Morrisville in North Carolina.\n\nSeason one of MLC was deemed a success, Forbes reporting revenues at $8m with 17,000 spectators across the 18-day, 19-match league last year. Sanjay Govil, owner of MLC franchise Washington Freedom who moved to the US in the 1980s, said for decades “we never thought cricket was going to come to us”. But it’s here and he has a hand in it, as the only solo owner of an MLC franchise. Freedom gets its name, he says, from striving, throwing away shackles, taking a different path. Of the other five franchises, three are owned and run by IPL big dads: Texas Super Kings, LA Knight Riders and defending champions MI New York. The other two, Seattle Orcas and San Francisco Unicorns, have many millionaire co-owners.\n\nGovil is pleased that Freedom, who partnered with Cricket NSW for game management, made the playoffs and finished third in Season 1. Season 2 should have them better prepared, with a new CEO, Cricket NSW still involved and a roster that reads Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, Steve Smith, Marco Jansen, and T20 World Cup Team USA superhero, Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nWhat MLC is doing, Govil says, is unlike mainstream cricket. “We’re not just building a league but we’re also building the sport in the US. That’s a very different paradigm as compared to other countries. A harder thing to do.” Within the first decade of the MLC, he says, the dream is that cricket becomes a “semi mainstream” game — “like lacrosse or rugby” and MLC occupies a spot just behind the top US leagues: gridiron football, basketball, baseball and ice hockey.\n\nThis will mean “not just promoting major cricket, but also minor cricket, academies, cricket in schools, having an expanded grassroot kind of thing. That is going to be very, very paramount in how we approach cricket in the US.” Increasing playing numbers from more than 100,000 weekend players, from a predominantly South Asian diaspora audience, is also part of the mission. The size of the cricket-viewing audience in the US ranges between three million to a wild consultancy figure of 25 to 30m. Govil overall is realistic. “To get to where we want — is a 20, 30, 40-year journey.”\n\nIn MLC1, 12 of 19 matches were held in the Grand Prairie (GP) cricket stadium in suburban Dallas. The ground was repurposed from an abandoned baseball venue called AirHogs Stadium for the Texas AirHogs, which folded in 2020. This exercise led to MLC being called the “hermit crabs of sports leagues by D Magazine sports editor Mike Piellucci. Like the hermit crab, MLC found an empty shell of the AirHogs stadium, climbed into it, and from there have turned Grand Prairie into “Cricket City, USA”.\n\nIn the World Cup, Grand Prairie provided the best playing surface and spectator experience. Once again, it will host 16 of the 25 MLC2 matches, with Morrisville’s Church Street Park staging the other nine. Piellucci, Dallas-born and bred, reminds me that cricket has made its entry into Dallas at a time when the city/region is enjoying its golden era across the big leagues.\n\nThe Texas Rangers have won the Major League Baseball world series, the Dallas Mavericks are in the NBA finals, its NHL team Dallas Stars have made two conference finals in a row. “And the football team (Dallas Cowboys) is the most valuable sports franchise in the world.”\n\nHe says not only will cricket have to “break through” the buzz created by the other leagues, “there’s no lull period because you are going from success to success.” Time for the Texas Super Kings to pull out their cricket league A-game, no doubt.\n\nMLC has been positioned for July, which is known though as a ‘dry season’ for US sport in between the leagues. With summer temperatures in Dallas rising, Piellucci suggests getting a roof over the cricket ground would be a good idea. “The owners will have to convince people to go out and engage in a sport that they might not know about and do it when the weather is really, really hot...it’s a tough sell to kind of work with.”\n\nIn trying to explain Dallas’ response to its sports teams, Piellucci told contrasting stories between football/soccer and ice hockey. Dallas was an original market for Major League Soccer (Dallas Burn/FC Dallas) “but they’ve never had this huge groundswell of support…” this despite the fact that people love the sport and that Dallas is a big hub for youth soccer and its talent development pathway.\n\n“There's a ton of talent that comes out of here… but the (MLS) team itself doesn't have the support because I guess they’re not successful… they’ve not been a consistent winner…” While the Dallas Stars ice-hockey team is much loved — even in this non-traditional ice hockey market — because, Piellucci says, “they never really tank…what they do is they’re consistently very good.” Plus, the last two seasons have had them produce “truly excellent” results.\n\nCricket must grab eyeballs in a multi-sports-league-saturated market. Dallas-Fort Worth teams also play in leagues across rugby, ultimate frisbee, and the spring football minor league called United Football League. In May 2024, Dallas Trinity FC women’s professional soccer team joined the USL Super League.\n\nThe MLC, however, cannot be the only event to build cricket's popularity in the country because, Piellucci says, the other leagues “are constantly on people’s minds.” He says, “It can’t just be major league cricket, there have to be more competitions, other competitions… going a few different times a year… you have to get a foothold on the calendar and claw to stay in people’s minds, to remind them.”\n\nCricket's growth story in the most lucrative market outside South Asia has to somehow stay relevant even after MLC2 ends in mid-July. Piellucci says it’s not just about gaining a foothold now, but also “don’t get people to forget about you the other 46 weeks of the year?” It’s no surprise that he and his magazine called MLC, and through it cricket in the US, as the “greatest experiment in pro sport”.",
    "summary": "**Season 2 of MLC**: The second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) will begin five days after the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup, featuring six franchise teams across two venues: Grand Prairie in Texas and Morrisville in North Carolina.\n\n**Success of Season 1**: The inaugural season of MLC was deemed a success, with revenues of $8m and 17,000 spectators across 18 days and 19 matches.\n\n**Team Ownerships**: Sanjay Govil, owner of Washington Freedom, is the only solo owner of an MLC franchise, while three other franchises (Texas Super Kings, LA Knight Riders, and MI New York) are owned by IPL bigwigs.

    "body": "The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by the US and Caribbean countries, quickly delivered a thrilling surprise. Team USA — largely comprised of non-resident Indians, some sharing alma maters with their Indian counterparts — stunned Pakistan with an unexpected early victory in the tournament.\n\nCricket, overshadowed by America's beloved baseball, is experiencing a remarkable revival. Last year's launch of Major League Cricket has ignited a wave of enthusiasm, drawing significant investments from notable South Asian-Americans like Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai.\n\nWhat's behind this cricket craze in America? While the sport is still warming up to locals, its resurgence is fuelled by the fervent support of the South Asian diaspora. Looking ahead, cricket's integration into the 2028 LA Olympics as a primary sport — the first such occurrence in over a century — signals a bright future.\n\nThis scenario presents a win-win: South Asians in the US can indulge in their beloved sport, while the International Cricket Council (ICC) taps into a lucrative new market, expanding cricket’s global footprint.\n\nOn to best of Mint’s journalism this week:\n\n🇮🇳 Finally, after seven weeks of marathon elections, the new government was sworn in on Sunday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi opted for continuity over sweeping changes as he began his third term. Modi reaffirmed his confidence in key ministers like Amit Shah and Nirmala Sitharaman, retaining them from his previous Union cabinet. Key allies, including the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal (United), also secured Cabinet posts, indicating a coalition setup. Mint’s Rituraj Baruah, Manas Pimpalkhare, and Subhash Narayan report on the swearing in and appointments, which took place amid a sizable gathering of around 9,000 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, with political figures and celebrities in attendance. The new Union cabinet consists of 30 ministers, featuring a notable presence of veterans from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and leaders from allied parties who have demonstrated strong electoral performances in their regions. This composition is seen as an effort to stabilize the government's position, given the BJP's reduced majority.\n\n🎥 India's independent films, celebrated at international festivals, struggle to secure a spot in domestic theatres, overshadowed by blockbuster hits. Titles like the recent Cannes winner All We Imagine As Light and other festival favourites such as All That Breathes, Agra, and Kennedy find themselves eclipsed by mainstream blockbusters. The business model of cinema in India has shifted, favouring multiplexes with high ticket prices, making it harder for indie films, which often lack big stars and mass appeal. Unlike in the past, when ticket costs were low and films reached a bigger audience, today's indie films face prohibitive marketing costs that many cannot afford. This need for significant marketing investment, often in the millions, puts these films at a disadvantage, confining them to less than 100 screens in major cities, compared to thousands for mainstream films. Mint’s media and entertainment correspondent Lata Jha reports on the challenges indie flicks face in their bid to reach mainstream audiences.\n\n💼 Maniraj Pattamsetti, a mechanical engineering graduate from Bengaluru, hoped that Simplilearn Solutions’ job guarantee programme would be his gateway to a new career in data science. Despite investing over ₹2 lakh in a six-month course, Pattamsetti found himself working a customer support role in a BPO, earning far less than promised and without any job offers in his field of study. Simplilearn had assured Pattamsetti and others a job with a minimum salary of ₹5 lakh per year upon completion of the programme—and a full refund if they failed to secure employment. However, two years on, only 271 out of 900 enrollees have landed jobs through the programme. Many, like Pattamsetti, feel cheated, having invested significant amounts in an education that didn’t pay off as expected. Mint’s startup correspondent Samiksha Goel reports on the situation, which has led to numerous complaints, with some students considering legal action against Simplilearn, a company valued at $600 million and backed by private equity giant Blackstone. Simplilearn has since discontinued the programme, leaving many students grappling with debt and disappointment. This scenario underscores the challenges within the edtech sector, where aggressive sales tactics and overpromising can sometimes lead to significant consumer dissatisfaction.\n\n📊 N. Chandrababu Naidu was sworn in as the 18th chief minister of Andhra Pradesh on 12 June. Naidu’s term begins under challenging conditions, as he inherits a financially strained state that has been largely overlooked industrially. His Telugu Desam Party (TDP), along with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners, secured a sweeping victory, capturing 164 out of 175 seats in the state assembly. During his campaign, Naidu promised to enhance governance and kickstart economic development, aiming to revive industrial activity and generate 2 million jobs. However, the financial reality of Andhra Pradesh could complicate these plans. The state is grappling with a high debt level—44% of its GDP—and its finances are stretched thin, primarily going towards revenue expenditures rather than building productive assets. This fiscal strain makes the ambitious welfare promises and the revival of the Amaravati capital project, initially estimated to cost ₹50,000 crore, particularly challenging. Mint’s senior editor N. Madhavan explains the hurdles Naidu faces as he takes over from Jagan Mohan Reddy as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.\n\n✅ During the recent Lok Sabha election, many urban voters seemed reluctant to visit their polling booths. The Election Commission highlighted this trend, noting a particularly low turnout in urban areas. Ultimately, only about 65.8% of eligible voters cast their ballots, down from 67.2% in 2019. Regions like Nagaland and Manipur saw significant decreases in turnout, while Jammu and Kashmir experienced an increase. Why does this matter? Niti Kiran from Mint’s data team explains through charts and maps. Lower turnouts can sometimes indicate voter satisfaction with the current government, which appeared to be the case in this election. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) held more seats in areas with lower voter turnout. However, it's not just about the numbers—it's about who shows up, or rather, who doesn’t. Metros saw a sharper decline in turnout compared to rural regions. Despite this, the overall gender gap in voting was virtually non-existent, similar to the previous election. Women turned out in higher numbers than men in nearly 20 states. The reasons behind voter participation or apathy can vary widely from state to state, influencing everything from local policy to national politics.\n\n🫀 India is on the verge of significant changes to its organ transplant policies, aiming to address the massive shortfall between the supply and demand of organs. The Union government is considering allowing organ exchanges between unrelated individuals to bridge the gap when blood groups within families do not match, potentially shortening the long wait times endured by patients. Currently, India faces a significant disparity between the demand for transplants and the number performed each year. While the country needs approximately 200,000 kidney transplants annually, only 6,000 are carried out. The situation is even more dire for heart transplants, with just 10 to 15 procedures conducted yearly One significant move under consideration is the introduction of \"swap\" donations, where families could exchange organs with one another if they are compatible, a practice currently not allowed for non-relatives. Additionally, the government is in talks with the insurance regulator to extend health insurance coverage to organ donors, who are presently excluded from most health insurance plans. Mint’s Priyanka Sharma reports on these pivotal policy changes.\n\n🦹‍♂️ The 2024 Lok Sabha election brought a significant political shift, yet the prevalence of criminal charges among newly-elected Members of Parliament (MPs) remains a concerning issue. With 46% of the MPs having declared criminal cases against them, this marks a slight increase from the previous assembly. The data suggests a persistent and troubling connection between politics and crime in India's legislature. More alarming is the nature of these cases. A significant portion of the MPs face 'serious' criminal charges involving severe crimes such as murder and rape. This situation casts a shadow over the credibility of the lawmakers and raises ethical questions about the integrity of those elected to represent the public. Mint’s Manjul Paul illustrates, with charts and maps, the extent to which individuals with criminal cases have been elected as public representatives in the 18th Lok Sabha.\n\n📉 For India's IT sector, FY24 has been a year to forget, and FY25 doesn't look much brighter. Discretionary IT spending, crucial for the sector's growth, remains subdued amid weak global macro-economic situation. This gloom is reflected in the muted performance across key business verticals like banking, financial services, insurance (BFSI), high-tech, and retail. Even robust deal wins in the March quarter haven't translated into expected revenue growth, adding to the uncertainty, Mint’s Harsha Jethmalani reports. Cost-efficiency measures and sluggish client decision-making, making the revenue recovery timeline unpredictable, has exacerbated the situation. Notably, projections for technology spending in 2024 by major US banks suggest a slowdown compared to the previous year. This has led to a cautious outlook for FY25, with leading IT companies like Infosys and HCL Technologies setting modest growth targets that have failed to boost investor confidence. Amid these challenges, there's a silver lining. Possible interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve could revive the BFSI sector, potentially increasing IT spending.\n\n🔋 On 9 February 2023, the Geological Survey of India announced a groundbreaking discovery of 5.9 million tonnes of lithium reserves in Jammu and Kashmir, catapulting India into the top 10 nations with lithium resources and sparking immediate interest from major companies like JSW Group and Hindalco Industries. This announcement shifted the dynamics of India's mineral exploration focus, as lithium is essential for batteries used in various technologies, including electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy storage. However, the excitement was tempered by the auction for these reserves, which saw only two bidders and had to be cancelled due to insufficient interest. This highlighted the speculative nature of the unproven reserves, still classified under G3, indicating a low level of confidence and substantial further exploration needed. Exploration of the lithium reserves in Kashmir—the least mined region of India—remains a tricky situation many companies are reluctant to engage in. The reserves were found merely 50 km from the Line of Control (LoC), a highly volatile geopolitical location. Mint’s Sumant Banerji examines the reasons behind the lack of interest in India’s white gold reserves.\n\n👩‍🎓 🧑‍⚕️ The recently concluded National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), crucial for admissions for medical course,has faced serious scrutiny. An unusual outcome where 67 candidates, including six from one centre, topped the rankings triggered allegations of leaked papers, and in turn protests. This scrutiny led to the National Testing Agency (NTA) scrapping grace marks for 1,536 students due to procedural issues and announcing a re-test option. Coaching institutes across the country, have now made their apprehensions clear about the irregularities in the NEET exam. Mint’s Krishna Yadav and Devina Sengupta report.\n\nSoumya Rajan, chief executive of Waterfield Advisors, has strategically diversified her investment portfolio, which includes equity, debt, real estate investment trusts (REITs), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), and funds of funds that invest in venture capital and private equity.Mint Money’s Neil Borate writesabout how over the past year, Rajan has shifted her focus from small-cap to large-cap stocks due to concerns about overvaluation in smaller company stocks. She has also increased her investments in REITs and InvITs, seeking stable yields from these assets. Her portfolio adjustments reflect a cautious approach to market volatility and an emphasis on capital preservation. Rajan's firm, Waterfield Advisors, manages about ₹45,000 crore in assets and is exploring fresh equity funding from global family offices.\n\nThat's all for this week, I hope you have a pleasant weekend!\n\nIf you have feedback, want to talk about food, or have anything else to say about our journalism, write to me atsiddharth.sharma1@htdigital.in or reply to this mail.

Viswanathan,[18] publicly announced their team name – the Texas Super Kings, logo and coach for the first time.[19] However, it was announced in late April that they had revamped their logo for it to look similar to the logos of the Chennai and Joburg Super Kings.[20]\n\n2023 season[edit]\n\nPrior to the launch of the official season, it was announced the MLC's inaugural domestic draft would take place on March 19, 2023.[21] The Super Kings had the final pick of the first round draft and selected Rusty Theron,[22] before adding Sami Aslam, Calvin Savage, and Milind Kumar with later selections.[23] In June 2023, the Super Kings announced seven of their nine overseas signings, including Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, and Dwayne Bravo. In addition, they announced their full support staff lineup, including Albie Morkel and Eric Simons, among others.[24] They subsequently announced that former South African skipper, Faf du Plessis, would captain the side[11] and on July 5, selected Mohammad Mohsin as their Domestic Wildcard Pick.[25]\n\nRayudu withdrew from the tournament following the Board of Control of Cricket in India's proposal of a year-long \"cooling-off period\" for recently retired players[26] and his place taken by Imran Tahir.[27]\n\nIn the opening match of the tournament on July 13, the Super Kings recorded a 69-run win over the Los Angeles Knight Riders.[28][29] This was followed by a 6-run defeat to the Washington Freedom in their second match,[30][31] a 17-run victory over MI New York[32] and an 8-wicket defeat to the Seattle Orcas.[33][34]\n\nA three-wicket win over the San Francisco Unicorns ensured a top-two finish going into the playoffs,[35] but losses to both Seattle and New York saw the team eliminated.[36][37]\n\n2024 season[edit]\n\nAhead of the start of the 2024 season on July 5,[38][39] on February 15, 2024, the Super Kings released a list of retentions for overseas players, including captain Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner.[40][41] During the domestic players' draft, the Texas Super Kings selected Joshua Tromp and Raj Nannan.[42][43] Outside of the draft, the team announced a series of overseas signings from New Zealander Daryl Mitchell to Australian Marcus Stoinis.[44][45] Mitchell however, following an injury, was ruled out of the season and was replaced by Afghan cricketer Noor Ahmad.[46]\n\nCurrent squad[edit]\n\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\n\nTexas Super Kings roster Position Name Nationality Date of birth (age) Batting style Bowling style Year signed Notes Batters Faf du Plessis South Africa (1984-07-13) July 13, 1984 (age 39) Right-handed Right-arm leg-break 2023 Direct signing, captain Milind Kumar United States (1991-02-15) February 15, 1991 (age 33) Right-handed Right-arm off-break 2023 Saiteja Mukkamalla United States (2004-04-09) April 9, 2004 (age 20) Right-handed Right-arm off-break 2023 U23 player All-rounders Calvin Savage United States (1993-01-04) January 4, 1993 (age 31) Right-handed Right-arm fast 2023 Zia Shahzad Pakistan (1996-06-18) June 18, 1996 (age 28) Right-handed Right-arm legbreak 2023 Dwayne Bravo West Indies (1983-10-07) October 7, 1983 (age 40) Right-handed Right-arm medium fast 2023 Direct signing Mitchell Santner New Zealand (1992-02-05) February 5, 1992 (age 32) Left-handed Slow left-arm orthodox 2023 Direct signing Marcus Stoinis Australia (1989-08-16) August 16, 1989 (age 34) Right-handed Right-arm medium fast 2024 Direct signing Aiden Markram South Africa (1994-10-04) October 4, 1994 (age 29) Right-handed Right arm off-break 2024 Direct signing Aaron Hardie Australia (1999-01-07) January 7, 1999 (age 25) Right-handed Right arm medium-fast 2024 Direct signing Cameron Stevenson United States (1992-10-30) October 30, 1992 (age 31) Right-handed Right arm fast-medium 2023 Raj Nannan West Indies (1994-09-14) September 14, 1994 (age 29) Left-handed Slow Left arm Orthodox 2024 Daryl Mitchell New Zealand (1991-05-20) May 20, 1991 (age 33) Right-handed Right-arm medium 2024 Ruled out due to injury Wicket-keepers Devon Conway New Zealand (1991-07-08) July 8, 1991 (age 32) Left-handed Right-arm medium 2023 Direct signing Joshua Tromp United States (2005-04-01) April 1, 2005 (age 19) Right-handed Right arm medium 2024 Drafted Bowlers Mohammad Mohsin Pakistan (1996-04-15) April 15, 1996 (age 28) Left-handed Left-arm leg break googly 2023 Domestic Wildcard Pick Zia-ul-Haq Pakistan (1994-12-11) December 11, 1994 (age 29) Right-handed Left-arm fast-medium 2023 Naveen-ul-Haq Afghanistan (1999-09-23) September 23, 1999 (age 24) Right-handed Right-arm medium-fast 2024\n\nDirect Signing\n\nNoor Ahmad Afghanistan (2005-01-03) January 3, 2005 (age 19) Right-handed Left-arm unorthodox 2024\n\nDirect Signing\n\nAdministration and support staff[edit]\n\nTexas Super Kings staff[47] Position Name Head coach Stephen Fleming Assistant coach Eric Simons Assistant coach Albie Morkel Team manager Russell Radhakrishnan Strength and conditioning Greg King High performance analyst Lakshmi Narayanan Physiotherapist Tommy Simsek\n\nPerformance[edit]\n\nStandings[edit]\n\nYear League standing Final standing 2023 Second Semifinals\n\nC: champions\n\nRU: runner-up\n\nSF team qualified for the semi-final stage of the competition\n\nSeason summary[edit]\n\nYear Played Wins Losses Tied/NR[a] 2023 7 3 4 0 Source: ESPNCricinfo[48]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nChennai Super Kings\n\nJoburg Super Kings\n\nReferences[edit]",

He was also a key member of the Dallas Xforia Giants during the 2023 edition of Minor League Cricket.\n\nPick #2 – Seattle Orcas – Aaron Jones\n\nJones returns to a familiar dressing room, having played for the Orcas in last year’s inaugural Major League Cricket season. The top-order batsman has been a cornerstone of Team USA’s success during the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. Jones has made headlines throughout Team USA’s historic World Cup campaign and was part of the USA’s momentous defeat over Pakistan in Texas. Orcas fans will be hoping for similar performances throughout MLC.\n\nPick #3 – MI New York – Sunny Patel\n\nA right-handed middle order batsman and leg spin bowler, Sunny Patel left his mark on the 2023 Minor League Cricket season. His contributions with both bat and ball played a crucial role in the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers advancing to the Championship match, where they lost to the Dallas Mustangs. Patel also provides some variety to the domestic player brigade of MI New York, being the only domestic leg-spinner on their roster heading into the 2024 season.\n\nCognizant Major League Cricket Tournament Director, Justin Geale, said: “Cognizant Major League Cricket plays a critical role in developing domestic players and providing a pathway to play cricket at the highest level amongst some of the best players in the world.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Chaitanya, Aaron, and Sunny to the 2024 MLC season, adding three more talented domestic players to our league.”\n\nThe second season of MLC commences July 5, with reigning champions MI New York taking on Seattle Orcas at Morrisville, NC, followed by Texas Super Kings vs LA Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium, TX.",

    "body": "How the American Cricket Market Can Leverage Opportunities to Draw High-Profile Players\n\nPat Cummins, Australia’s Test and one-day captain, recently made headlines by joining the San Francisco Unicorns in the emerging Major League Cricket (MLC) competition. Despite earning $3.67 million in the IPL, Cummins’ decision to play in the MLC, where players can earn up to $300,000 for a season, was driven by more than financial gain.\n\nCummins saw an opportunity to build relationships with some of America’s most successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. The San Francisco team’s lead investors, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, both Stanford-educated entrepreneurs, played a pivotal role in securing Cummins’ involvement.\n\nThis strategic move highlights the unique selling points that the American cricket market can leverage to attract high-profile players and enhance the commercial appeal of cricket in the U.S.\n\nTech-Savvy Collaborations and Networking Opportunities\n\nOne of the primary attractions for Cummins was the potential to develop deep relationships within Silicon Valley. This region is home to top companies and venture capital firms, offering players like Cummins unparalleled networking and learning opportunities.\n\nCummins’ manager, Neil Maxwell, emphasized this aspect: “He’s a very curious bloke and finds learning about these things really interesting. There’s a range of people connected to this franchise, including CEOs of major companies. It just opens up Silicon Valley.”\n\nThis unique angle can be a major draw for other international players who are looking beyond their cricket careers and want to explore opportunities in technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nEnvironmental Initiatives and Social Impact\n\nAdditionally, Cummins’ involvement with the Unicorns aligns with his environmental advocacy. The opportunity to connect with the tech community in Silicon Valley and engage with California’s green initiatives resonated with his aspirations beyond cricket.\n\nNick Cummins, CEO of Cricket Victoria, who facilitated the signing, noted, “This is so much more than cricket. It’s a chance to connect with the tech community, and align with his work for Cricket for Climate.”\n\nBy emphasizing the broader impact and opportunities for social engagement, the MLC can attract players who are passionate about making a difference off the field as well.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Market Positioning\n\nThe American cricket market can strategically position itself by forming partnerships with tech hubs and promoting the holistic benefits of playing in the MLC. Highlighting the potential for players to network, learn, and engage with leading tech entrepreneurs can significantly enhance the league’s appeal.\n\nMoreover, leveraging the influence of successful entrepreneurs and integrating environmental and social initiatives can create a compelling narrative that attracts both players and fans. This approach not only boosts the commercial lure of cricket in America but also positions the MLC as a forward-thinking and innovative league.\n\nPat Cummins’ decision to join the San Francisco Unicorns underscores the potential for the American cricket market to attract high-profile players through strategic, tech-savvy collaborations and social impact opportunities. By leveraging these unique selling points, the MLC can enhance its commercial appeal and build a robust and dynamic cricket market in the U.S.\n\nThis strategic focus on technology and social impact aligns with Ministry of Sport’s commitment to providing authoritative and engaging insights into the business of sports, inspiring our community to innovate and thrive in the sporting industry.",

Spending more time with my family and enjoying experiences with them at home or abroad is something that’s even more important to me.”\n\nThis announcement follows a less-than-stellar T20 World Cup 2024 campaign for New Zealand, where they failed to reach the semifinals for the first time since 2014. Williamson remained unclear about his future in T20Is, stating, “On, I don’t know. We’ll see where things land,” when asked about his involvement in the 2026 edition.\n\nBy choosing a casual contract, Williamson will receive a retainer while in the camp with the Black Caps, along with the usual match fees. He is expected to be available for most Tests, potentially missing only the September match against Afghanistan in India (which lacks World Test Championship significance).\n\nThe Black Caps’ forthcoming schedule includes tours of Sri Lanka (Tests and ODIs) and India, followed by a home series against England starting in November.

    "body": "The upcoming Major League Cricket (MLC) season faced an early setback as New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell was sidelined due to injury. Mitchell, a key overseas signing for the Texas Super Kings, has been struggling with form and fitness in recent times. His stint at the T20 World Cup 2024 was lackluster, managing only 36 runs across three innings as New Zealand exited the tournament in the group stage. The 33-year-old's troubles extended back to earlier injuries, including a foot injury that forced him to miss the second Test against South Africa in February. His return to cricket thereafter saw him struggle to regain his peak performance, evident in his underwhelming performances for the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL. In light of Mitchell's unavailability, the Texas Super Kings swiftly made a move by signing Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad as his replacement. Ahmad, known for his spin prowess, joins the franchise with expectations to bolster their squad ahead of the MLC season.\n\nMitchell's absence poses challenges for Texas, who had pinned hopes on his all-round abilities. Despite his recent setbacks, Mitchell's experience and potential were seen as valuable assets for the team. However, his recurring injuries and subpar performances necessitated a strategic change, prompting the franchise to opt for Ahmad as a replacement. As the MLC season approaches, the Texas Super Kings will rely on Ahmad to fill the void left by Mitchell, hoping the Afghan spinner can make a significant impact and contribute positively to their campaign.\n\nFollowing Daryl Mitchell's need for rehabilitation, the Texas Super Kings have turned to 19-year-old Noor Ahmad as his replacement. The left-arm wrist spinner boasts international experience, having featured in 10 T20 Internationals for Afghanistan where he has claimed seven wickets with an economy rate of 7.00. Noor Ahmad has also made his mark in various T20 leagues including SA20, ILT20, and IPL, accumulating 97 wickets from 96 matches with impressive figures of 5/11. Currently, he is part of Afghanistan's squad at a major tournament, showcasing his burgeoning talent and potential.\n\nMitchell's absence presents a significant challenge for the Texas Super Kings, who had planned around his contributions alongside key players like former South African captain Faf du Plessis, and New Zealand duo Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner for the upcoming MLC season. Despite this setback, the franchise has found solace in the acquisition of Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis. Recently crowned the top-ranked T20I all-rounder, Stoinis adds substantial firepower to Texas' already formidable batting lineup.\n\nWith Noor Ahmad stepping into Mitchell's role, Texas anticipates his youthful energy and spin expertise will complement their squad dynamics effectively. The team's strategy now pivots towards integrating Ahmad seamlessly into their plans, leveraging his talent to maintain competitiveness throughout the MLC season.\n\nTexas Super Kings Squad",

The 26-year-old will be featured in the MLC throughout July. Leicester have made a solid move by picking Neesham as they have an important final six T20 North Group matches.\n\nNeesham became a household name after his performance for New Zealand in the memorable 2019 World Cup performance, with the Kiwis losing to England in the Final on boundary counts. Leicester are in search of their fourth title after a hiatus of 13 years. They currently sit third on the points table. Talking about Neesham, the all-rounder performed well in the T20 World Cup 2024 as other batters struggled with their form.\n\nAlso Read: 'Virat Kohli will score 100' - Monty Panesar predicts ahead of India-South Africa final at Barbados\n\n“Jimmy brings immense international pedigree and adds perfect balance to our side at a crucial point of our campaign,” said director of cricket Claude Henderson as quoted by BBC Sport.\n\n\"The team is going really well, so I’m excited to help the guys push for a quarter-final spot. The fans are really passionate. It’s a lively atmosphere I’ve experienced first-hand. I’m looking forward to having them on my side this time,” said Neesham on his appointment.\n\nNeesham holds a lot of experience playing for English cricket\n\nThe T20 blast appointment is not new to Neesham as the right-handed pacer has already featured in English T20 cricket before. He has played for Derbyshire in 2016, Kent in 2017, Essex in 2021 and Northants in 2022. He has appeared twice in the Hundred league, having played for Welsh Fire in 2022 and then Oval Invincibles in 2023. His match-winning 57 not out in 33 balls at Lord's adds to his prowess with the bat.",

Among the domestic players selected was Aaron Jones, the vice-captain of Team USA.\n\nAaron Jones (PTI Photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: The Domestic Supplementary Draft for Major League Cricket ( MLC ) took place on June 18, finalizing the rosters for the upcoming second season, set to commence on July 5. Among the domestic players selected was Aaron Jones , the vice-captain of Team USA.\n\nWith the immense popularity of the T20 World Cup and the success of the American team, three MLC teams--Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, and Seattle Orcas--had an available roster spot, allowing undrafted domestic players the chance to secure a place in the forthcoming tournament.\n\nThe supplementary draft order was randomly determined on June 18, and the teams were allotted a 48-hour window to strategize and conclude any internal discussions before proceeding with their picks.\n\nThe domestic supplementary draft selections were as follows:\n\nLA Knight Riders - Chaitanya Bishnoi\n\nA top-order batsman and spin bowler, the 29-year-old played for the Chennai Super Kings championship side in 2018 before moving to the United States to pursue his cricket in early 2023. He was a part of the San Francisco Unicorns squad in the 2023 inaugural season of Major League Cricket, featuring in all five matches for the Bay Area side.\n\nHe was also a key member of the Dallas Xforia Giants during the 2023 edition of Minor League Cricket.\n\nSeattle Orcas - Aaron Jones\n\nJones finds himself back in a recognizable locker room, as he was part of the Orcas squad during the first season of Major League Cricket last year. The opening batsman has been instrumental in Team USA's impressive run in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Throughout Team USA's unprecedented World Cup journey, Jones has been making waves and was a key player in the USA's remarkable victory against Pakistan in Texas. The Orcas faithful will be eagerly anticipating more of the same from Jones during the MLC season.\n\nMI New York - Sunny Patel\n\nSunny Patel, a versatile cricketer who bats right-handed in the middle order and bowls leg spin, made a significant impact during the 2023 Minor League Cricket season. His all-round skills were instrumental in propelling the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers to the Championship match, although they ultimately suffered a defeat against the Dallas Mustangs. As MI New York prepares for the 2024 season, Patel brings a unique dimension to their domestic player contingent. He stands out as the sole domestic leg-spinner on their roster, offering a valuable asset to the team's bowling arsenal.\n\n\"Major League Cricket plays a critical role in developing domestic players and providing a pathway to play cricket at the highest level amongst some of the best players in the world. We are thrilled to welcome Chaitanya, Aaron, and Sunny to the 2024 MLC season, adding three more talented domestic players to our league,\" said Major League Cricket Tournament Director, Justin Geale as per a MLC release.\n\nThe highly anticipated second season of MLC is set to kick off on July 5, featuring a thrilling opening match between the defending champions MI New York and the Seattle Orcas at Morrisville, NC. Following this clash, the Texas Super Kings will face off against the LA Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium, TX.\n\nGiven the overwhelming success and packed stadiums of the inaugural season, cricket enthusiasts are advised to secure their tickets well in advance to avoid disappointment. Fans can choose from various ticket options, with general admission tickets starting at an affordable price of $30 per person, ensuring accessibility for all.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "date": "Fri Jul 21 14:49:15 2023",
    "body": "Cheers and balls smacking against cricket bats will echo out of Church Street Park until Tuesday for the first-ever Major League Cricket tournament.\n\nMorrisville, a cricket hub, was selected as one of the two towns alongside Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, to host the inaugural season’s matches.\n\nThe excitement can be felt in the home of every cricket fan in the town, especially those who made it happen.\n\nThinking about Morrisville becoming an international hub for the sport gives Jana Chellaperumal “goosebumps.”\n\n“This is a dream come true,” he said. “This is a cricket tournament on a different level that the country has never seen yet.”\n\nChellaperumal is a former president of the Triangle Cricket League, which has about 60 teams and over 3,000 players in the area. The seed to get Major League Cricket and to put Morrisville on the map for the sport was planted about 10 years ago.\n\nThe town first hosted Minor League Cricket games in 2021, giving fans a taste of what would come.\n\n“Hundreds of volunteers worked on the ground,” Chellaperumal said. “So, here we are enjoying the fruit.”\n\nThe economic impact the Major League Cricket games will have on the town is yet to be determined, said Rose Cornelius, president of the town’s Chamber of Commerce. Still, over 3,000 people from around the country are expected to be in Church Street Park, at 5800 Cricket Pitch Way, for the games between six founding national teams.\n\nAfter the games were announced in early June, tickets sold fast, with five of the seven games sold out as of Friday morning.\n\nChurch Street Park was expanded for the games, getting more cricket pitch lanes, LED-lit practice pitches and nets, athlete seating, and safety nets. Food trucks will line the park, and CBS Sports and ESPN+ will stream the games in Morrisville and Texas, broadcasting them to thousands of fans.\n\nAn investment in Morrisville\n\n“We’ve gone from being a park to now a world-class cricket facility in eight years, which is amazing,” Town Councilman Steve Rao said.\n\nUSA Cricket started eyeing Morrisville years ago to make more investments in areas with a large fan base, Rao said. Nearly half (46%) of the residents in Morrisville are of Southeast Asian descent.\n\nBecause of its large fan base, the bat-and-ball game of cricket — involving two teams, a total of 22 players, and a 22-yard field with wickets at each end — has grown in popularity over the years.\n\nSimilar to baseball, one team will bat while the other is on the field during the game. The teams switch during the long inning. The batting team will try to score the runs while the bowling team will try to stop them by fielding the ball.\n\nTeams can score up to 200 points in the match, where the game’s object is to score more runs than your opponent in a certain amount of time. To score a run, players need to hit the ball with the cricket bat.\n\nMost young cricketers have only seen their favorite players on TV or social media, but the games in Morrisville have brought the stars to the town.\n\nTop players include Afghanistan T20 captain Rashid Khan, South African internationals Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and David Miller, West Indians Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, and Dwayne Bravo, and others from England, Australia, Zimbabwe, India and New Zealand.\n\nRussell, a Jamaican cricketer for the Los Angeles Knight Riders, said in an Instagram post he didn’t know “such lovely ground was in North Carolina.”\n\nThe cricket field in Morrisville is one of three International Cricket Council-accredited fields in the country, making it eligible for the T20 Cricket World Cup, a goal for Morrisville leaders.\n\n“We’re hoping that the ICC will choose us,” Mayor TJ Cawley said. “That would have 500 million people watching. We’re hoping that this league will continue to expand and in a couple years, it would be wonderful to have one of our own Major League teams.”\n\nThe town is home to the Minor League Cricket team, the Morrisville Raptors.\n\nHow to see Major League Cricket in Morrisville\n\nTickets for the matches on Monday and Tuesday are still available starting at $12, according to the Major League Cricket website.\n\nFriday night, the Seattle Orcas face off against the Texas Super Kings at 5:30 p.m.",

    "date": "Thu Jun 27 16:38:35 2024",
    "body": "The Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) board has announced the introduction of a new rule in the upcoming Lanka Premier League (LPL 2024), which brings in additional powerplay overs for the batting side.\n\nThe LPL 2024 season will span from July 1 to 21, clashing heavily with the Major League Cricket in the United States. The latter will feature more well-known international players; the LPL has generally failed to draw global talent despite the money on offer, but it is popular among local fans.\n\nThe tournament’s fifth season, the LPL 2024 will feature 20 league matches between five franchises, followed by three playoffs and a final. Each team will play each other twice during the league stage before four of the five teams advance to the playoffs.\n\nDambulla Sixers, a new club, is one of the teams. The Dambulla team’s ownership shift was announced earlier this month, after Sri Lanka Cricket was forced to cancel the previous franchise due to one of its co-owners, Tamim Rahman, being arrested by Sri Lanka authorities under the Prevention of Offences Related to Sports Act.\n\nWhat is the ‘Power Blast Overs’ rule in LPL 2024?\n\nThe Lanka Premier League organizers will introduce a new feature dubbed ‘Power Blast Overs’ to add more aggression and excitement to a specific portion of their league. The feature is intended to include a special powerplay in the latter part of both innings.\n\n“The Lanka Premier League 2024 will introduce an exciting new feature with the addition of a special power play towards the latter part of each innings. This innovation, named ‘Power Blast Overs,’ will provide each team with a two-overpower play during the 16th and 17th overs of their innings,” SLC said in a statement.\n\nThe newly introduced Power Blast Overs feature will be used in the 16th and 17th overs of each innings. During this phase, a team will be allowed to field only four fielders outside the 30-yard circle, rather than the typical five outside the first six overs.\n\n“This new power play will be in addition to the traditional power play that occurs during the first six overs of an inning. During the ‘Power Blast Overs,’ only four fielders will be allowed outside the circle, thus creating a more aggressive and thrilling phase of the game,” the statement added.\n\nOn the new feature, Tournament Director of the LPL 2024 Samantha Dodanwela said, “We decided to bring this innovation in order to create further excitement for the league, which is growing year by year. This new introduction is sure to generate a lot of excitement among the fans, and the teams will need to strategize effectively to make the most of this period.”",
    "summary": "* The Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States will take place from July 1 to 21, coinciding with the Lanka Premier League (LPL) 2024 season.\n* The MLC will feature more well-known international players compared to the LPL.\n\nNote that there is no additional information about the MLC tournament in the article beyond these two points, as the primary focus is on the Lanka Premier League (LPL) 2024.",

    "date": "Sat Jun  1 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Is cricket really coming to the United States?\n\nThe game has long desired to conquer the land of dreams, and it won’t get a better shot at finally making it big.\n\nAs the United States hosts 16 matches of the latest ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, there are high hopes that cricket can finally make significant inroads in a lucrative and populous market.\n\nThe stars have seemingly aligned: Following the T20 World Cup, the second edition of the privately run Major League Cricket franchise tournament will bring some of the game’s biggest stars to the US and, in 2028, cricket will feature at the LA Olympics for the first time since 1900.\n\nHowever, cricket in the US has a history of poor governance, riven by factions and financial mismanagement. The sport’s growth has been hampered by the country’s sheer size and diversity of cricket cultures – factors also considered potential strengths.\n\nHere’s the lowdown on cricket’s history in the US and a peek into its future:\n\nIs there an existing cricket culture in the USA?\n\nWhen USA and Canada meet in the opening match on June 1, there will be plentiful reminders that these two countries played the first international cricket match in 1844, when Canada won the two-day fixture.\n\nBut the game took a backseat until the latter half of the 20th century when increased immigration – particularly from the Indian subcontinent – saw the game grow – with little cohesion – in communities from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh as well as the Caribbean.\n\nDoes USA have a cricket board?\n\nA national governing board, the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA), was formed in 1965 but it struggled to unify the diverse and siloed cricket communities for the next three decades.\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC), at times, implemented sanctions – withdrawing USA from tournaments, withholding funds and suspensions – all of which failed to overcome the fundamental issues.\n\nIn 2017, the USACA was expelled from the ICC.\n\nSo who’s in charge now?\n\nA new governing body, USA Cricket (USAC), was formed in 2019 and the USA was officially back in the ICC’s fold as an associate member. There was a new board and a new constitution, but the underlying problems of geography, culture and power struggles remained.\n\nThe following year, after extensive research on potential expansion markets, the ICC identified the USA as the game’s most desirable target. This was largely down to its size, economy, broadcast market and the existing cricket infrastructure and culture.\n\nWho is running the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup?\n\nThe decision to host T20 World Cup fixtures in the US was merely the first step in a long-term strategy.\n\nThe inclusion of the US in the West Indies’ successful bid to host this year’s tournament presented a golden opportunity to expand the sport’s profile but USA Cricket was in no position to facilitate a major event.\n\nIn October 2022, the ICC installed its own local organising committee – T20 USA Inc – to oversee the event.\n\nWhat’s wrong with USA Cricket?\n\nIn the five years since its inception, USA Cricket has had minimal and – at times – no full-time staff. It has instead relied on a mix of temporary contractors, consultants and volunteers.\n\nIt has been issued multiple sanctions by the ICC and – in 2022 – its funding was temporarily suspended.\n\nIt is currently operating without a CEO.\n\nThe selection process for the T20 World Cup squad was mired in controversy and excluded numerous eligible players.\n\nThe head coach, former Australian international Stuart Law, wasn’t appointed until mid-April.\n\nHow good is USA’s T20 World Cup squad?\n\nOn the field, the team has had an encouraging build-up, trouncing Canada 4-0 and defeating Bangladesh 2-1 in bilateral T20 series.\n\nThose results are astonishing considering USA had not played a T20 International since the World Cup qualifiers in July 2022. Since USA Cricket was admitted, the national men’s side has played just seven T20Is outside qualifying events. Since the start of 2022, they have played a total of twelve T20Is. By comparison, Nepal has played 36 in the same period.\n\nHave things improved since the US was announced as the co-host?\n\nThe publicly available minutes of USAC board meetings show that off-field conflicts continue to boil over.\n\nIn the lead-up to the biggest cricket tournament ever held on US soil, there have been squabbles over the constitution, allegations of racial discrimination and disagreements on the process of choosing a new CEO.\n\nA lawsuit filed by two directors against five fellow directors and a former CEO was dropped in 2022, but in 2023 another lawsuit was filed against USAC by former USA captain and league director Sushil Nadkarni.\n\nAt the most recent board meeting on March 27, Chair Venu Pisike “reaffirmed that board members MUST conduct themselves professionally and stop interrupting the board proceedings and being disrespectful to fellow board members”.\n\nHow might cricket grow after the T20 World Cup?\n\nAmid concerns about USAC’s governance, the ICC is forging ahead with plans to create a lasting legacy from the T20 World Cup. Profits from the matches held in Nassau County (New York), Broward County (Florida) and Grand Prairie (Texas) will be funnelled into cricket’s growth in the US.\n\nICC’s game development programme, Playground to Podium, aims to reach one million children – half of them female – by the 2028 LA Olympics, and regional development manager for the Americas, Fara Gorsi, is confident of success.\n\n“By the time we reach the LA Games it will be flourishing in all three cities as a minimum,” Gorsi told Al Jazeera. “And [it] will create a framework that will then be deployed across the states.\n\n“If we want to see a different community grow cricket in the USA it has to come organically through schools, through new leaders, new communities, parents, teachers.”\n\nGorsi says the complexity of the US sporting system requires a targeted and flexible approach in each district as the ICC rolls out resources, initially in the three host cities, to develop facilitators and coaches via an entry-level training programme called Criiio. There are long-term plans to permeate the college system, a key for any sport in the US.\n\nIs there a way to improve the situation?\n\nThe ICC has expressed concerns to USAC and has given them a July deadline to appoint a CEO. They can apply sanctions of varying severity but pressure will also be applied by the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC).\n\nTo become certified as cricket’s national governing body, USAC will have to meet USOPC’s rigorous criteria and standards.\n\nAs for the legacy programme, the ICC has not yet discussed a timeframe or mechanism for any possible future handover of the development programme and its funding to USA Cricket. Gorsi hopes it will eventually happen but admits there are significant barriers to overcome.\n\n“Without wanting to sound disrespectful, they’ve held it on to like it’s their sport,” said Gorsi.\n\n“If we grow it organically we’ll grow faster. We need to take the shackles off and allow it to be fun and have that accessibility across the country.\n\n“Once we break some of those barriers down and allow the US audience to be part of this wonderful game that we all love, I think it will spread like wildfire.”",

    "title": "An influx of domestic T20 Leagues in USA",
    "date": "Sat Jun  1 19:55:00 2024",
    "body": "In the United States of America, a country where people think of cricket as a version of baseball, it is important to understand if the ICC T20 World Cup would be successful or not.\n\nHowever, over the past decade, domestic T20 leagues have taken the cricketing world by storm, transforming the sport from a backyard hobby to a global phenomenon.\n\nAs such in the US, the shortened and quick version of cricket has been gaining popularity little by little.\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC), the US equivalent of the Indian Premier League (IPL), will launch after the World Cup.\n\nUSA Cricket, the ICC's representative organisation for the US, had chosen MLC as its exclusive partner in 2019 to create a professional T20 Cricket League.\n\nIn an effort to propel the USA men's and women's teams to the pinnacle of international competition, the MLC currently also offers assistance to both groups.\n\nThe MLC has been instrumental in providing the much-needed impetus to take cricketing in this region of the world to new heights. The top tier of domestic T20 cricket in the USA was introduced in 2019 with the MLC.\n\nThis has given American cricket players, who are primarily immigrants, a professional platform and high-calibre competition to draw spectators. In 2023, the MLC burst onto the scene, reshaping the American cricket landscape. For the first time, the United States witnessed world-class domestic T20 cricket, captivating audiences with electrifying matches.\n\nBut how would the success of MLC be attributed to?\n\nFirstly, the league would unite some of the top cricket players in the world, giving them a platform where they would display their abilities and dazzle spectators with amazing shows. In addition to drawing in an entirely novel generation of cricket fans, this celebrity influence would improve the game's general standard.\n\nSecondly, it is impossible to overstate the commercial attractiveness of the MLC. The league would serve as a fertile field for rich sponsorship agreements, television rights, and product sales. The MLC attracted numerous sponsors and franchises from other T20 leagues around the world in its inaugural season which was held in 2023. After making an impact in the inaugural season in July 2023, the MLC has got tech giant Cognizant as their title sponsor for the 2024 edition.\n\nIn 2023, each team's total salary cap was $1.15M for the tournament, putting MLC amongst the elite T20 global leagues in terms of player compensation per match.\n\nBesides, Minor League Cricket is the only nationwide tournament involving the strongest male players playing against each other at the best available facilities, with almost all of the players selected in the 2023 MLC Domestic Player Draft. It is important to mention that the Minor Cricket League was introduced in the United States in 2021 to develop the 'gentleman's game' into more of a popular sport in the country.\n\nThis year, immediately following the World Cup, all six of the teams that participated in the MLC's historic debut season will return. Superstars from Afghanistan, Pakistan's Haris Rauf (San Francisco Unicorns), South Africa's Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings), Marco Jansen (Washington Freedom), and Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas), as well as Sunil Narine (LA Knight Riders) of the West Indies, have already been confirmed to compete.\n\nBangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan has been signed as well by the LA Knight Riders for the second season of the tournament. The MLC's games will be held in Grand Prairie Stadium, which is close to Dallas, Texas. The 7,200 seats in this recently refurbished cricket-specific stadium exceed the highest international accreditation standards for a grass wicket.\n\nFor Americans who love cricket, MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan has promised the 'best summer of cricket'.\n\nBeing a trailblazer in USA cricket broadcasting, Srinivasan has long questioned why not a single game played on USA soil was shown on his platform. That compelled him to establish the concept of MLC. After everything fell into place, Srinivasan made the decision. In order to develop a rich talent pool of players to support Minor and Major League Cricket in the US, the MLC is developing international-calibre stadiums, establishing elite junior academies, offering top-notch training facilities and creating high-performance paths.\n\nWith its six clubs and backing from well-known figures in the USA and Indian corporate worlds, the MLC was considered by observers to have all the makings of a successful league last year. ABC, NBC, CBS, and The New York Times are among the major American news networks that have taken an interest in the MLC. According to the league's statistics, it has 40 million views, 3 million likes, and 3 million comments on social media already.\n\nIn conclusion, MLC has transformed cricket in the USA by bringing unprecedented excitement, global appeal, and opportunities for young players. The Major League Cricket and the Minor League Cricket redefined the way the game is played and watched, captivating audiences with their explosive matches and star-studded lineups. As the popularity of MLC continues to soar, the power and significance in shaping the sport's evolution in the USA cannot be underestimated.",

USA is the co-host for one of the biggest sporting events in the world along with the Caribbean and it will also be a test of the International Cricket Council (ICC) trying to take the game deeper into the markets where cricket is not the first sport. The first big step from the ICC was to sanction a T20 League (Major League Cricket) and then make USA the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup and then build a modular stadium in New York to get the American public closer to the action.\n\nWith T20 World Cup, the second season of the MLC and a new Legends League (Legends Intercontinental T20 League) scheduled to be held in the USA, there is a systematic plan to slowly get the American public introduced to the sport. How long it will take for them to get used to... is everybody's guess but many cricketers, former and current, believe that it is a step in the right direction keeping the sport's qualification into the Olympics in mind, which will be played in Los Angeles.\n\nVirat Kohli, one of the biggest crowd pullers in the game currently, suggested that the T20 World Cup might be the star of the domino effect of what's to come in the future for the sport in the country. Kohli, who visited US Consulate in Mumbai before leaving for the tournament, said that he never thought cricket will get to USA in any format, but here we are.\n\n“Honestly, I never thought we would be playing cricket in any form in the States. But now it’s a reality. And that tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world and the United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first ones on a global scale to accept it, in a way, with the World Cup,\" Kohli said in a video shared by US Consulate.\n\n“I think it’s a great start. It’s the ideal way to begin and it’s going to have a huge impact, and in starting off a kind of a domino effect. I hope it carries on for a long period of time,” he added.\n\n“We have enough people from our regions to keep the game up and alive in the States and make the others more aware about what it feels like to play and watch cricket. And I think it’s got great potential, with the MLC as well. There is already franchise cricket happening there. So I think, it’s moving in the right direction,” Kohli further said.",

Ahmed is also the owner of America's largest cricket complex (Prairie View Cricket Complex) located on the outskirts of Houston, housing five turf-wicket grounds on its premises.\n\nThe closure of these investment rounds is a major shot in the arm for this cricket 'start-up'. As part of their deal with USA Cricket, MLC is under obligation to deliver six world-class cricket stadiums. Notably, MLC is under exclusive negotiating agreements with respective city governments in the greater Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco Bay area to construct multi-million-dollar cricket stadiums.\n\nThe procurement of funds in rounds A and A1 will add to the enterprise's financial muscle to materialise the deals presently under negotiations. MLC has already entered into a long-term lease for Airhogs Stadium near Dallas and is expected to start revamping the stadium for cricketing use this summer.\n\n\"The significant funding committed by an outstanding group of investors will allow Major League Cricket to build first-class facilities and accelerate the sport's development across the country, bringing world-class professional cricket to the world's largest sports market,\" said Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders, Major League Cricket in a statement.\n\n\"This investor group comprises leading business executives and successful tech entrepreneurs who have led some of the world's most prominent companies.

    "body": "US cricket is rising. After beating Pakistan and pushing India, the Americans have reached the last eight of the T20 World Cup. On Sunday, they play England.\n\nThe success comes at a time of vast growth for American cricket. The US, the co-host of the tournament, launched a professional league last year and added T20 cricket to the 2028 Olympics in LA.\n\nLong regarded as an oxymoron, cricket in America is being powered by serious financial backers. Its domestic championship, Major League Cricket, has secured investment from the CEO of Microsoft and the owners of four teams from the Indian Premier League, cricket’s sporting and commercial behemoth.\n\nAmerican cricket might only be emerging, but it is already a threat to the game in England. The US league clashes with the English season, and many stars – English and foreign – are choosing to play in America over Albion.\n\nLast year, World Cup winner Jason Roy exchanged his England contract for one in Major League Cricket. Sunil Narine, Surrey’s star overseas player, missed T20 Finals Day because he was playing for the LA Knight Riders. This month Pat Cummins, the captain of the Australian teams that won the One-Day World Cup and the World Test Championship, signed a four-year contract with the San Francisco Unicorns. Jos Buttler, the England One-Day and T20 captain, is also interested.\n\nThe worry for English cricket is that, financially, it won’t keep pace. The English teams, almost all owned centrally or by members, could struggle to match the wages Major League Cricket can offer the world’s best players. The pound, which has still not recovered from Brexit, remains weak against the dollar.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) currently has full control of the English summer, which allows it to manage players’ workloads and make strategic decisions to bolster the England team. But if cricket in the US flourishes, the ECB will almost certainly be forced to take private investment (probably from India) to keep salaries competitive. Such a financial model would imperil English cricket’s foundations.\n\nAmerican cricket has a lot of work to do, especially in infrastructure. The 34,000 seater stadium on Long Island (bigger than any ground in England) is only temporary, and its wicket and outfield were dreadful. And yet, as I queued for the shuttle after South Africa versus Netherlands, the Yanks in front of me – newcomers to this queer sport – were trying to buy more tickets.\n\nMainstream US culture is slowly catching on. The World Cup has been covered by the major TV networks and newspapers (even if the New York Times, rather unconventionally, reported that India had beaten Pakistan 119-113). There was even a note of congratulation to the US team issued by the White House.\n\nCricket won’t quite conquer the US – the country is too big, and the sports market too flooded – but it doesn’t need to sweep all aside to be a success. To undermine the English summer, cricket in the US only has to succeed in certain pockets of the country, among certain demographics. The South Asian diaspora in the US stands at over five million. That’s roughly equal to the total population of a major cricketing nation like New Zealand, and not far short of the countries in the West Indies.\n\nMajor League Cricket will include more matches next year, increasing the conflict with the English season. American cricket’s ties to India have brought rumours that the US could host an additional season of the Indian Premier League every year. That would draw even more of the world’s best players (including English ones) away from both domestic and international matches held in England.\n\nThe success of the T20 World Cup has fast-tracked this expansion. On Sunday, England and the US will compete in the last eight. After that, they’ll compete to control summer cricket.",
    "summary": "* Major League Cricket, the domestic championship of the US, has secured investment from the CEO of Microsoft and owners of four teams from the Indian Premier League.\n* The league has already attracted top players, including Jason Roy, Sunil Narine, and Pat Cummins, who have chosen to play in America over England.\n* The financial backing of Major League Cricket is a threat to English cricket, as it can offer higher wages to the world's best players, potentially luring them away from the English season.\n* The league plans to increase the number of matches next year, which will clash with the English season, and there are rumors that the US could host an additional season of the Indian Premier League every year, drawing even more top players away from England.\n* The success of the US team in the T20 World Cup has fast-tracked the expansion of American cricket, and the growth of Major League Cricket is likely to continue, potentially undermining the English summer.",

    "date": "Sat Jun 22 15:23:50 2024",
    "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) has completed its Domestic Supplementary Draft, filling the remaining roster spots for the upcoming season. Team USA’s Aaron Jones, Chaitanya Bishnoi, and Sunny Patel were the three lucky players selected. The draft comes after a successful inaugural MLC season and on the heels of Team USA’s impressive performance in the ongoing T20 World Cup.\n\nJones Back with the Seattle Orcas\n\nTeam USA vice-captain Aaron Jones secured a familiar spot with the Seattle Orcas. Jones, a top-order batsman, was a key player for the Orcas in the inaugural MLC season. His recent heroics with Team USA in the T20 World Cup, including a crucial performance in the historic win over Pakistan, undoubtedly influenced the Orcas’ decision.\n\nFans in Seattle can expect more of the same high-octane batting displays from Jones throughout the upcoming MLC season.\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi Joins LA Knight Riders\n\nLA Knight Riders opted for Chaitanya Bishnoi, a 29-year-old top-order batsman and spin bowler. Bishnoi boasts an impressive cricketing background, having played for the Chennai Super Kings in the 2018 Indian Premier League (IPL) before moving to the United States in 2023.\n\nHe quickly made his mark on American cricket, featuring in all five matches for the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural MLC season and playing a pivotal role for the Dallas Xforia Giants in Minor League Cricket last year. Bishnoi’s versatility with both bat and ball promises to be an asset for the LA Knight Riders.\n\nMI New York Welcomes Sunny Patel\n\nRounding out the draft picks is Sunny Patel, who joins the MI New York roster. Patel, a right-handed middle-order batsman and leg-spinner, impressed in the 2023 Minor League Cricket season. His all-around performance was instrumental in leading the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers to the Championship match.\n\nPatel brings a unique skill set to MI New York, becoming their sole domestic leg-spinner for the upcoming season, adding variety to their bowling attack.\n\nEnthusiasm for Domestic Talent\n\nMajor League Cricket Tournament Director, Justin Geale, expressed his delight at the selection of these talented domestic players. “We are thrilled to welcome Chaitanya, Aaron, and Sunny to the 2024 MLC season,” Geale said in a press release. “Major League Cricket plays a critical role in developing domestic players and providing a pathway to play cricket at the highest level.”\n\nThe second season of MLC kicks off on July 5th with a doubleheader. Reigning champions MI New York will face the Seattle Orcas in Morrisville, North Carolina, followed by the Texas Super Kings taking on the LA Knight Riders in Grand Prairie, Texas. With sell-out crowds witnessed during the inaugural season, MLC is encouraging fans to secure their tickets early for the upcoming season. Ticket options cater to a wide range of budgets, with general admission starting at $30.\n\nThe excitement extends beyond the on-field action. Fans can expect a vibrant atmosphere with entertainment, fireworks, giveaways, player meet-and-greets, merchandise opportunities, food trucks, and more throughout the tournament. With the addition of these talented domestic players and a focus on fan engagement, the second season of Major League Cricket promises to be an exciting one.",

More such venues are on the way.\n\nGrand Prairie’s 7,200-seat stadium is home to the Texas Super Kings, one of the six teams that played in the U.S.’ Major League Cricket during its inaugural season last year. About 50,000 people attended games during the two-week season and postseason, Grand Prairie City Manager Bill Hills told The New York Times.\n\nInvestors are increasingly interested in the growing audience for cricket, the world’s second-most-popular sport, which has an especially large South Asian audience, the NYT reported. Major League Cricket franchises the San Francisco Unicorns, the Los Angeles Knight Riders and the Seattle Orcas and their backers are all moving toward building new venues within the next few years.\n\nThe turnout to a dozen cricket games in Grand Prairie last year exceeded expectations, Hills told the NYT. The three-day playoffs in July generated $1.7M in economic activity, including hospitality, retail, dining and entertainment, he said.\n\n“Who would have thought a city like Grand Prairie would host international sporting events” watched by millions, Hills told the NYT.\n\nGrand Prairie in 2020 greenlighted plans to turn its former minor league baseball venue into the first Major League Cricket stadium in the country, hoping to capitalize on the 15 to 20 million cricket fans who were already estimated to be in the U.S.\n\nTwo years later, a group led by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gave Major League Cricket $120M to fund the construction of stadiums and training centers and host global cricket events in the U.S. over the following decade.\n\nThat vision is now coming to life as Major League Cricket zeroes in on building more 7,000-to-10,000-seat stadiums in areas that could bloom into entertainment districts, the NYT reported.\n\nCricket stadiums make a great anchor to attract people, David Demarest, who leads the sports and entertainment development group at JLL, told the NYT. That was part of the vision in Grand Prairie.\n\n“No question it is going to be something that can serve as a springboard to development. It is located in an opportunity zone,” Marty Wieder, former Grand Prairie director of economic development, said in 2022.\n\nThe city planned to draw on the 100,000 or so Indian American people living in DFW.\n\nAbout 250,000 people originally from India or elsewhere in South Asia live in the San Francisco Bay Area, Unicorns General Manager David White said of a proposed stadium in the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds. The Santa Clara site also hopes to attract a Major League Soccer stadium and more to become a sports and entertainment hub, the NYT reported.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas plan to build a stadium at Marymoor Park in Redmond, Washington, near Bellevue, and the Los Angeles Knight Riders are eyeing a spot at the Great Park in Irvine, California.\n\nVijay Srinivasan, a Bay Area entrepreneur who founded a cricket pay television channel, told the NYT the lack of cricket infrastructure in the U.S. is the main thing holding it back from hosting the most competitive games.\n\nEven so, Major League Cricket’s short season allowed many of the sport’s top players, including Australia's Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Pat Cummins, to play in the U.S. league last year.",

The 6,000-person venue replaced the former home of the professional baseball team, the AirHogs. Anurag Jain, the managing partner of venture capitalist firm Perot Jain, is part-owner of the Texas Super Kings and founded the Dallas-based franchise earlier this year in hopes of creating a buzz stateside.\n\nMore from Robb Report\n\nThe Texas Food Scene Can't Decide Whether It Wants a Michelin Guide\n\nA Thief Stole $600,000 Worth of Wine From This L.A.

But not at the professional level and that’s what I really wanted to change.”\n\nCricket is currently ranked as the second-biggest sport in the world right behind soccer, and Jain’s not the only one betting on its future. Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside business mogul Jay Mehta, acquired the Knight Riders back in 2020 and has plans to build his own state-of-the-art cricket stadium 40 miles outside L.A. The $30 million venture is being spearheaded by Major League Cricket and designed by award-winning architecture firm HKS.\n\nHistorically, the bat and ball sport has struggled to develop a fan base outside of India, South Africa, Australia, and the U.K. However, deep-pocketed investors are willing to put an impressive $120 million into the U.S. league to expand its profile in America, Bloomberg reported.\n\nOf course, with this kind of financial backing, cricketers from across the globe want in on the action. The Texas Super Kings have since signed overseas players including Devon Conway, Dwayne Bravo, and David Miller. Veteran South African batter Faf du Plessis has also joined the team as captain, while West Indies spinner Sunil Narine leads the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n“American sports fans want to see the best in the world,” MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport. “That’s the demand in U.S. professional sports.”\n\nSign up for Robb Report's Newsletter.

    "body": "The Indian Premier League franchises could soon make their presence felt in England too as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) president Mark Nicholas has revealed that as many as five IPL franchises have expressed interest in acquiring a stake in London Spirit. The London-based outfit is one of the eight teams competing in The Hundred.\n\nThe IPL franchises are associated with a number of T20 leagues across the globe. They have teams in the Caribbean Premier League, Major League Cricket, ILT20 as well as SA20. And they could soon have their own teams in England as well.\n\nMark Nicholas revealed the IPL franchises' plans while announcing the plans for the World Cricket Connects symposium at Lord's. The ace commentator is set to take over as London Spirit's chairman in October this year. Recently, MCC CEO Guy Lavender wrote a letter to the club members to seek their approval for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)'s offer to privatize a 49 percent stake in the Spirit.\n\nWhile Nicholas did not reveal the names of the IPL franchises, he made it clear that they are interested in associating with The Hundred. The stakeholders will be finalized through a bidding process while the remaining 51 percent will remain with the franchise.\n\n\"What we are putting to a vote is to accept the ECB’s offer of a 51% share of this franchise,\" Nicholas told ESPNCricinfo.\n\n\"We will always be a members’ club. The first target is membership harmony [because] as a member you are entitled to a view. It’s very easy to knock people back because they’re difficult, but actually there is quite a lot of good thinking that comes out of activism. You have to treat people with respect, and hear their view,\" he added.\n\nThe Hundred has given us another opportunity: Mark Nicholas\n\nThe ECB is planning to privatize the Hundred. The board is planning to privatize the competition by creating eight new companies and gifting 51% of the shares in them to the relevant host county.

He further stated that The Hundred has given the ECB another opportunity to make amends.\n\n\"We missed out on T20 in 2003 where we could have grabbed it,” said Nicholas. \"India thought quicker than us (on the IPL) and were smarter than us, as India often is. India moves at an extraordinary pace to make things work.\n\n\"So the Hundred has given us another opportunity. The [MCC] membership quite likes being part of the chat, not being consigned to a piece of history. The members I talk to really love the idea of having a team, love the opportunity that it brings.

The second edition of MLC is set to commence right after the 2024 T20 World Cup concludes.\n\nFollowing a successful inaugural season, the 2024 MLC will feature a significant influx of Australian players. Notable names such as Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, and Pat Cummins are expected to join the American league, which will gain considerable attention after co-hosting the World Cup.\n\nTravis Head was also slated to be part of the Australian contingent for MLC, having been signed by the Washington Freedom, a team coached by Ricky Ponting and featuring fellow Australian Steve Smith.\n\nBut with a hectic schedule ahead, including five tough matches against India this year, Cricket Australia is not confident of Head’s participation in the MLC.\n\nMoreover, Head’s recent form in red-ball cricket has been disappointing, with untouchable performances in the home series against Pakistan and the West Indies, and the tour of New Zealand in 2024. He averaged just 24.78 in eight Test innings in which he split, despite hitting a hundred and the experience of a couple of ducks.\n\n“We typically support players pursuing opportunities outside the Australian season where the international schedule, playing loads and fitness allows. However, each NOC request is assessed on an individual basis as will be the case coming out of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.” a CA spokesperson told The Age.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Head also participated in the entire 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season with the SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH).\n\nAustralia has a packed schedule ahead to keep the versatile Head engaged\n\nAustralia’s first international engagement after the 2024 T20 World Cup is a white-ball tour of Scotland and England. They will start their home season with a white-ball series against Pakistan, followed by the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India.\n\nThe 2024 MLC is scheduled from July 6 to July 29, with defending champions MI New York facing the Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last year’s final.",

    "date": "Sun Jun  2 18:00:47 2024",
    "body": "Location. Weather. Facilities. People. In four words, you have the summary of why Texas has become the hub of cricket in America.\n\n“It’s not even a question,” says USA player and Texas resident Andries Gous. “It’s 100% Texas. Whether it’s tournaments, games, camps or whatever it is that’s being held - it’s in Texas.”\n\nGous himself was born and raised in South Africa but joined the many players from around the world who moved to the USA with the advent of Major League Cricket. At first he lived in Seattle before making the move to the Lone Star State, and in particular, to Dallas.\n\n“I definitely moved for the stadium,” says Gous, talking about Dallas’s Grand Prairie facility, which will host four matches during this World Cup, including the opening fixture between USA and Canada. “I can practise at the stadium and there’s now outdoor nets being built. The facilities are just better in Dallas at the moment.\n\n“I’m a bit different to the other guys because I play tournaments outside the country, so I need some proper facilities throughout the year. Other people [elsewhere in the United States] will be stuck indoors whereas I can train outdoors [in Texas], which is what I need.”\n\nFor players, Texas represents the result of a “build it and they will come” philosophy. Dallas and Houston both now have infrastructure that attracts players domestically and from overseas. In the last year alone, more than a dozen cricketers, both international and domestic, have moved to one of the two cities.\n\nBut that doesn’t completely answer why the venue was built there in the first place.\n\n“We looked all over the country,” explains Justin Geale, tournament director for MLC, who have leased and developed the Grand Prairie facility in Dallas, completed less than a year ago.\n\n“The original thought was that it’s probably easier to convert a baseball stadium,” he says. The search for one such was extensive. “I’d be surprised if there’s a Minor League stadium in the country that’s closed or for sale that we didn’t know about.”\n\nIndeed, Grand Prairie was formerly home to the Texas AirHogs baseball team, who folded in 2020 following the Covid-19 pandemic. MLC saw the opportunity and convinced the local government of the value of a new stadium on the site.\n\nThe city of Grand Prairie owns the stadium and MLC has an exclusive lease to it. All the upgrades that have taken place, at a cost of US$21 million, have been funded by the investors and teams within MLC.\n\nThe actual site had enough space for a renovated stadium to be built, and practice facilities are now being added immediately outside it. But beyond that, Texas itself was an attractive location due its central location in the US (only three or four hours by flight from most places in the country), its climate, and a large South Asian diaspora.\n\n“The location is really important,” Geale explains. “It’s about 15-20 minutes from Dallas-Fort Worth airport, so it’s in a really accessible spot in a major city in Texas. Also, the weather means you can play around ten months of the year. So there’s an awful lot going for it from a geography standpoint, and also a demographic standpoint.”\n\nA key part of US cricket’s recent history involves Vijay Srinivasan and Sameer Mehta, co-founders of American Cricket Enterprises, which operates MLC, and crucially, are also co-founders of Willow TV, a 24x7 cricket channel in the US that broadcasts all major cricketing events in the country. Using their subscriber data allowed them to pinpoint where in the US would be best suited to building the nation’s cricketing hubs, which, unsurprisingly, were areas with large South Asian populations.\n\n“That was one of the things we looked at when allocating markets and thinking where this might work,” Geale says. “It’s a pretty expensive business so it makes sense to go for lower-hanging fruit, which is people that love the game, to start with, and building out from there.”\n\nDallas already boasted a number of indoor facilities, and it is estimated that there are over 1000 juniors playing cricket in the area. Furthermore, a Sixes Social Cricket bar is situated just north of the city, one of only two locations outside the UK where the cricket-themed bar has a venue.\n\n“I don’t think people know actually how much cricket there is in this country,” said Gous in an interview with the Washington Freedom franchise last summer. “It’s ridiculous. Everywhere in the country there’s cricket. If you want to play 12 months a year, you’ll find it.”\n\n“Until four or five years back,” says Dhandapani Devarasan, the head coach of the Dallas-based Mustang Cricket Academy, “many parents asked me what is the future of cricket here. Now, no one is asking.”\n\nMustang is owned by Lovkesh Kalia, who moved to the area in 1999. “When I arrived, we had eight teams and we all knew each other,” he reminisces. “Now there are probably more than 200 games being played every weekend. It’s amazing. And there are grounds popping up everywhere.\n\n“Literally the other week two new grounds came up, and now Celina is putting up two grounds. Prosper is putting up two grounds,” he says, referring to two towns north of Dallas. “And the reason they’re doing it is because they’ve figured out that South Asians migrate and cricket is very, very important to them. And there’s been a tremendous amount of migration in those places north of Dallas, so the cities are putting up cricket grounds. Before we had to beg them. Now they’re saying, ‘We have a cricket ground for you. Come down here.’ The growth has been tremendous.”\n\nWhile the growth has been exponential, the sport, at a recreational level at least, remains one that is played almost exclusively by the South Asian diaspora. According to Kalia, 99% of children playing in Dallas are of South Asian heritage. The question is whether that matters. After all, America is a massive country with a population of 335 million. And while those with Indian heritage make up just 1.4% of that figure, that’s 4.5 million people - only about 500,000 fewer than the population of New Zealand.\n\nAs such, the US boasts a passionate but diluted fan base that is spread across a country the size of a continent. But now, with children who are second- or third-generation Americans growing up and playing the sport their parents knew and loved, it is burgeoning and excelling in specific locations. Comparisons or questions about whether cricket will become the new baseball are lazy ones. It never has been, nor will it ever be the goal to make it that.\n\n“It’s such a big market, but I think we need to tap that community first,” Geale says. “But I genuinely do think there is an opportunity to grow a wider base because I don’t think you want to become just known as a sport played by immigrants. I think it’s probably taken Major League Soccer 20 years to shake that tag and become more mainstream. I think we need to tap that. We can go after new fans as well. But yeah, to say we’re going to be Major League Baseball is ridiculous.”\n\nThe plan now is for the USA national team to base themselves at Grand Prairie in the near future. There have also been discussions with English counties about the prospect of pre-season training camps being held in the city. But the ultimate aim is for Dallas to be the location where teams touring the West Indies add a handful of fixtures on to the end or start of a tour to play a strong US national team.\n\n“We’re building a high-performance centre,” says Geale. “And players really enjoy their time here. It’s a great place to bring the family and the golf clubs.",

Ahead of the second season of the league, the Australian skipper has been signed by the San Francisco Unicorns franchise.

With Cummins’ signing, it is expected that he will lead the side.\n\nPat Cummins set to lead San Francisco Unicorns\n\nDue to his workload, Cummins has not preferred to play much league cricket since 2019. He last played in the BBL in 2019, and since then, the IPL has been the sole league where he has participated. Now, Major League Cricket has been added to his schedule. MLC 2024 will kick off on July 6 (IST), and this window won’t witness much international cricket, as the T20 World Cup will conclude a week prior to MLC’s start.\n\nSince becoming Australia’s Test captain in 2021, Pat Cummins has been on a successful journey. During his tenure, Cummins has won The Ashes, the ICC World Test Championship, and the ICC World Cup. Recognizing his prowess as a skipper, he was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for a whopping 20.5 crore rupees. He performed brilliantly in the IPL 2024 season, leading SRH to a runner-up finish. Now, the San Francisco-based franchise has also placed their trust in him.\n\nHow did the San Francisco Unicorns fare in MLC 2023?\n\nLast season, under Aaron Finch’s captaincy, the team finished in 5th place in the 6-franchise tournament. The Unicorns won 2 of their 5 league games and missed out on the playoffs due to a low run rate. The current roster of the Unicorns features many star players, including Corey Anderson, Haris Rauf, Jake Fraser-McGurk, and Josh Inglis.

The 31-year-old ICC Men’s Cricketer of the Year and Wisden’s Leading Cricketer in the World for 2023 is already lauded as an all-time great fast bowler and will be a game-changing addition to the Unicorns roster for the 2024 season.\n\nIn an MLC first, the fast bowler, who also captains IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad, has signed to the Unicorns for a four-year period, offering the team and league a significant vote of confidence as it looks to build out the franchise’s popularity with success on the pitch and the development of its cricket stadium in the Bay Area.\n\nWith pace bowling expertise set to complement the Unicorn’s fast bowling attack, which already features international class in Pakistan’s Haris Rauf and New Zealand’s Matt Henry, Cummins has shown himself to be a handy lower-order batter in the short format of T20, once holding the IPL record for the fastest to fifty runs, taking him just 14 balls.\n\n“I’m very excited to join the Unicorns ahead of the 2024 season,” said Cummins. “MLC is developing at a rapid rate, and the US market potential is huge for cricket.”\n\nThe Unicorns are co-owned by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Anand Rajamaran and Venky Harinarayan, who have shared a number of successful tech ventures, most notably founding and selling database technology provider Junglee, which was sold to Amazon in 1998 for $250m.\n\n“While cricket is integral to my involvement, the global network and long-term possibilities offered by the owners specifically, and Silicon Valley more broadly presented a unique opportunity for me and my life beyond cricket,” added Cummins.\n\n“Anand [Rajaraman] and Venky [Harinarayan] operate in a business world that excites me enormously and I can’t wait to be a part of it.”\n\nThis latest signing comes after MLC recently received List A status from the world cricket governing body, the ICC. The league is now regarded as an official T20 tournament, with playing records now counted towards official format statistics.\n\n“Pat Cummins has been one of the world’s great players across all formats for a number of years now and we are thrilled to welcome him to the Unicorns family,” said San Francisco Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman.\n\n“Pat’s commitment to a long-term contract demonstrates his faith in our vision for growing cricket in the Bay Area and more broadly across the US.

    "body": "The Australian skipper Pat Cummins is prepared for his next assignment in the USA for the upcoming season of Major League Cricket (MLC). The financial allure of the tournament is notable, with average players earning up to INR 2.5 crore for seven games and a couple of final matches. In comparison, Cummins earned approximately INR 1.8 crore per match during the recent IPL 2024 season.\n\nFor this MLC season, Cummins has been signed by the San Francisco Unicorns. The team’s lead investors, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, are ardent fans of Cummins, and their admiration goes beyond his cricketing prowess.\n\n“Of course, we’re huge fans of Pat Cummins and really wanted him to join the team, but what really helps us out is how tech-savvy and forward-thinking he is. He’s considering his career beyond cricket and is interested in the intersection of technology and cricket, even after his playing days,” Rajaraman told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nALSO READ: White House Applauds USA Cricket Team’s Historic T20 World Cup 2024 Performance\n\nThe alignment of interests in technology played a significant role in bringing Cummins to the Unicorns. The team has connections with prominent figures in the tech industry, including the CEOs of YouTube and Adobe, offering Cummins a unique opportunity to explore Silicon Valley’s innovative environment. Cummins’ manager, Neil Maxwell, emphasized this learning aspect as a major draw for the cricketer.\n\n“He’s a very curious individual who enjoys learning about new things. The range of people connected to this franchise, including high-profile tech CEOs, opens up Silicon Valley to him,” Neil Maxwell explained.\n\nAdditionally, the San Francisco Unicorns are supported by Cricket Victoria, while Cummins’ home state, New South Wales (NSW), backs Washington Freedom. The Unicorns’ investors approached Cricket Victoria’s chief, Nick Cummins, about the signing.\n\nALSO READ: Virat Kohli Prepares for Afghanistan Clash Amid Struggles; Possible Inclusion of Kuldeep Yadav\n\nNick clarified that while Pat is not seeking more cricket-playing opportunities, the chance to delve into Silicon Valley’s tech scene made the offer appealing. The move to the MLC not only broadens Pat Cummins’ cricketing horizons but also allows him to engage with cutting-edge technology and forward-thinking individuals, aligning perfectly with his post-cricket aspirations.",

We hope that this inspires boys and girls around the country to pick up a bat and ball this summer, and encourages sports fans to attend an MLC game or tune into the broadcast,” Srinivasan said as quoted by the MLC release.\n\n“The USA’s advancement to the Super 8 means they’ll automatically qualify for the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, providing Major League Cricket with a strong platform for continued growth,” he added.",

Seattle is the only small market franchise in MLC, but have ties with IPL franchise Delhi Capitals.\n\n\"Atlanta and Chicago...there's very, very strong communities in those markets that have been very passionate about cricket, so those would be very logical markets for us to be looking at,\" Srinivasan said.\n\n\"I think there's a list of about four or five (cities) that are being considered right now.\"\n\nA move across the border could also be on the cards although might be complicated with Canada boasting its own fledgling T20 league.\n\n\"Vancouver and Toronto has a history of being in U.S. sports. Do I expect Vancouver and Toronto (as part of an expansion)? Absolutely,\" Seattle Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar told me.\n\n\"Locations with potential in terms of expansion will have a cricket loving diaspora in larger cities. Houston is also a location that I could see probably having a team.\"\n\nSomasegar believed a greater depth of American talent needed to emerge before an expansion.\n\nAs I reported recently, teams in the upcoming season will be allowed six overseas players per starting eleven, which is more than the quota of four accepted in established leagues. It is believed MLC is targeting to comply with International Cricket Council regulations in the coming seasons.\n\n\"We need to build a larger cadre of domestic players,\" Somasegar said. \"We need to go figure out how we are going to continue to both cultivate and nurture existing domestic players, and really broaden the footprint for domestic players.\"\n\nForbesMajor League Cricket Enters Pivotal Second Season\n\nThe ultimate vision is for more teams, more games and a season lasting around six weeks from early June-mid July, helping to avoid clashing with the Hundred competition in the U.K.\n\nMLC officials and owners want a home-and-away season - where the teams play each other twice - to underpin the competition, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds.\n\nLike last year, the entire tournament will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina. There had been hope that New York's $30 modular stadium built for the ongoing T20 World Cup could host games in MLC, but that was not possible.\n\nForbesNew York Cricket Stadium Set To Cost $30 Million As Anticipation Builds For T20 World Cup\n\n\"We were very optimistic that we could use the infrastructure, but a variety of logistical reasons proved too difficult,\" Srinivasan said. \"Obviously a bit disappointing, we would have loved to bring MLC to the New York region, which has a team, and it would really have been a great way to jump start all of that.\"\n\nThe 34,000-seat stadium in Eisenhower Park in Long Island is already being torn down with the U.S. leg of the T20 World Cup complete. As I reported previously, discussions are being held over third party use of the facility post the tournament.\n\n\"If it is available next year and it is a viable venue, we would absolutely explore it,\" Srinivasan said.\n\nThe sheen of the New York spectacle marked by the sold-out India-Pakistan blockbuster coupled with underdog U.S.' stirring performances is hoped to carry momentum into a pivotal second season of MLC.\n\nForbesCricket T20 World Cup Hoped To Return To The U.S. Within A Decade\n\n\"What the World Cup is doing is bringing a lot of attention to this sport. I think we can ride the momentum,\" Srinivasan said.\n\n\"The World Cup will come and go. But we are here to stay.\"",
    "summary": "**Current Status:** The MLC has completed its inaugural season with 6 teams: Texas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C, Seattle, and New York.\n\n**Expansion Plans:** There is no specific timeline for expansion, but the MLC hopes to reach 10 teams in the long term, with Chicago, Atlanta, and Canadian cities (Vancouver and Toronto) being possible expansion locations. Houston is also considered a potential location.\n\n**Requirements for Expansion:** Before expanding, the MLC wants to develop a larger pool of American cricket talent and cultivate domestic players.\n\n**Season Structure:** The upcoming season will feature 6 overseas players per team, with a goal to comply with International Cricket Council regulations in the future. The ultimate vision is for a 6-week season from early June to mid-July, with a home-and-away format, but this will depend on all teams having their own home grounds.\n\n**Current Season:** The entire tournament will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina, with hopes to use the new modular stadium in New York in the future.\n\n**Outlook:** The MLC is riding the momentum from the T20 World Cup and hopes to build on its success in the second season, with a focus on developing American cricket talent and expanding the league in the long term.",

    "date": "Tue Jun  4 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "In a landmark move, Australia's Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins will feature in the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC). The 31-year-old fast bowler has signed with the San Francisco Unicorns, a franchise that maintains a strategic partnership with Victoria's first-class cricket setup in Australia. Cummins’ decision to participate in the MLC marks a significant step into the T20 franchise world, having recently led Hyderabad to the final of the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nCummins has been on a relentless cricketing journey since mid-February, juggling commitments between the Australian national team and the IPL. His MLC stint, commencing just five days after the conclusion of the World Cup, will cap off an intense period of cricket that began with Australia’s tour of New Zealand earlier this year. Cummins, renowned for his blistering pace, deceptive slower balls, pinpoint yorkers, and valuable lower-order batting, will undoubtedly bolster the Unicorns’ lineup. His presence is expected to be a game-changer, not only for the Unicorns but also for the overall talent pool of MLC players.\n\nStar-Studded International Signings\n\nCummins’ signing is part of a larger trend of high-profile international players joining MLC's six teams: Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom, and San Francisco Unicorns. This wave of signings underscores MLC’s growing reputation as a premier T20 league.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Bangladesh's veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, South African power-hitter David Miller, Irish fast-bowler Josh Little, Indian wicketkeeper-batter Adithya Ganesh, and Afghani spinner Waqar Salamkheil.\n\nMI New York: West Indian all-rounder Romario Shepherd and South African fast bowler Anrich Nortje.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Alongside Cummins, Australian wicketkeeper Josh Inglis, emerging batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk, and hard-hitting West Indian Sherfane Rutherford.\n\nSeattle Orcas: Fast bowlers West Indian Obed McCoy, South African Nandre Burger, and Australians Nathan Ellis and Lance Morris.\n\nTexas Super Kings: New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell, South African T20 captain Aiden Markram, Australian all-rounder Aaron Hardie, and Afghanistan's speedster Naveen ul Haq.\n\nWashington Freedom: Batting talents Steve Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Jack Edwards, and New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra.\n\nHistorically, Cummins has been selective about participating in T20 franchise cricket, making his decision to join MLC particularly noteworthy. This move signals MLC’s growing stature and its ability to attract top-tier international talent. Cummins joins a cadre of fellow Australians, including Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith, and Jake Fraser-McGurk, who have signed on for MLC’s second season. Rumors also suggest that Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, and other members of Australia’s World Cup squad may also be heading stateside.\n\nThe second season of MLC begins on July 5 with an exciting doubleheader. Defending champions MI New York will face off against Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season’s finale in Morrisville. Later that day, Texas Super Kings will play their home game against the LA Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in the Dallas Metro area. Cummins’ participation in MLC not only enhances the league's competitive edge but also reinforces its position on the global T20 stage. As the MLC continues to attract cricket's biggest names, fans can look forward to an electrifying season filled with high-octane action and stellar performances.\n\nTune In",
    "summary": "* Australian Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins has signed with the San Francisco Unicorns for the second season of MLC, marking a significant move into the T20 franchise world.\n* Cummins' participation in MLC is a significant development, especially given his recent leadership of Hyderabad to the final of the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL).\n* Cummins' signing is part of a larger trend of high-profile international players joining MLC teams, including Shakib Al Hasan, David Miller, Romario Shepherd, and Steve Smith, among others.\n* The six teams in MLC are: Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom, and San Francisco Unicorns.\n* The second season of MLC begins on July 5 with a doubleheader featuring defending champions MI New York vs. Seattle Orcas and Texas Super Kings vs. LA Knight Riders.\n* Cummins' presence in MLC is expected to bolster the Unicorns' lineup and enhance the league's competitive edge, reinforcing its position on the global T20 stage.",

Australia, as per the Future Tours Programme, are due to tour the West Indies for an all-format series - two Tests, three ODIs, three T20Is - in June-July next year. As Australia's Test and ODI captain, how Cummins' availability for either assignment might be affected remains to be seen. He does not lead in T20I cricket, but recently captained his IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL 2024 final.\n\nHard-hitting Australian batter Jake Fraser-McGurk will join Cummins at San Francisco Unicorns this season. Washington Freedom is another franchise that has signed a number of high-profile Australians, including Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Steven Smith.

However, his motivations extend beyond the sport itself.\n\nThe “global network and long-term possibilities” offered by the franchise’s Silicon Valley-based owners are particularly enticing to Cummins.\n\nHe sees an opportunity to engage with the business world beyond his cricketing career and is eager to collaborate with the franchise’s co-owners, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, who are prominent figures in the tech industry.\n\nInternational Cricket vs MLC Commitments\n\nThe MLC season runs from July 6th to 29th this year. This timeframe coincides with Australia’s scheduled tour of the West Indies in June-July next year, raising questions about Cummins’ availability for the international matches.\n\nAs Australia’s Test and ODI captain, his presence on that tour would be crucial. While the impact on his T20I involvement remains to be seen, Cummins recently captained the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL 2024 final, so a complete T20I absence seems unlikely.\n\nMLC boasts star-studded roster\n\nCummins joins a growing list of high-profile cricketers signing with MLC franchises. The San Francisco Unicorns also secured the services of Australian batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk.\n\nAnother MLC team, the Washington Freedom, boasts a strong Australian contingent with Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, and the legendary Steven Smith joining their ranks. This influx of international talent further strengthens the MLC’s position as a rising force in global cricket.\n\nMLC Gains Official Recognition from ICC\n\nThe MLC’s second season brings an exciting development: List A status. This prestigious designation, previously only held by the UAE’s ILT20 among Associate-run franchise competitions, recognizes the MLC as an official T20 league. This means statistics recorded during MLC matches will now count towards official T20 player records.\n\nWith Pat Cummins leading the charge, the MLC is poised for a spectacular season, attracting top international talent and gaining official recognition. This innovative league is undoubtedly changing the landscape of T20 cricket across the globe.",

    "body": "Australian cricket superstar Pat Cummins is all set to make waves in the USA's Major League Cricket (MLC) as the latest high-profile signing for the next edition of the tournament after the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his Australian compatriots like Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith, and Jake Fraser-McGurk, Cummins is all set to make his MLC debut this season.\n\nAccording to Cricbuzz, Cummins, who led the Australian cricket team to victory in the World Test Championship Final and the ODI World Cup against India, has been signed by the San Francisco Unicorns for the second edition of the MLC 2024.\n\nPat Cummins to make MLC debut after stellar IPL 2024 campaign\n\nCummins is expected to fill the void left by Aaron Finch's retirement, as the Aussie speedster will be the new captain of the San Francisco Unicorns. Cummins, who led the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) to the IPL 2024 Final, will join forces with fellow Australians Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk in the San Francisco Unicorns lineup for the upcoming MLC 2024.\n\nThis move added to an already grueling schedule for Cummins that commenced with Australia's tour of New Zealand in February 2024. It is being said that Australia’s T20I captain Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, and several Australians from their T20 World Cup 2024 squad are also expected to make entry to the three-week franchise competition in America.\n\nNotably, the Australian fast bowler recently shined as a captain on his debut IPL season. However, the SRH lost the IPL 2024 final to the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) last month, but Cummins' leadership credentials were praised highly by the former cricketers and cricket experts. He was also impressive with the ball for the SRH in the IPL 2024, taking 18 wickets.\n\nMLC 2024 to start next month in the USA\n\nWell, the upcoming MLC 2024 is scheduled to kick off on July 5 in the USA, just days after the conclusion of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2024. The MLC recently earned List-A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) and joined the ranks of elite Associate-run franchise competitions after UAE's International League T20 (ILT20).\n\nThe second edition of the MLC promises an enthralling start, with defending champions MI New York locking horns with runners-up Seattle Orcas at Church Street Park in Morrisville on July 5. The opening day festivities will feature a doubleheader, with the Texas Super Kings squaring off against the LA Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nNotably, the Australian cricket team is currently gearing up for the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024 in the USA and West Indies and Cummins is expected to play a crucial role in their campaign. Australia is slotted alongside England, Namibia, Oman, and Scotland in Group B at the 2024 T20 World Cup.",

He scored 94 runs in only 40 deliveries to help the USA start the T20 World Cup 2024 campaign on a positive note. He is hoping that his inning against Canada will open the eyes of those who don't know anything about him or USA cricket.

He was not picked in the last MLC draft.\n\nRead Also: Most Sixes in the T20 World Cup\n\nAaron Jones and Andries Gous led the USA to their victory against Canada\n\n\"When I wasn't selected in the Major League, I just took it as a stepping stone in the journey. I would have loved to get drafted, so it goes sometimes. Hopefully, tonight's innings will probably open the eyes of those who don't know me or USA cricket. We have great players here and we have a lot of talent here and are willing to play at the highest level for sure,\" Aaron Jones said after the game.\n\nUSA had a poor start and they lost the wicket of Steven Taylor for a duck in the second ball of the inning. They were 42/2 after 6.3 overs. But Jones played a counter-attacking inning and completed the chase with 14 balls to spare. He smashed 10 sixes in the game, the second most in a T20 World Cup inning after Chris Gayle's 11 against England in 2016.\n\nAndries Gous also played an important inning and was instrumental in USA's victory. He scored 65 runs off 46 balls and helped Aaron from the other end. Jones and Andries Gous stood tall and added 131 runs for the third wicket.\n\n\"I don't think it is easy to put it into words. We know Canada comes hard against us since it is a big rivalry. Happy to take the team over the line. Sometimes as a cricketer, you could go a bit under the radar if you have a few low scores. I always back myself and know that I am capable of performing at every level. Happy that I came out on top and won the game for the USA. Hope it opens the eyes of some people around the world that I am good enough to play T20 cricket. I believe in myself, I work hard and I just use it as motivation. I know that I'm good enough to play at the highest level, and whenever given the opportunity, I'll do my best for sure,\" Jones further added.\n\nUSA will next face Pakistan at the same venue on Thursday and play India in ten days, while Canada will face Ireland in New York on Friday. Jones said they will continue to play fearless cricket.",

As part of the deal, GMR would control several assets including the Utilita Bowl, a Hilton hotel, and an 18-hole golf course near the Hampshire cricket ground. This strategic move further solidifies their position in global cricket management.\n\nECB's call for overseas investment in The Hundred\n\nEarlier this year, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) invited overseas investors to get a stake in The Hundred. Following this invitation, 18 counties were approached for privatization. However, only Hampshire have successfully secured a deal so far. Other IPL franchises such as Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Lucknow Super Giants, and Rajasthan Royals are also reportedly in discussions with other counties.\n\nPotential format change for The Hundred\n\nIn another development, the ECB has initiated discussions about potentially changing the format of The Hundred, England's 100-ball competition. Despite its four-year history, the 100-ball matches have not been as successful as anticipated. While there are no plans to alter the competition's branding, it could be transformed into T20 matches in the future. This potential change is being considered in light of increased interest from IPL franchises in owning teams within The Hundred.",

    "title": "Former England Pacer James Anderson Targeted by Major League Cricket Franchise",
    "date": "Mon Sep 16 10:49:59 2024",
    "body": "James Anderson, the legendary pacer of England cricket, is making headlines once again as he potentially targets a spot in the burgeoning Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States. This speculation follows Anderson’s recent retirement from international cricket, wherein he claimed an impressive 704 Test wickets, marking the end of an era in the sport. At 42 years old, Anderson seems eager to explore the white-ball formats, hinting that his cricketing journey is far from over.\n\nAnderson, who officially hung up his boots in July 2024, has been a linchpin of English cricket for nearly two decades. His retirement has left a significant gap in the Test arena, but reports suggest that he could be lured back into the game through the fast-developing MLC.\n\nInterest from Major League Cricket Teams\n\nAccording to a report from BBC Sport, at least one MLC franchise is keenly pursuing the veteran bowler. This interest comes as Anderson expresses optimism about a potential return to white-ball cricket, particularly for the third edition of this exciting T20 tournament set to take place in 2025. With the MLC hailing impressive stature just two years since its launch, attracting notable internationals like Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, and Glenn Maxwell, the league has already begun to cement its credibility in the global cricket scene.\n\nThe MLC will expand to a remarkable 34 games in 2025 and has gained official List A status, enhancing its profile further. As a result, Anderson’s potential involvement could position him favorably within this rapidly growing league.\n\nFinancial Incentives and Career Rejuvenation\n\nThe prospect of engaging in the MLC offers enticing financial benefits for Anderson. Reports indicate that a stint in the league could yield earnings of approximately 135,000 euros for a brief tenure. This figure significantly overshadows the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) white-ball contract, which was recently valued at 70,000 euros—making the MLC increasingly appealing for cricketers looking to maximize their earnings while still enjoying the game.\n\nDespite not having played competitive T20 cricket since 2014, Anderson remains confident about his capabilities. He believes his physical fitness and skill set are sufficient to compete effectively in the fast-paced format. Meanwhile, since retirement, he has taken on a coaching role as the England men’s bowling consultant, preparing for forthcoming tours of Pakistan and New Zealand in the winter.\n\nReflections and Future Plans\n\nDuring an interview with Sky Sports, Anderson shared his insights on his new role: “At the minute, I’m due to go to Pakistan and New Zealand in the winter. Then nothing concrete after that.” He expressed his commitment to navigating this new chapter of his career: “I’m very new to this, I’m still learning as we go. It’s partly me trying to figure out if this is where I want to go with the next stage of my career and also for them to figure out if I’m any good at it as well.”\n\nHollywood Stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney Interested in Buying Stake in The Hundred Franchise Welsh Fire\n\nThe dual roles of coach and potential player in the MLC underscore Anderson’s multifaceted contributions to the sport, illustrating his desire to remain active within the cricketing world while also fostering the next generation of talent.",

    "title": "James Anderson Targets T20 Return With MLC",
    "date": "Tue Sep 17 13:52:26 2024",
    "body": "Perhaps James Anderson, England’s most successful Test bowler, could stage a sensational return to T20 cricket. With 704 Test wickets in an illustrious career, Anderson recently became a fast-bowling coach for England’s support staff. But recent reports indicate that he might return to T20 cricket this time, probably from Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States. So, let’s see what this means.\n\nJames Anderson’s Excellent Statistics\n\nJim Anderson resigned from international cricket with a fantastic Test career behind his name, and now he has been shortlisted for a role in Major League Cricket’s 2025 season. The interest of white-ball cricket in Jim Anderson has caught the attention of franchises belonging to MLC. As the league is expanding heavily, adding more international stars on board, Anderson is a great addition to such a roster.\n\nStill, Anderson’s Test record is nothing short of extraordinary. He assumes the impressive mantle of being England’s all-time leading wicket-taker in Tests with 704. He continues to adapt his bowling to varying conditions, which ensured that he was and still is given a very long run. But in the past year or so, Anderson has spoken more on test cricket than anything else, with his last game in T20 cricket going as far back as 2014.\n\nThe Ambitious Plans of MLC\n\nMajor League Cricket has been in the news for wanting world-class cricketers. Such big tickets have already attracted some star players to the league, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella-backed league, which has managed to attract notable cricketers like Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head. Anderson’s possible addition would further fill up the reputation of such a league.\n\nHe would be handsomely paid somewhere around Rs 1.49 crore (approximately 135,000 euros) for his tenure with the MLC. It is big money for franchises that shift their focus on experienced players who have the skills with star power. For him, it is a good chance to produce some virtues in another format of the game and his cricketing career.\n\nTen years may have elapsed since Anderson played T20 cricket, but he is not uncertain that he will play T20 cricket with a lot of success in this format. His last T20 game was for Lancashire in the T20 Blast back in 2014, but he maintains that his skills and experiences will be quite relevant to T20 cricket. This comes through the careful approach to bowling and fitness regimes.\n\nMLC Expansions and the Future\n\nFrom 19 games in the MLC, it has expanded to 34 games in the year 2025, giving ample testimony to how much the league has grown and aspires to be ambitious. Of course, it’s just the right opportunity for players like Anderson to feature meaningfully. A league that can have players like the current England international no doubt has the makings to be one of the giants in international cricket.\n\nA comeback to T20 would constitute an interesting chapter to the already illustrious career of Anderson. He could savor the challenge in a different format and also top up on his fame as one of the game’s greats. Being in the MLC will also inspire young cricketers and gain more attention for the league.\n\nA return for James Anderson in T20 cricket in the form of MLC would be something cricket fans would certainly welcome. Setting aside his focus on Test cricket, any possible involvement in the MLC is proof of his never-ending talent, and he can be versatile with the different roles that he will be called upon to perform. As the MLC grows, Anderson’s participation will be pivotal in further shaping its future and further cementing his place in cricketing history.\n\nFor More Great Content\n\nAre you desiring top-tier content that covers everything?

Ricky’s legendary status, characterized by his leadership, winning mindset, and commitment to nurturing talent, aligns perfectly with our goals.\n\n“His understanding of our vision—to enhance the sport’s profile in the US and to develop local talent—resonates with our mission.\n\n“Ricky’s appointment is a pivotal step in our quest to not just participate in the MLC but to redefine it, offering unparalleled cricket experiences to our fans and creating a legacy of excellence in American cricket.”",

    "title": "Australian players that Ricky Ponting could target at Punjab Kings",
    "date": "Wed Sep 18 14:02:22 2024",
    "body": "On September 18 (Wednesday), Punjab Kings announced that the 49-year-old Australian Ricky Ponting will replace fellow Australian Trevor Bayliss as their new head coach for the upcoming season.\n\nOne thing that Ponting’s tenure at Delhi Capitals resulted in was a large number of Australian cricketers in the squad. This was seen during the 2024 edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC), Washington Freedom, where he said as many as four Australian cricketers.\n\nIf the trend has to follow, these are the Australian players that Ponting could target for Punjab Kings at the 2025 IPL Auction.\n\nTim David\n\nPonting’s connection with the Hobart Hurricanes is quite strong, and hence, Tim David could very well be targeted by the Punjab Kings. David could fit into the Kings’ system like a glove, with his ability to clear the fence with ease.\n\n\"If I was a selector, I would love to have someone like that [David] in my team. He's the sort of player that could actually win you a World Cup,\" Ponting had praised David endlessly.\n\nWhile David’s numbers might be nosediving, you can be rest assured that someone like Ponting would be eyeing to resurrect his career.\n\nTravis Head\n\nWhile it might come in as unlikely news, there’s still a slim chance that SRH might retain Pat Cummins and Heinrich Klaasen ahead of Travis Head. That essentially gives the Kings an outside chance of snapping the all-rounder.\n\nAlso Read: Travis Head’s 2024: the best ever by an Aussie & among the greatest in T20I history\n\nHead has dominated 2024 like no one else has, and that could be enough for PBKS to go hard for the all-rounder. Consider this as well - it could even be a realistic possibility that PBKS could afford Head, considering how much money they would save out of retaining very few players.\n\nSteve Smith\n\nWhaattt? It is an all-time low even for Punjab Kings, you might wonder. But here’s the catch. The right-hander amassed 336 runs in just nine appearances for the Washington Freedom while scoring at a strike rate of 148.67.\n\nPrior to that, Smith also had a stellar 2022/23 season, during which he scored 346 runs with a strike rate of 174.74. Given his great captaincy options, Punjab Kings might definitely be interested in getting him on board.\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nThere’s a really good chance that RCB might let go of Glenn Maxwell, their favourite overseas child after AB de Villiers in recent years. Maxwell hasn’t been in the best of form, with 52 runs, averaging just 5.77!!!\n\nHe might have played for Punjab Kings before, but he could be a force if he reunites with Ponting, whom he coached at the Freedom setup.\n\nNikhil Chaudhary\n\nPunjab Kings and swashbuckling all-rounders? That’s a perfect match. That’s where Nikhil Chaudhary could come in handy for the Kings. The 28-year-old showed his prowess in his maiden Big Bash League season, where he struck at 142.59.\n\nAdd in the Punjab factor, indeed a homecoming could be around the corner for Nikhil, considering both the franchise and the Ponting factor.\n\nPatrick Dooley\n\nThe windmill - that’s what people in Australia call the left-arm wrist spinner Patrick Dooley.\n\nOver the last two years, he’s absolutely mesmerized every batter in the competition with his quirky action that has mimicked the Indian pacer, Jasprit Bumrah. The 27-year-old could be an X-factor option for Punjab Kings.\n\nThe left-arm spinner has already picked up 25 wickets, averaging 21.60, including a four-wicket haul. Given how much Ponting rates him, don’t be surprised if PBKS might pick Dooley.\n\nMitchell Marsh\n\nShocking, right? Delhi Capitals might not retain the Australian captain. That’s where Punjab Kings might swoop in and take away the all-rounder from beneath everyone’s noses at the IPL Auction.\n\n“Talking about (captaincy) he's [Marsh] a rookie, but captaincy sits well with him,\" Ponting told ICC. That’s where Punjab could benefit from having Marsh as a captain as well. They have to build a future, and it could start with getting the Australian captain on board.",

    "body": "Lance Morris was ruled out of Ashes 2023 due to a back injury. After his comeback, he last featured in the Australian squad for the ODI series against West Indies in February. The series marked his international debut and he also claimed wickets in the third match in Canberra. But a side strain amidst the series has kept him at bay.\n\nHe was to feature for the Seattle Orcas in Major League Cricket but the scans highlighted a hot spot in his back and he missed Australia’s ongoing white-ball tour to the United Kingdom. As the pacer is currently undergoing rehab, he admitted that the recuperation process has been \"frustrating\".\n\n\"It's been a bit frustrating. I guess you call it a stress fracture, but when we scan it, it doesn't have the natural characteristics of a usual stress fracture. So there was some confusion at first around exactly what it was,” said Morris as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.\n\nAlso Read: Nathan Ellis to miss Australia's UK tour with hamstring injury\n\n\"The tricky one for me was I didn't actually have any back pain when I was bowling. I get monthly check-ins with an MRI on my back to make sure things are heading in the right direction. And it's been clearing up... healing, so that's a positive,” he added.\n\nBut the silver lining is I've stayed fit: Lance Morris\n\nMorris grabbed the spotlight for his ability to bowl over 150 kmph.

He first came to prominence at the 2020 Under-19 World Cup, breaking the record for the most runs scored in a single edition of the competition. That performance earned him a deal at Mumbai Indians, rare for an overseas uncapped player, and he has since played for MI Cape Town and MI New York in the SA20 and Major League Cricket, as well as for St. Kitts and Nevis Patriots in the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nHis overall statistics are promising but not outstanding, with averages either side of 40 in first-class and List A cricket, and an average and strike rate just below 25 and 140 respectively in T20 cricket. He has already claimed one record, however, notching the highest T20 score by a South African in 2022’s CSA T20 Challenge. He also broke the world record for the fastest score of 150 in the format, bringing the milestone up in 52 balls.\n\nHe has found the South Africa side tough to break into, with the Proteas having qualified for the semi-finals of the last World Cup in each format, and reaching a maiden World Cup final earlier this year. His recent selection for South Africa A suggests he is still in the selectors’ thoughts, and he bolstered his claim with scores of 49 and 74 in second ‘Test’ against Sri Lanka A after taking 4-46 to secure a consolation one-day win between the sides.\n\nSpeaking to South Africa’s Sunday Times, Brevis explained how he wanted to be viewed as an all-rounder in all formats.\n\n“I want to get into all the Proteas squads, to be an all-format player. I want to be noticed as an all-rounder, not just a batter. I hope in the new season I really get more opportunities with the ball,” he said.\n\nHe also outlined his lofty personal ambitions. “It’s interesting … I’m never happy or satisfied with my performance, I feel that’s dangerous. When you think you’ve ‘made it’ or you’ve achieved something great, the game will bring you back down to earth very quickly. I’m always in competition with myself.

Shehan Jayasuriya (24 in 27 balls, with three fours and a six) joined Quinton de Kock (26 in 19 balls, with two fours and a six), and the pair took control of the run chase. At the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 47/1.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya eventually fell to Calvin Savage in the seventh over after a 27-ball stint at the crease. Not long after, the dangerous Quinton de Kock was also dismissed, leaving the Orcas at 59/3 in the ninth over.\n\nAlso Read: https://www.thehawk.in/posts/snoop-dogg-named-one-of-the-final-torchbearers-at-paris-olympics\n\nFaced with a steep equation, the onus was on Heinrich Klaasen (4) and Matthew Bracewell (4) to steer the innings. However, both batters were outfoxed by spinners and dismissed for single digits. Mitchell Santner saw the back of Klaasen, while Bracewell was trapped by Noor Ahmad.\n\nComing together with the score at 67/5 in 10.4 overs, Shubham Ranjane (16) and Keemo Paul (25 in 17 balls, with three fours) labored to keep the Orcas in contention. However, Ranjane was run out and Keemo Paul was castled by Noor Ahmad before the 17th over, comprehensively extinguishing the run chase. Ali Sheikh chipped in with a consolatory knock, but the Orcas fell well short, finishing at 140/9.Otneill Bartman took two wickets in the tail to finish with figures of 3/20.\n\nEarlier in the day. The Texas Super Kings lost openers Devon Conway (0) and Joshua Tromp (6) early in the innings, however, Faf Du Plessis (39 in 17 balls) was in fine form, smashing six boundaries and a six before he was scalped by Keemo Paul. At the end of the power play the Texas Super Kings were placed at 56/3.\n\nMilind Kumar (29 in 28 balls, with two sixes) played a watchful knock, scoring nearly a run-a-ball before he became Keemo Paul's second wicket of the day. The experienced all-rounders, Marcus Stoinis (11) and Mitchell Santner (15) both got starts, but failed to convert them into bigger scores, falling to Aryan Desai and Matthew Bracewell, respectively.\n\nCalvin Savage (45* in 27 balls, with six fours and two sixes) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson, the pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings. Stevenson (17) struck a four and six to support Savage's late innings fireworks, but was cleaned by Nandre Burger in the 18th overs.\n\nSavage hammered Bracewell for two consecutive maximums in the 16th over and went on to script a 17 run over of Nande Burger's 18th over to remain unbeaten and help the Texas Super Kings finish at 177/8.\n\nBrief Scores\n\nTexas Super Kings 177/8 (Faf Du Plessis 39 off 17, Colin Savage 45* off 27, Keemo Paul 2/18, Ayan Desai 2/30) beat Seattle Orcas 140/9 (Quinton de Kock 26 off 19, Keemo Paul 25 off 17, Ottneil Bartman 3/20, Noor Ahmad 2/19 ) by 37 runs.\n\n—ANI",

His retirement marked the end of an era in Test cricket, but the 42-year-old fast bowler might not be done with the sport just yet.\n\nAccording to a BBC Sport report, at least one MLC team has shown keen interest in Anderson following his optimism about a potential return to white-ball cricket.

Meanwhile, since his retirement, the pacer engaged himself in coaching the national team as England men's bowling consultant. He also extended his contract for the upcoming winter tours of Pakistan and New Zealand.\n\n\"At the minute, I'm due to go to Pakistan and New Zealand in the winter. Then nothing concrete after that.

    "body": "James Anderson, the top wicket-taker among Test cricket pacers with 704 wickets over nearly two decades, surpassed Glenn McGrath's record of 563 wickets in 2018. Renowned for his swing and accuracy, Anderson recently retired at age 41 and is considering playing franchise cricket, potentially Major League Cricket in the USA.\n\nJames Anderson (X Photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: James Anderson who is the leading wicket taker among the pacers in test cricket has scalped the wickets of batters for almost two decades. In his 35o innings of Test career, he has scalped 704 wicket to become the only pacer to take more than 700 wickets.\n\nPrior to this Australian great, Glenn Mcgrath was the leading wicket taker with 563 wickets but Anderson broke his record in 2018. Anderson who is the first bowler from England to cross 500 wickets mark, is precisely known for his swing and accuracy. With his swing, he has troubled even the greatest like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Virat Kohli. Even Shubman Gill, who is the upcoming star for India's batting order has also struggled against James Anderson.\n\nJames Anderson started his England one-day career in 2002-03 with just three one-day games for Lancashire under his belt. He stepped in as cover for Andy Caddick during the series in Australia. Despite not having a name or number on his shirt, Anderson impressed with a ten-over spell that allowed only 12 runs in the intense heat of Adelaide.\n\nThis performance earned him a spot in the World Cup squad, where he continued to shine by delivering a match winning spell against Pakistan. However, he faced a challenging moment in a last-over situation against Australia. Anderson's rapid rise in international cricket during this period marked the beginning of his notable career.\n\nJames Anderson, who recently retired at the age of 41, remains enthusiastic about cricket and is considering joining franchise cricket. Anderson might play in Major League Cricket in the USA, which includes notable players such as Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, and Nicholas Pooran.\n\nShaun Pollock, a South African pacer with 421 test wickets, once discussed what makes Anderson's bowling stand out.\n\nAccording to Pollock, other seamers would keep the seam of the ball straight, but James Anderson tried to create a slight wobble, leaving the batter clueless about what the ball would do once it pitched.\n\n\"A key factor is that the swing begins from 20 metres away. It starts to swing, and for the next 10 metres, you can see it moving through the air, whereas seam movement happens just 5 metres from the batter. Once the ball moves, the batter has no chance to react.\" Pollock continued.\n\nit's impossible to react when you are facing jimmy anderson\n\n\"You can see the guys (batter) trying to respond. With swing through the air, you can watch the ball and judge whether to leave it or if it's coming in, you must play it. But when the ball comes down straight and then moves off the pitch, what can you do? It's impossible to react,\" Pollock added.\n\nJames Anderson was close to reaching another significant milestone in Test cricket. He was just four wickets away from becoming the second-highest wicket-taker in Test matches. Currently, Anderson is contributing to England's cricket team as a bowling mentor during this Test summer.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "body": "Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting didn't take much time in deciding his next organisation in the IPL after parting ways with the Delhi Capitals following a seven-season stint from 2018 to 2024. Ponting has signed a four-year contract with the Punjab Kings, the longest in the franchise's history considering the 2014 finalists have had 10 coaches prior to the ex-Delhi Capitals head coach. Since Ponting is coming off winning the Major League Cricket (MLC) with the Washington Freedom, it will keep him in good stead given there's a mega auction coming up and it will give him a chance to start from scratch.\n\nPonting admitted that 'project Punjab' attracted him given there were a couple of more offers after he parted ways with the Capitals. \"Yes, I was talking to a few teams, but it was \"Project Punjab\" which attracted me. It is a team that hasn't had a lot of success over a long period of time, a team that's changed coaches a lot, so I saw it as a challenge,\" Ponting told ESPNCricinfo.\n\nPonting said that he was impressed with a few of the youngsters from the Punjab side last season and with a four-season deal he has with the Kings, he hopes to win a title, which he couldn't with the Capitals in seven years. Obviously that was one rationale why he wasn't retained as the coach as Capitals reached playoffs in three seasons out of seven including a final in 2020 but Ponting revealed it wasn't the only reason.\n\n\"One thing I have noticed a bit this year is, a lot of the IPL franchises, because they have so many teams now across most T20 leagues, they are looking to have almost full-time coaching staff, which was one of the things that was the undoing with me with DC,\" Ponting added. \"They wanted more time and to have an India-based coach on the ground there for most of the year. I couldn't commit to that. That's the way it seems that a lot of the teams are going and it makes perfect sense.\"\n\nPonting said that he was disappointed with the way his tenure with the Capitals ended as he was able to create a really good environment with the side. However, he couldn't commit to a full-time involvement, which is one of the reasons he hasn't taken up an international coaching job.",

    "body": "In a move that’s stirring the cricketing world, James Anderson, England’s legendary fast bowler, is reportedly in the sights of a Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise. At 42, with a career that has seen him amass 704 Test wickets, Anderson’s potential venture into the MLC could mark a significant chapter not just for him but for cricket’s expansion in the USA.\n\nA New Frontier for James Anderson:\n\nHaving retired from international cricket, Anderson’s interest in the MLC reflects his enduring passion for the game. The MLC, aiming to popularize cricket in America, represents an exciting new challenge for Anderson, who has primarily focused on Test cricket over the past decade.\n\nFinancial Incentive:\n\nThe offer of 1.49 crore INR for a short stint underscores the financial allure of franchise cricket. For Anderson, this could be more than just money; it’s a chance to engage with cricket in a new format and environment, potentially extending his playing career or transitioning into a coaching role.\n\nImpact on MLC:\n\nAnderson’s involvement would undoubtedly elevate the MLC’s profile. His experience and skill could mentor younger players, enhance team strategies, and attract more fans and investors to the league, accelerating its growth trajectory.\n\nStrategic Move for Cricket in the USA:\n\nThe MLC’s ambition to expand to ten teams by 2025 indicates a strategic push towards making cricket a mainstream sport in America. Anderson’s participation could be a catalyst in this mission, bringing his expertise in swing bowling to conditions that might favor such skills.\n\nFan and Cricket Community Reaction:\n\nThe news has sparked a mix of reactions. While many celebrate Anderson’s willingness to explore new avenues, there’s nostalgia about his Test cricket days. However, his move could inspire a new generation of cricketers in the USA, showing that cricket careers can have multiple phases.\n\nChallenges Ahead:\n\nAnderson’s last T20 match was over a decade ago, which might pose challenges in adapting to the fast-paced T20 format. However, his cricketing acumen and fitness could well see him thrive, especially with the shorter format’s emphasis on strategy and experience.\n\nA Broader Perspective:\n\nBeyond Anderson’s personal journey, this move highlights cricket’s global aspirations. The MLC, with its growing stature, could become a significant platform for cricketers worldwide, offering opportunities for those looking to extend or transition their careers.\n\nJames Anderson’s potential stint in the MLC isn’t just about playing cricket; it’s about contributing to the sport’s growth in new markets, mentoring, and perhaps, discovering new talents. As the cricketing world watches, Anderson’s decision could set a precedent for how retired or retiring stars engage with the game’s future.\n\nThis development in Anderson’s career, if realized, could be a testament to his love for cricket, his adaptability, and his role in shaping the sport’s future landscape. Whether for the money, the challenge, or the love of the game, Anderson’s potential move to the MLC is more than just a career choice; it’s a statement on cricket’s evolving narrative.",

    "body": "Like some of their famous Bay Area sports counterparts, San Francisco Unicorns might just have an edge in Major League Cricket through proximity and close links to Silicon Valley.\n\nAhead of the recent second season, where they finished runners-up, the Unicorns landed the biggest signature so far in the fledgling American T20 pro franchise league.\n\nForbesChicago And Atlanta Could Be The Next Franchises In Major League Cricket\n\nStar quick Pat Cummins, Australia's Test and World Cup winning captain, signed a four-year contract with the Unicorns in a major boost for the credibility of the lucrative six-team competition hoped to stir interest in cricket in the world's biggest sports market.\n\nIt was initially seen as a surprising move from the 31-year-old Cummins, who does not play much franchise cricket due to his enormous international workload. He only plays in the money-spinning Indian Premier League, where his recent deal was $2.4 million, and rarely suits up in Australia's Big Bash League because of cricket's increasingly congested calendar.\n\nLike many of his compatriots, Cummins was lured to MLC. Not necessarily for the money - although the MLC does offer healthy remuneration in line with rival T20 leagues - or playing amid the bright lights of the American sports scene. But rather for exploring business interests, with Cummins attracted to the Unicorns in a bid to get a foot into Silicon Valley.\n\nThe Unicorns are the latest partnership between co-owners Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan. They were founding partners of early ecommerce company Junglee, which was acquired by Amazon in 1998 for $250 million. They also later founded Kosmix, which was acquired by Walmart, and were early investors in Facebook.\n\nForbesWhy A Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist Decided To Invest In America’s New Pro Cricket League\n\n\"That (Silicon Valley) was the reason we were able to get him,\" Rajaraman told me. \"We are a start-up league. The attraction to him is that it is easier way for him to get connected into Silicon Valley.\n\n\"He's interested in technology and start-ups and so on. He's already an investor in start-ups and he wants to expand that and connect into Silicon Valley. We've facilitated that and it was our promise to him to make that happen.\"\n\nWith perfectly manicured hair, and thick glasses that makes him look like Clark Kent when he's not playing Superman on the field, Cummins has been divisive for some of his compatriots due to his advocacy for climate change, a stance that Australia's dominant right-winged Murdoch media pile into him creating a certain perception.\n\nUnlike the traditional hard-bitten, beer-swigging, Australian cricketer, Cummins represents a more cultivated modern player that has smashed to bits stereotypes. Cummins took just four wickets from six MLC matches, but saved his best performance for the final when he dismissed compatriots Travis Head and Steve Smith.\n\n\"He's a fantastic guy, amazing human and very, very, very sharp,\" Ramarajan said of Cummins. \"So happy that we had him on the team and so happy that I got to spend some time with him.\n\n\"He's one of those guys, who just by his presence elevates the whole atmosphere of the team and it just lifts everyone.\"\n\nCummins' off-field attraction to the Bay Area is reminiscent of NBA superstar Kevin Durant's famous move to the Golden State Warriors in 2016.\n\nThe Unicorns have wisely decided to embrace Silicon Valley as an identity. Not just as a means of luring those wanting to expand their financial acumen, but also in the franchise's approach to analytics and AI to evaluate T20 cricket.\n\nForbesSan Francisco Unicorns Embracing Silicon Valley Identity As Major League Cricket Takes Off\n\n\"Silicon Valley is our brand,\" Ramarajan said. \"We used data and analytics quite significantly. We've been trying to push the envelope. Some of the success we had in assembling the team and decisions we made were backed by new data driven methods that we've been developing.\n\n\"That's all part of our Silicon Valley brand.\"",

    "date": "Tue May 28 19:46:00 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC), the burgeoning T20 tournament in the USA, has achieved a significant milestone by acquiring List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) just before its second season. This achievement places MLC as the second Associate-run franchise competition to receive List A status, following the UAE's ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThe elevation to List A status signifies a formal recognition of MLC as an official T20 league, with all tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics. Justin Geale, the tournament director, expressed enthusiasm about this development, highlighting the recognition of the tournament's high standards and the quality of players involved. He mentioned that this recognition would enhance the credibility of cricket in the USA on a global scale.\n\nGeale thanked the ICC for acknowledging MLC's unique position as an Associate nation, emphasizing the tournament's role in providing a platform for some of the world's best players to showcase their skills alongside their peers.\n\nMLC's 2024 edition is set to commence on July 5, immediately following the conclusion of the T20 World Cup on June 29 in Bridgetown. This timing marks a crucial period for cricket's efforts to establish a strong presence in the US market.\n\nIn addition to the List A status, MLC has unveiled plans for expansion, aiming to grow from six teams to 10 over the next few years. The number of games is also set to increase, from 19 in 2023 to 34 by 2025, with 25 games scheduled for the upcoming season.\n\nVijay Srinivasan, MLC's chief executive, outlined the league's vision for expansion and scheduling adjustments to avoid clashes with other prominent cricket events. He discussed plans to start the league earlier in June to coincide with the school holidays in the US, providing a favorable window for MLC's growth.\n\n\"It was always intended to be a 10-team league,\" MLC's chief executive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the Guardian. \"Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that's our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.\"\n\n\"Ultimately for us, our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,\" Srinivasan said. \"With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That's how we would like to establish our window.\"\n\nLast year, the MLC concluded just two days before the start of the Hundred. However, this time there will be a six-day overlap between the two leagues, with the MLC ending on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. Consequently, up to half of the overseas players in the Hundred may arrive in the UK late after the MLC ends. Twelve out of the 24 overseas players contracted in the men's Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in the MLC, and more may follow before the tournament begins.\n\nFour out of the six teams in the MLC are owned by IPL team owners: Mumbai Indians, KKR, Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals.",

    "body": "On the face of it, this should be a World Cup that suits South Asian teams. Pitches in the Caribbean have tended to be slow, in Guyana, Kingstown, and Antigua in particular.\n\nIf the trends seen in last year's Major League Cricket are any indication, surfaces in Dallas are likely to tend towards the slower side also. And in Lauderhill, Florida, only once has a team breached 190 in the six men's T20 Internationals played there this decade.\n\nBut this is a World Cup in which so little can be confidently predicted. So, few matches have been played in the three United States venues. Although drop-in pitches are being imported, and technically should play fairly evenly, there is no real telling how those tracks will fare in the particular climatic conditions that prevail in each of these venues, or how they will wear through the course of the tournament. New York is an especially tricky proposition. One month out, the stadium there is still being constructed.\n\nWith so much uncertainty about how the tournament will pan out, it could be the all-rounders in each squad that define teams' progress.\n\nWhen a side turns up at the ground and the track looks like there will be some seam early on [particularly in the morning matches, some of which start as early as 10:30am local time], captains would ideally like to have a high-quality seam-bowling all-rounder to boost the fast-bowling stocks, while compromising little in the way of batting.\n\nIf, mid-tournament, the pitches begin to change after several matches have been played on the same square, teams with spin-bowling all-rounders may find themselves in advantageous positions, in terms of picking their XI.\n\nMost South Asian sides have the spin-bowling all-rounder spot covered, of course. Bangladesh have Shakib Al Hasan, India have Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, Sri Lanka have Wanindu Hasaranga, Afghanistan have Rashid Khan, and Pakistan have Shadab Khan. So good is South Asia at producing spin bowlers that can bat, that all these players would likely make it into the team based only on their bowling.\n\nBut when it comes to seam-bowling all-rounders, South Asian sides tend not to have as high-quality a production line. Sri Lanka, for example, have Dasun Shanaka and Angelo Mathews in their squad. Both are batting all-rounders, and limited bowlers -- Mathews can be effective with the new ball when there is seam and swing on offer, but struggles in the middle overs, and cannot really bowl at the death except in extreme circumstances. Shanaka prefers bowling a quiet over in the middle, but has been in poor hitting form over the past year.\n\nIndia have Hardik Pandya, but he's coming off a rough IPL season, when for the first time in his career, he has faced the ire of India fans. Shivam Dube is also in the India squad, but at the international level, his bowling returns don't inspire a lot of confidence.\n\nPakistan are unlikely to pick any seam-bowling all-rounders. Afghanistan have the likes of Gulbadin Naib and Karim Janat. Again, these are players with only passable bowling statistics. Unlike the spinners, many of South Asia's seam-bowling all-rounders would not make the XI on one skill alone.\n\nUnusually for a World Cup year, there has also not been an Asia Cup. This year the IPL has imposed itself in the months leading up to the global tournament. Many have noted that the Impact Player rule in the IPL has seriously disadvantaged all-rounders. How India pivots back to a competition in which they cannot call on ultra-specialists to take care of specific passages in the game, remains to be seen.\n\nThe counter to this, of course, is that South Asia perhaps has the finest seam bowling cohort it has ever sent to a World Cup. Bangladesh have Mustafizur Rehman and Taskin Ahmed. Pakistan have Naseem Shah and Shaheen Afridi. Sri Lanka have their fastest seam-bowling battery ever -- Dushmantha Chameera, Dilshan Madushanka and Matheesha Pathirana all capable of breaching 145kph. India, of course, have the most valuable quick of them all, Jasprit Bumrah, as well as Mohammad Siraj, who is likely to prosper when movement is on offer.\n\nBut at a tournament that involves so much travel between time zones, such a diversity of venues, and a huge variety of teams, versatility is likely to be key. How well can you fine-tune your strategy for this particular match? All-rounders may be key to that.\n\nAndrew Fidel Fernando is a senior writer at ESPNcricinfo.",

    "date": "Mon May 27 13:01:00 2024",
    "body": "Synopsis\n\nCricket returns to North America through the T20 World Cup, aiming to capture local interest despite limited awareness. With 30 million U.S. fans, the ICC sees potential. The event sets the stage for cricket's 2028 Olympic comeback. Major League Cricket's launch and strategic marketing aim to expand the sport's U.S. presence.\n\nCricket, a popular pastime in the United States in the mid 1800s, makes a big-ticket return to North American shores through the T20 Word Cup but will it be able to leave an impression on the local audience that knows little to nothing about the gentleman's game? Cricket globally is driven by India but the International Cricket Council sees huge potential in the American market and claims there are already 30 million fans that follow the game in the massive country.\n\nThe T20 showpiece is also seen as a major stepping stone to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make a comeback after 128 years when the big event kicks off on June 1.\n\nA total of 16 games will be played across three venues -- New York, Dallas and Lauderhill -- with a majority of 55 matches scheduled in the Caribbean including the knock-outs.\n\nDay three of the competition will have South Africa and Sri Lanka battling it out in New York, where the first ever international cricket game was held between USA and Canada back in 1844.\n\nIt was a phase when the sport was played widely across America before a much faster alternative in Baseball gained prominence during the Civil War in the 1860s.\n\n\"...(T20) it's entertainment and that's what people look for. That's what Americans look for, you know, they want entertainment,\" says legendary West Indian Brian Lara, one of the most recognisable cricketers in the world but someone who admits that he could walk around Miami without getting a second look.\n\n\"You know, you speak to an American and I've done that many times and they'd say 'you play a game for five days and then you end up in a draw? What's that all about?' So it's, it is difficult,\" he explains the challenge of selling Test cricket to an American, who might just warm up to the shortest format though.\n\nA couple of weeks of international cricket in an alien land will not be enough to evoke long-lasting interest from the local audience and to ensure the game grows beyond the South Asian and Caribbean expat community, the stakeholders will need more time.\n\nFor a beginner, cricket can be rather complex to understand especially when one is introduced to \"third man\", \"fine leg\" or \"deep mid-wicket\", some of the terms used for the many field placements in the game.\n\nThe ICC is pulling out all stops to engage with the American audience, whether it is getting eight-time Olympic gold-winning sprinter Usain Bolt on board as the World Cup ambassador or promoting the event at the recent Formula 1 race in Miami.\n\nTo distract the average American household from the world of baseball, NFL and NBA, cricket will need to grow at the grassroots level.\n\n\"I surely think the game can grow in the USA. When you have presence in a country people start gravitating towards it and want to know more about,\" Bolt, who belongs to the cricket-loving Caribbean, told PTI in a recent interview.\n\nThe Americans have surely one reason to follow the event. Their team, mainly made up of players from South Asian and Caribbean heritage, will be making its World Cup debut.\n\nVenu Pisike, head of USA Cricket, reckons the ICC event will bring much-needed awareness around the game but eventually, it is the lure of taking part in the 2028 Olympics that will draw masses to the sport.\n\n\"So far, cricket is predominantly an expats' game, but with the marketing and promotion activities during the World Cup, there is some momentum and the World Cup will definitely boost the opportunities to expand the game in the USA,\" said Pisike.\n\n\"Definitely, the World Cup is bringing a lot of awareness and then the opportunity for cricket to be in the Olympics, that will definitely attract the community because the US is a huge sports country.\n\n\"Olympics is the prime area where all the sports bodies are focusing on since cricket is going to Olympics, that will actually give more opportunities to expand the sport between the World Cup and the Olympics,\" added Pisike.\n\nThe USA squad picked for the tournament makes up for a bunch of semi-professionals who rely on full-time jobs to run their families. That will have to change if the sport is to appeal to a broader audience in America, believes India-born USA squad member Nisarg Patel.\n\n\"Ultimately what needs to change in the USA is that an American kid in a high school needs to see a future in the game.

    "title": "Report: ICC Grants List A Status to Major League Cricket",
    "date": "Tue May 28 15:00:44 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket Gains List A Status from ICC\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) in the United States has taken a significant step forward by acquiring List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) ahead of its second season. This recognition places MLC alongside other official T20 leagues, affirming the quality and competitiveness of the tournament.\n\nEnhancing the Credibility of American Cricket\n\nJustin Geale, the tournament director, expressed his excitement about this development, noting that it acknowledges the high standard of players participating in the league. “By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale,” Geale told ESPNcricinfo.\n\nGeale emphasised the importance of this status for the players’ career statistics, ensuring their performances are officially recorded. This milestone is crucial for cricket’s growth in the US, an Associate nation with a unique opportunity to build a robust cricketing culture. Geale added, “It’s our hope that on the back of the upcoming World Cup and a successful season we can continue to build a platform for the sport to grow and ultimately succeed in the USA.”\n\nUpcoming Season and Expansion Plans\n\nThe 2024 edition of MLC is scheduled to begin on July 5, shortly after the T20 World Cup concludes on June 29 in Bridgetown. The T20 World Cup itself starts in Dallas, USA, on June 1, marking a pivotal season in efforts to popularise cricket in the US market.\n\nMLC’s plans for expansion are ambitious, with a vision to grow from the current six teams to 10 over the next few years. The number of games will also increase significantly, jumping from 19 matches in 2023 to 34 by 2025. Vijay Srinivasan, MLC’s chief executive, outlined this growth strategy to The Guardian, stating, “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan.”\n\nScheduling and Global Cricket Calendar\n\nThe league’s scheduling is strategic, aiming to find an optimal window in the crowded global cricket calendar. Srinivasan explained that the ideal start would be in early June, aligning with the end of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the start of school holidays in the US. This timing would avoid clashes with other major leagues like the Hundred and the T20 Blast.\n\nThis year, MLC will overlap with the Hundred by six days, with MLC concluding on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. This overlap means that several overseas players contracted to the Hundred might join their teams late. Currently, 12 out of the 24 overseas players in the Hundred have commitments in MLC, indicating a significant crossover of talent.\n\nOwnership and Infrastructure\n\nFour of the six teams in MLC are owned by IPL franchises – Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals. This association with established IPL teams has helped MLC attract high-calibre players and gain credibility.\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC ran from July 13 to 31, featuring 15 group-stage matches followed by four playoff games. MI New York emerged victorious, led by captain Nicholas Pooran. The second season will be hosted at the same venues as the first: Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.\n\nFuture Prospects for MLC\n\nThe official List A status and the planned expansion underscore the growing importance of MLC in the global cricket landscape. The league’s success could play a pivotal role in embedding cricket into the American sporting culture. With strategic planning and support from major cricketing bodies and franchises, MLC has the potential to become a significant player on the international stage.\n\nAs the league prepares for its second season, the anticipation is high. The players, teams, and fans are eager to see how MLC will continue to evolve and impact the sport globally. The future looks promising for Major League Cricket, and its journey will be closely watched by cricket enthusiasts around the world.",

    "body": "In a major boost to America’s premier T20 tournament, Major League Cricket has officially been given the List A status by the International Cricket Council. Started in June last year MLC has played a vital role in promoting the game of cricket in the United States which is evident by the fact that the tournament was able to grasp the attention of the audience in a country like India which is said to have one of the biggest consumer base of cricket in the world. Despite the odd time at which the matches were being televised and streamed the T20 league was watched by the cricket-loving nation.\n\nWhat They Said?\n\nIn the words of tournament director Justin Geale “By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Success\n\nAnother reason for the tournament’ssuccess was the involvement of big players gelled with talented local players like USA’s national team captain Monak Patel, and Aaron Jones former Indian all-rounder Harmeet Singh to name some. If we talk about experienced players it includes the likes of Kieron Pollard, Sunil Narine, and Andre Russell all of whom have made a name for themselves in T20 leagues around the world.\n\nAlso Read: Star Batters Quinton De Kock And Heinrich Klaasen Stay With Seattle Orcas For MLC 2024\n\nThe Impact\n\nThe MLC has made a huge impact on the performance of the national team as well which was on show during USA’s first-ever series win against a Test-playing nation as the Monak Patel-led side beat Bangladesh by the margin of 2-1 in the three-match T20 series. This was USA’s second series win on the trott having defeated Canada 4-0 in the previous series.\n\nAlso Read: MLC Franchises Pick One Domestic Player Each Through A Wildcard Draft\n\nThe Start\n\nThe second season of the Major League Cricket will begin from July 5 2024 which is a few days after the conclusion of the 2024 T20 World Cup scheduled to be held in the West Indies and USA from June 1 to June 30 a tournament which can be a stepping stone in ICC’s bid to promote cricket in the US as it is one of the biggest market after India as far as the value of the media broadcasting rights are concerned. USA will kick off their T20 World Cup campaign with the opening match of the tournament against Canada on June 1.\n\nThe Timing\n\nOne of the reasons why the league is starting in early July is to avoid the clash with England’s new competition The Hunfred. If we talk about last year’s scenario in 2023 the league ended just two days prior to the start of the Hundred which resulted in a jam-packed schedule for the players that participated in both leagues as they had to travel from one continent to another in a short span of time.",

    "date": "Mon May  6 12:20:17 2024",
    "body": "The 2024 Cricket World Cup is a big step toward popularizing the sport in America.\n\nI believe an exciting future awaits cricket in America, and it won’t be long before we see results. The International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup begins on June 1, and the competition will span the entire month. The U.S. is not only one of 20 countries participating; the U.S. is also co-hosting the tournament with Caribbean countries.\n\nTo make things even more exciting, America’s first game–against Canada on June 1–will be played on home soil at Grand Prarie Cricket Stadium in Dallas, TX.\n\nTournament games will also be played on Long Island, in Florida, and in various locations in the West Indies, with the final match on June 29 in Barbados.\n\nLearn more about the 2024 tournament here. You can watch tournament action on Willow TV.\n\nI have no doubt that co-hosting and playing cricket here will boost domestic interest in the game. When India hosted the 2023 World Cup, the ICC reported that it recorded over a trillion viewing minutes. While India has a significant headstart on cricket interest, there’s no doubt that the World Cup will draw new U.S.-based fans to the game.\n\nBut the rise of interest in America was a long time coming. Cricket was introduced in the 18th century through British colonization, and the U.S. played its first international cricket match in 1844 against Canada at St. George’s, New York. While there’s no question that cricket’s popularity lags behind America’s big four sports–football, baseball, basketball, and ice hockey–the sport is more popular here than many people think.\n\nRecently, the U.S. kicked off Major League Cricket (MLC), and the response has been encouraging. More than 77,000 people attended the inaugural season of the MLC and bought in around $2.8 million in ticket sales revenue. MLC also reported that this league reached audiences of all levels, generating 110 million+ social media impressions and around 9 million engagements/15 million match views worldwide on YouTube.\n\nThere’s more, too. In addition to co-hosting the Cricket World Cup this year, the U.S. will also be home base to cricket’s return to the Summer Olympics after a 128-year absence. That will happen in 2028 at the Los Angeles games.\n\nSo, there are good reasons to be optimistic about cricket’s popularity here. But “likely” and “possible” popularity needs to be translated into tickets sold, customers in seats, and fans viewing the games on various platforms. Will it happen? I believe that the 2024 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics will go a long way toward popularizing the game in America, including motivating young people to play.",

    "date": "Thu May  2 08:37:39 2024",
    "body": "We were worried that during Season 1, people wouldn’t come. Obviously, we have a very big fanbase existing in the U.S.A., first generation, second generation, Indians, Australians, West Indians. And I was also looking to bring in new people, but the advantage is we already have that existing fanbase.\n\nSo, to see a full house and people waving their flags and chanting, I think it blew us away. I was also happy to see new people. I thought this was a party and what a mashup this is; this is great.\n\nWhat were some challenges and opportunities encountered during this edition of MCL?\n\nJustin Geale: I think our challenge moving forward is to be proud of our association with India but also Americanize the game a bit to bring in new people, so we are going to have samosas and also, we are going to have hot dogs.\n\nIt’s about how we blend these worlds together. It’s a unique challenge we have compared to the rest of the world, but the commercial opportunity involved here is massive. And obviously, the recognition of the brands Texas Super Kings, MRD York, Los Angeles Knight Riders, you have to see the advantage because it’s a novel factor, so our challenge is also to share that with America.\n\nWe are really pleasantly surprised; we have a lot more work to do, and let’s not kid ourselves. But sponsors like Royal and Cognizant are a huge part of that because they allow us to get that credibility; they are established brands and they can fast track the league.\n\nComing to you Abhinav, tell us about your experience of the first season and first-time partnership with Major League Cricket last year?\n\nAbhinav Arora: Being an official sponsor of the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) season was a true honor for Royal. We’re excited to extend our partnership into its second year, connecting cricket fans in the United States to South Asia’s rich culture and unique cuisines.\n\n…And what are your goals for the upcoming season?\n\nAbhinav Arora: As we begin this new season, our goal is to expand on last year’s success by enhancing the cricketing experience. During the inaugural season, Royal had unveiled its new ad spot, showcasing how Royal brings authentic taste that complements the thrill of every cricket game and celebrates the many flavors of cricket and the many flavors it brings out in fans.\n\nThe one-minute ad showcased the fusion of tradition, cuisine, and cricket, emphasizing the diverse traditions and flavors that make cricket an essential component of South Asian culture.\n\nThe great comments from spectators who appreciated our Sampling done at the cricket ground, Royal® basmati rice with numerous toppings, reinforces the relationship between Royal and MLC supporters. Fans at the stadium were treated to a complimentary ‘Build Your Own Bowl’ game day snack.\n\nWe’re eager to introduce cricket fans to new innovations and our refreshed brand identity this year, continuing to elevate their experience both on and off the field.\n\nJustin, which are the brands that have partnered with Major League Cricket for this edition?\n\nJustin Geale: This year, we’ve already secured Cognizant as our title sponsor, and we’re fortunate to have Royal returning from last year. They understand the landscape, the market’s scope, having been involved before us. Utilizing their expertise is crucial for us.\n\nWe’ve secured stake from another sponsor this year, meaning we now have three sponsors with significant experience, both nationally and internationally. This adds to our credibility because they have confidence in the market and the process. It’s truly a partnership, and given the risks involved, their trust is invaluable.\n\nFor years, we’ve pondered what strategies will succeed, and it’s challenging to prove that. These sponsors showed courage by being among the first to join us, and we greatly appreciate their support and the close relationship we’ve built with them.\n\nAbhinav, tell us about the what are the opportunities this partnership presents for Royal LT Foods Americas?\n\nAbhinav Arora: At LT Foods, we are overjoyed to have reached a significant milestone in our collaboration with MLC. During the first season in the United States, they played an important role in promoting cricket culture. The combination of South Asian cuisine and this exciting sport has really lit up the atmosphere.\n\nWith Royal’s ongoing support in Season 2, we’re preparing to reach even more people and strengthen our position as North America’s go-to brand for Basmati rice and Sona Masoori rice. We’re excited to broaden our reach like never before by collaborating with Royal’s die-hard fans and cricket fanatics.\n\nWe’re delighted to showcase our new brand logo and packaging to a varied audience of sports fans in the North American market as part of our continued relationship with MLC, which will open opportunities for growth and brand recognition.\n\nSpeaking of synergies, what kind of activations or marketing initiatives can we expect to see from Royal (LT America Foods) during the tournament?\n\nAbhinav Arora: Right from the opening night, fans can immerse themselves in giveaways, contests, and the electric atmosphere of Major League Cricket matches.\n\nWhat makes this season truly special is the opportunity for fans to experience the authentic flavors of South Asia while watching spectacular matches. This blend of exciting games and Royal’s delectable cuisine provides fans with a true sense of South Asia.\n\nAt Royal, our aim is to create unforgettable moments both on and off the field, enhancing our visibility and appeal to a wide audience of food and sports enthusiasts.\n\nOur sponsorship of the MLC’s top run scorer title is a testament to our commitment to supporting cricket at its highest level. The already thrilling season is about to get even more exciting as the top hitters in the world compete for this coveted prize!\n\nWe share the values of quality, history, and community that cricket and Royal represent. We hope that by hosting this event and collaborating in general, we can naturally integrate our brand into the cricketing community.\n\nHow is Major League Cricket tackling the challenge of introducing cricket as a new sport category in a country where it isn’t prevalent?\n\nJustin Geale: I think there’s an awareness of it, but it’s like that game that goes for five days, and like, no, this (MCL) is T20, it lasts for three hours.\n\nThe most comparable thing we have is baseball, I guess. That’s a bat and ball sport. And I love baseball too, not as much as cricket, but it’s quite slow. I mean, the game goes on for three hours, and it might end 3-1. You might see one or two home runs.\n\nSo we’re playing in a field that’s 400 meters wide. There might be 40 home runs, so there might be that many Sixers. There are no foul balls. You can hit the ball 360, and every ball is an event.\n\nHow are you maximizing the partnerships with teams such as the Super Kings, LA Knight Riders, and MI? What key elements have motivated the collaboration between these franchises, particularly highlighting the market expansion, continuous engagement throughout the year, and commercial prospects in the USA?\n\nJustin Geale: It’s a learning experience for everyone involved. I believe these franchises have joined because they recognize the market’s growth. Cricket is divided into various formats like SAT 20 and IT 20, each with its own team brands. This arrangement allows for year-round engagement.\n\nThere are significant commercial opportunities, especially when considering the synergies involved. For instance, LA Knight Righters could facilitate connections between Bollywood and Hollywood, envision Shahrukh Khan’s involvement. New York’s influence in finance offers additional advantages.\n\nThis expansion provides sponsors with enhanced exposure in a large and lucrative market. While I have an appreciation for Australia and the UK, the scale of the USA’s market and its embrace of capitalism offer unparalleled potential. Overall, this venture enables brands to tap into new audiences and opportunities.\n\nWhy should brands partner with MLC? What’s in it for them?\n\nJustin Geale: I believe the time is ripe for cricket in the USA. We’ve made significant progress in the past 25 years, and the upcoming India-Pakistan game will garner global attention. With cricket entering the Olympics in 2028, there are immense opportunities for growth, including government funding and increased competitiveness. Infrastructure development is underway, and hosting international matches will boost commercial prospects.\n\nI think one of the strongest things we can do is to build awareness and recognition for brands, to get consideration, to convert these consumers. So, we’re giving exposure because we’re only going with a very small number of sponsors.\n\nWe’re placing a strong emphasis on quality. It’s not merely about displaying a logo; it’s about implementing effective activation strategies. This includes sampling and delving into the brand’s narrative and heritage. Given their extensive presence, not just in India but also in America, we’re seriously considering their longstanding experience.\n\nSponsoring cricket in the USA targets affluent demographics, influencing policy and creating new market opportunities. This shift from niche to mainstream appeal presents sponsors with a unique chance to capitalize on a growing fanbase.\n\nHow is Royal leveraging digital and social media through the cricket league to reach wider audiences?\n\nAbhinav Arora: We’ll use social media to communicate with cricket fans, publishing engaging and entertaining content that integrates our brand message with their enthusiasm for the game.\n\nWe had seen good engagement around Season 1 content like ‘A very Royal XI’ contest where fans could build their own team and win MLC tickets and a signed cricket ball by players, thrilling ‘Choose Your Bowler Bracket,’ which engaged fans by inviting them to cast their votes for their favorite cricket players and meals.\n\nWe are committed to building strong relationships with cricket fans through our recipes, behind-the-scenes glimpses at cricket events, and engaging competitions.\n\nFinally, we want to be more than just a rice brand.\n\nHow do you plan to optimize distribution channels to ensure that your content reaches key markets effectively, considering both traditional television networks and digital platforms?\n\nJustin Geale: That’s an excellent question, and it’s a challenging one indeed due to the time zone misalignment, which we’re acutely aware of. However, our franchises are deeply committed to the American market.\n\nIn terms of the American market, Willow TV holds significant importance for us. We’re actively engaging with numerous RSNs, which encompass regional sports networks hosting events such as the NFL and MLB, along with local teams.\n\nFor instance, in my location in Chicago, RSNs are pivotal for accessing sports content. Similarly, in key markets like New York, Seattle, and LA, we’re striving to establish our presence.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the importance of traditional television platforms in reaching wider audiences, we recognize that digital platforms hold immense growth potential. Drawing insights from the growth observed in India with events like the IPL and World Cups, we believe digital platforms offer significant opportunities for engaging with Indian audiences.\n\nOur focus extends beyond the core action of the game; it encompasses the surrounding content such as morning highlights packages and other supplementary materials. This comprehensive approach enables us to effectively leverage and package sponsorship opportunities.\n\nHow do these collaborations fit into the broader landscape of sports sponsorship?\n\nJustin Geale: We do aim to bring about some disruption in cricket. As a startup based in Silicon Valley ourselves, we recognize the business potential of these already massive Indian brands. The question becomes: how do we consolidate these brands and leverage their power effectively?\n\nCollaboration is key. Building a successful league is not just beneficial for the teams involved but also for our sponsors. Ultimately, the success of the league hinges on the quality of cricket. It cannot be mere gimmickry. That’s why we prioritize having top-notch pitches and recruiting the best players globally, aside from Indian players.\n\nThis year, our lineup is exceptionally strong, allowing us to showcase cricket at its finest. This commitment to excellence ensures that newcomers perceive the sport as serious.\n\nHow will the ICC T20 World Cup being hosted in the USA boost cricket in the country?\n\nJustin Geale: We must capitalize on this opportunity by catering to our existing cricket fans while also making the sport more accessible to newcomers, thus expanding its appeal to everyone. This strategic approach is essential because both the ICC and other nations recognize the potential of cricket in the USA, evident in the expedited hosting of the World Cup.\n\nHow will MLC’s efforts to promote and propagate cricket in America contribute to local infrastructure and development needs, such as enhancing facilities and providing training at school and high school levels?\n\nJustin Geale: You’ve hit the nail on the head with that observation. Schools play a pivotal role here. When you examine the sports infrastructure in American colleges and high schools, it’s truly astounding. Our long-term strategy involves integrating cricket more extensively into the sporting landscape, thereby creating opportunities for scholarships.\n\nCurrently, aspiring athletes are more inclined towards sports like golf, tennis, or baseball, as they offer pathways to scholarships and eventual professional careers. However, as we continue to expand the game, particularly through initiatives like MLC, we’re providing a viable career option in cricket.\n\nThere’s tremendous potential for women’s cricket in this regard. If we consider sports like softball, which boasts exceptional hand-eye coordination skills, there’s a missed opportunity post-college as there’s no professional league. By introducing cricket early on, we offer an alternative career path. Imagine the prospects of traveling the world and playing in franchise cricket leagues.",

    "body": "Jason Roy has given up his England contract in order to play in this summer’s first edition of Major League Cricket.\n\nRoy made a request to the ECB to be released to play in the US franchise tournament, which England have granted on the condition that the World Cup-winning opener relinquish the remainder of his incremental deal.\n\nThe 32-year-old will not miss any England matches in order to play in the tournament, with Jos Buttler’s side not in white-ball action this summer until late-August, but under the terms of their contract the ECB could have asked him to rest during the gap between the Vitality Blast and Hundred. Roy’s decision will not effect his future selection prospects, with the batter still England’s incumbent opener in ODI cricket ahead of their World Cup defence in India this autumn.\n\nIn a statement, Roy insisted representing England remained his chief priority.\n\n“I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will ‘walk away from England’,” Roy said. “Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer. I hope to play for England for many more years.”\n\nRoy is set to become the first English player to sign up to the new competition, which takes place in Texas during the final two weeks of July, with reports suggesting he is likely to turn out for the LA Knight Riders, one of six newly-formed teams, four of which are at least partially backed by IPL owners.\n\nRoy has just returned from a stint with Kolkata Knight Riders at the IPL and is set to make his first Surrey appearance of the season in Thursday’s Blast opener against Middlesex at Lord’s.\n\nIt is understood that Roy will still be available for the entirety of Surrey’s Blast campaign, including Finals Day on July 15 should the county get that far, before flying to the US and then returning in time to play for Oval Invincibles in the Hundred.\n\nRoy was demoted to an incremental deal last October, having been dropped by England’s T20 side ahead of their successful World Cup campaign, and will now forgo the remainder of his salary up until the contract was due to expire at the end of September.\n\nIncremental contracts are worth between £60,000 and £70,000 a year and Roy could earn more than twice that amount for just two weeks’ work in the US.",

    "title": "Zampa admits not getting the same buzz from franchise cricket",
    "date": "Sun May 26 09:49:19 2024",
    "body": "Adam Zampa, the T20I and ODI World Cup-winning leg spinner, has admitted that he doesn’t get the “same buzz” as international cricket while practising his trade in franchise cricket.\n\nZampa was quite active in franchise cricket leagues in 2023; however, that was to get him fully prepared and in the groove for the ODI World Cup in India. Apart from playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Rajasthan Royals (he picked eight wickets in six games), Zampa also played in the Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States of America and the Hundred in England.\n\nZampa was due to return to the Royals camp in 2024 but withdrew from the competition to spend more time with his family at home. The leggie felt that doing so would also allow him to extend his career for Australia and play as long as he could.\n\n“There’s always a lot of chat about ‘can you play franchise cricket all year round’, and it was something I had thought about – at what age do I get through to try to play a bit of franchise cricket then,” Zampa told The Age.\n\n“But after 2023 and winning the World Cup and all that, and having a young family now as well, I’ve realised I want to play cricket for as long as I can, and instead of trying to play for nine or 10 months of the year, it’s played for six or seven.”\n\nZampa also admitted that the great environment provided by head coach Andrew McDonald and skipper Pat Cummins makes him enjoy his cricket. Moreover, his contract with Cricket Australia has allowed him the freedom to opt out of lucrative T20 league stints.\n\n“I’ve really come to love playing for Australia. I always loved it, but playing under Dan Vettori, Andrew McDonald and Pat and Mitch as captains, it is just so enjoyable. I make good money playing for Australia and I would love to prioritise playing for Australia and being with my family,” Zampa said.\n\n“I don’t get enough out of franchise cricket. It’s great for certain aspects of your life, and it can be really enjoyable, but it’s not like being in the Aussie dressing room, not for me anyway. I don’t get the same buzz out of it.”\n\nZampa also accepted that if he had played the IPL, he would have “dreaded” going to the World Cup because of the short turnaround time between the two tournaments. The three-month break before the World Cup has not only rejuvenated the leggie but also allowed him time to spend with his wife and kid.\n\n“The last three months have probably been the best three months of my life. I think if I’d gone to the IPL and I was home now for a few days I think I’d be really dreading going,” Zampa said honestly.\n\n“I haven’t had a break like this since my son was born, and that’s different to what I’ve had now. It gives me a bit of an idea of what life could look like after cricket, and it does excite me. But still a long way away, I think.”\n\nAustralia begin their World Cup journey against Oman on June 6.",

    "title": "The Major League Cricket for 2024 Season has a new powerful partner",
    "date": "Sun May 26 17:25:15 2024",
    "body": "On the 2nd of April, 2024, Cognizant Major League Cricket announced that they would be partnering with Stake.com for the MLC 2024 season.\n\nThe social casino, online gaming and sports betting brand is now the official sponsor for the American T20 League. They’ve signed a multi-year deal to support the MLC’s second season this summer.\n\nFor cricket fans in the United States and around the globe, this new strategic partnership is great news. With a strong financial backer supporting the league so early on in it’s history, there’s no doubt that the viewing experience for both casual fans and dedicated bettors will be greatly boosted.\n\nA summer of cricket with Stake.com\n\nWhen asked for comment on the partnership, Stake’s Chief Marketing Officer stated, “We thoroughly enjoyed MLC’s inaugural season in 2023 and jumped at the chance to become an Official Partner for 2024 and beyond. With the T20 World Cup taking place on US soil later in the year, we see this as a breakout year for cricket in the US and can’t wait to be a part of it.”\n\nThe partnership will allow Stake to be among the first betting platforms in line to connect with a passionate and rapidly growing American fanbase.\n\nAs for the fans, they can expect to see splashes of the brand’s logo throughout coverage for the season, which will officially begin on the 4th of July, just 4 days after the 2024 T20 World Cup wraps up. Along with prominent branding, fans may also look forward to participating in a number sponsored contests throughout the season.\n\nStake.com is also proud to be holding a prestigious honor this year at the league’s final. They are sponsoring the MVP of the Tournament award for the season’s top performing player. According to the official press release, this will add some needed recognition and weight to this already coveted award.\n\nLast year’s MVP winner was Nicholas Pooran due to his spectacular display of athleticism in last year’s explosive championship final. After South African cricketer Aiden Markram’s incredible catch earlier this year, it’s clear that 2024 is gearing up to be an exceptional year for cricket excellence, even more so now that Stake.com has entered the fold.\n\nWhat does this mean for bettors?\n\nThe partnership will likely be a cause for celebration among betting fans. The brand already has a great track record when it comes to growing and elevating sporting fan communities. MLC’s co-founder backs up this claim. In a statement, Srinivasan mentioned that he believes the partnership will bring the growth American cricket needs to flourish for many years to come.\n\nThe brains behind the MLC believe that, with Stake.com as a partner, the continued growth of the league is in good hands. In a statement, MLC’s co-founder Vijay Srinivasan said, “We’re excited to be partnering with a renowned company that supports many global sports properties.”\n\nIf fans of the MLC aren’t already familiar with Stake’s offering, now would be a great time to look into what the platform has in store for cricket and other sporting events this year. Not only is the platform highly regarded by seasoned bettors, newcomers can use the following promo code for Stake.com to effectively triple an initial deposit and get started placing wagers with the casino operator.\n\nWith the MLC tournament still a few weeks away, it will quickly become clear what other benefit Stake’s bettor’s can expect to see. Based on previous sponsorships, there’s a good chance bettors might see expanded betting options for MLC matches. There also might be other exclusive promotions on offer closer to the event.\n\nCasual fans might want to look into Stake’s platform too, even if betting isn’t their style. The site will no doubt offer some form of educational resources for people to learn more about the league and it’s players along with live statistic feeds for cricket fans who love to get stuck into extra facts and figures.\n\nThis isn’t Stake’s first rodeo\n\nWith the MLC partnership secured, Stake.com is expanding its already surprisingly extensive sports sponsorship portfolio. Most notably, the brand has previously become a title sponsor for a Formula One team and secured sponsorship deals with the UFC and Everton FC.\n\nThe brand has enjoyed a meteoric rise due, in part, by partnering with major sporting events. In just three short years, the previously unknown betting platform has processed an absolutely mind-blowing 45 billion sports gaming bets. The reasons behind this success has everything to do with Stake’s commitment to favorable odds, instant withdrawals and immensely thrilling promotions.\n\nThere’s little to no doubt that the timing of this MLC partnership is no accident. Stake.com appears to recognize the immense potential of American cricket, especially with the T20 World Cup also set to take place in the United States later this year. If cricket can become a major sport in the country with the same level of prestige as Major League Basketball or the NFL, this would open up a lucrative new betting market.\n\nWhen the season officially gets underway this July, there’s a good chance that the already exciting sport that is T20 Cricket will be even more action packed than ever. With Stake’s expertise guiding community building and facilitating safe and transparent betting, fans of all shapes and sizes will be in for a real cricket-themed treat.",

    "body": "Co-owned by Silicon Valley venture capitalists, San Francisco Unicorns have decided to embrace a specific identity as the franchise builds a brand in the fledgling Major League Cricket.\n\n\"The way we assembled the franchise...we want to be the Silicon Valley team. Silicon Valley is where start-ups are key,\" Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman told me in a phone interview. \"We want to identify young players who become icons. Our focus has been on finding superstars for the future.\n\n\"We wanted to use data and AI to inform and evaluate the sport.\"\n\nAnd which budding star did the cutting edge technology spit out? Jake Fraser-McGurk, the 22-year-old batting dynamo whose devastating power-hitting has lit up the ongoing Indian Premier League to such a degree that Australia's hierarchy were compelled to add him to their T20 World Cup squad as a reserve.\n\nThe Unicorns, who finished second from the bottom last year, quickly pounced and signed Fraser-McGurk for the upcoming season starting on July 5 in a somewhat reconnection with his former state Victoria, who have a high-performance partnership with the Unicorns.\n\n\"We've seen in the IPL that T20 is moving towards power striking and we're seeing huge totals scored, so we've gone for young players who can do that,\" Rajaraman said.\n\n\"We are trying something different with that start-up mindset. We've built a young list. We're hoping to start building tight affiliations with players, so fans can start seeing those connections.\"\n\nRajaraman and co-owner Venky Harinarayan understand the challenges that lie ahead for the Unicorns, with the novelty factor wearing off from the successful debut of MLC as cricket attempts to genuinely infiltrate the world's biggest sports market.\n\nAfter building the blocks in 2019, with investment topping $100 million, the well-heeled MLC's scheduled launch in 2021 then 2022 was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But its debut last season was nonetheless rushed leaving franchises scrambling to fill rosters.\n\n\"The decision to play the season was made just two months before the season. We didn't really have time to assemble a team,\" Harinarayan said. \"We just tried to put everything together and it was sort of a trial. It was a case of getting some players and see if this thing works.\n\n\"Even for a lot of the players it wasn't clear that this league was here to stay. The first season exceeded our expectations, but we start the second season with a little bit of nervousness because we have to sustain the momentum and then grow it.\"\n\nThe six-team MLC will expand by six games this season with teams to play seven matches in the group stages ahead of the four playoff games concluding with the final on July 28. As I reported recently, salary caps will not increase, but player wages will remain in the top echelons of T20 professional leagues.\n\nThere is an eventual goal that a home-and-away season - where teams play each other twice - will underpin MLC, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds with significant infrastructure required.\n\nLike last year the entire tournament will once again be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina. For the Unicorns, a stadium in San Jose in the works but still likely several years away.\n\n\"We are hampered until we actually play games at home. It's going to be a challenge for us to actually build real connectivity in the community,\" Harinarayan said. \"We want to first nail the South Asian community. The number two country in terms of new citizens in the U.S. was India after Mexico.\n\n\"At the same time we are very conscious that we want to make this experience, especially in the stadiums, really friendly to folks who are not South Asian.\n\n\"We saw last season that a fair number of locals, who weren't cricket fans, just showed up because it was on and they were surprised how much they enjoyed it.\"\n\nMLC starts less than a week after the T20 World Cup, which is partly hosted by the U.S. with group games in New York, Dallas and Lauderhill, Florida.\n\nWhile the build-up of the T20 World Cup has been completely overshadowed by the pointy end of the money-spinning IPL, there has been considerable attention on cricket's investment into the U.S.\n\nThe newly constructed ground in Long Island - costing around $30 million, as I reported recently - has grabbed much of the headlines and so too the exorbitant prices for resale tickets for the tournament's marquee game between rivals India and Pakistan in New York.\n\n\"Folks have commented how crazy the (India-Pakistan) prices are... they are even mind blowing for a Super Bowl,\" Rajaraman said. \"There's a lot of energy and excitement about that game and particularly India playing in the U.S.\n\n\"It's obviously phenomenal for cricket in America. Hopefully MLC gets a tailwind from it.\"\n\nThe Unicorns are the latest partnership between Rajaraman and Harinarayan. They were founding partners of early ecommerce company Junglee, which was acquired by Amazon Amazon in 1998 for $250 million. They also later founded Kosmix, which was acquired by Walmart Walmart , and were early investors in Facebook.\n\nThey've had an early win in their foray into sports with the Unicorns' distinctive name proving catchy among its fanbase after initial skepticism. \"You can either pick a safe name and just create an empty vessel or basically pick something which maybe not everybody likes,\" Harinarayan said.\n\n\"It got people riled up, but people really love it. There were fans wearing caps and attire and making their own interpretation of the name. The feedback has been extraordinarily positive.\"\n\nOwning a cricket team, the sport they are so passionate about, still feels slightly surreal for the India-born entrepreneurs.\n\n\"There's a bit of drudgery to be honest, but we really enjoy the cricket aspects,\" Rajaraman said. \"We want to get better as a franchise while also playing our part in making the league and U.S. cricket stronger.\n\n\"Just like from the start-up mindset, it sometimes takes a couple of iterations to get things right.\"",

The US had a taste of franchise cricket in 2023, with the resoundingly successful inaugural season of Major League Cricket, but international cricket history in North America goes back a long, long time. So far back, in fact, that the first ever international cricket match on record was played here, at the St George's Cricket Club ground in New York, between United States and Canada in 1844 (and Canada won).\n\nIn 1859, the US also hosted the first international cricket tour when an England XI travelled to the country - three years before the first England tour of Australia - to play five matches and three exhibition games against local cricketers, one of whom was later baseball pioneer Harry Wright.\n\nAn illustration of a match in progress in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851, between the New England and St George's cricket clubs © Corbis via Getty Images\n\nCricket's popularity dwindled after the American Civil War, as baseball's began to grow, but clubs across US and Canada continued to play each other intermittently well into the 20th century.\n\nMembers of the Winnipeg Junior Cricket Club play a game in Lincoln Park in Chicago in 1935 © Getty Images\n\nPhiladelphia and Pennsylvania remained thriving hubs of cricket in America where matches still drew sizeable crowds.\n\nImpeccably turned out spectators at a game at Merion Cricket Club in Haverford, Pennsylvania in 1938 © Getty Images\n\nBy the mid- to late 20th century, cricket was reduced to being largely a novelty sport, though expats would often hold exhibition games, as Eddie Phillips, a cricketer from Brighton in England did on his holiday in St Louis.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe the pitches in New Orleans.

    "title": "Canada’s Debut At T20 World Cup Drives Cricket Growth In North America",
    "date": "Tue May 21 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "The Cricket T20 World Cup is approaching fast. Anticipation for the first match between the co-hosts, the United States and their North American neighbors Canada on June 1 is gaining momentum. The game will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium, the former home of the Texas AirHogs and venue of the first Major League Cricket season last year.\n\nWhile much focus is on whether the home nation can compete with the giants of their group, India and Pakistan, the Canadians can slip happily below the radar. In a warm-up five match series with their nearest rivals, geographically at least, they lost 4-0 with one match washed out. Expectation isn't huge. Historically, the Maple Leafers can at least claim the bragging rights over the U.S. with a famous win in the first recorded international cricket match in 1844.\n\nThere’s a huge heritage in Canadian cricket and the continuation of the annual Auty Cup is a nod to the connection between the two nations on the green fields before baseball pitched up. Once upon a time on the prairie, cricket was declared Canada’s national sport by its first-ever PM John A Macdonald. The Toronto Cricket Club was established in 1827 although the inception of the game was strongly influenced by the missions of the Royal Navy and the British Army. George A. Barber, an English schoolmaster, was prominent in setting up the Toronto Club and is known as the father of Canadian cricket.\n\nThe most important development in recent times for the international team has been regaining their ODI status after almost a decade out of he mainstream loop. “Regaining (the ODI) status after nine long years is an outstanding achievement and a game-changing moment for Cricket Canada. It puts us on the same map as the leading Associate cricketing nations in the world,” said a jubilant former Cricket Canada President Rashpal Bajwa to the Emerging Cricket site this time last year.\n\nIt has been a long journey back for a country that had appeared in the 1979, 2003, 2007 and 2011 50-over World Cups before the ICC introduced the new World Cricket League divisional structure. This meant Associate members needed to finish in the top six of the World Cricket League Division 2 tournament. At their lowest ebb, Canada were languishing in League Division Three by 2017.\n\nThis has resulted in difficulties retaining a solid playing pool. In a 2015 interview with ESPNcricinfo, former captain Rizwan Cheema summed up the mood: “Once you slip down the pecking order [in Associate cricket] it's hard to climb out. It's hard to even have players for the team. If there's no career as a cricketer, how do you keep your players interested?\"\n\nNow the surge, the revival, is making the Maple Leaf fly in the wind again. Cricket is the fastest-growing sport in the country, supercharged with the return of the GT20, a franchise that first appeared with considerable success in 2018 when it attracted stars like Steve Smith, Chris Gayle, David Warner and Andre Russell. Before the pandemic, it was the most watched event in North America outside of the Super Bowl.\n\nIn the 2023 GT20 season, six teams were allocated $579,000 to spend on a 16-man roster with the proviso that at least six Canadians would be included and that three must be in the starting XI. That averaged at $36,000 per player and again attracted a healthy cohort of international stars who could energize and educate homegrown talent. Tim Southee, Mohammad Rizwan, Rassie van der Dussen, and World No. 1 allrounder Shakib Al Hasan were among the luminaries. Gayle, now very much in his dotage at 44, also returned for the fun as did Pakistan cricket legend Shahid Afridi.\n\nThe action took place in Ontario's Brampton sports complex which is aiming to morph into a major cricket international facility. The City has allocated $7 million for further growth although funding might be three or four times more than an estimated $49 million to expand the current CAA Centre from a 5,000-seater to a fully-fledged and equipped venue.\n\nThe tournament was broadcast to 110 countries around the world with an estimated television audience of about 150 million people globally, the vast majority of which was outside North America. The trick now is to grow the grassroots game and get away from the part-time \"weekend warriors\" contracts of the past. There's still a dearth of dedicated cricket grounds as many matches are played in multi-sport venues. Canada's elevation to League 2 will ensure the squad are paid salaries between $55,000 to $65,000 and will train full-time.\n\nCanada’s first venture into the T20 World Cup is led by 37-year-old skipper Saad Bin Zafar, a veteran of 38 T20Is. Like the U.S. team, most of the playing members are thirtysomething and of Indian or Pakistan origin although opening bat Aaron Johnson brings some Caribbean flair to the team. His 74 at Prairie View in the second T20 against the States in April came at a strike rate of 184 with six sixes. Canada will need something special from him in the real thing.",

At least two of the three American venues will host matches, with a site for the India v Bangladesh warm-up match on June 1 yet to be confirmed though the expectation is that it will be played at the newly unveiled Nassau County International Stadium.\n\nUSA’s pair of warm-up fixtures have been announced for May 28 and 30 to both be played at Grand Prairie Stadium, 12 miles west of Dallas, Texas. In a peculiar decision, USA will play Bangladesh in an official warm-up match on May 28 despite the fact that USA is already scheduled to play three official T20Is against Bangladesh at Prairie View Cricket Complex from May 21-25. USA’s second official warm-up match will be played against Nepal on May 30.\n\nNepal will also have an earlier warm-up match to be played against Canada on May 27 in Grand Prairie, which will be the first international matches of any kind – warm-up or full T20Is – to be played at Grand Prairie Stadium. The USA v Nepal match on May 30 will be part of a doubleheader in which the second match of the day will feature Netherlands against Canada to complete the set of four warm-up matches to be played at the facility which reopened in 2023 – and hosted the first season of the Major League Cricket T20 franchise tournament – following an estimated $20 million renovation from its original layout as a minor league baseball stadium.\n\nBroward County Stadium in Lauderhill, Florida will be hosting three warm-up matches, beginning on May 28 when Netherlands plays Sri Lanka. It will be the first of two warm-up matches for Sri Lanka at the facility. They will also take on Ireland on May 31 before both teams travel to New York ahead of their first matches of the tournament. Sri Lanka starts off their Group D slate against South Africa on June 3 at Nassau County International Stadium while Ireland opens on June 5 at the same venue against India.\n\nThe remaining warm-up fixture scheduled for Broward County Stadium is an intrasquad match for South Africa on May 29. It is the only intrasquad practice match officially scheduled by the ICC for any team in the tournament.\n\nThe final warm-up fixture between India and Bangladesh is yet to be given a designated venue by the ICC. The expectation is that it will be held in New York on June 1 at Nassau County International Stadium so that the ICC can have at least one match played on the new drop-in wickets that have been installed at the newly opened venue in Long Island, New York before the official first T20I is played at the venue on June 3. But if the New York venue – which took less than four months to complete at an estimated $30 million cost – is unavailable for any reason, the match may be held at Broward County Stadium or canceled outright because Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas will be unavailable that day since it is due to host the opening match of the tournament that night between USA and Canada.\n\nA total of eight other warm-up matches are slated to be held in Trinidad & Tobago – the only Caribbean venue due to host any official warm-up matches – at both Brian Lara Academy and Queen’s Park Oval. The only two Full Member to have two warm-ups scheduled in Trinidad are Australia and Afghanistan. Australia will play Namibia on May 28 and West Indies on May 30. Afghanistan are set to face Oman on May 29 and Scotland on May 31.\n\nAssociate sides Papua New Guinea, Oman, Uganda, Scotland and Namibia all have two warm-up matches scheduled. The only tournament participants not to have any warm-ups scheduled against other teams are England, South Africa, Pakistan, New Zealand and Zimbabwe.",

    "body": "The USA acquired ODI status in 2019 and are looking for active international cricketers so that they can make a strong squad to live up to the status. Several big names are in line to represent the USA in international cricket. USA Cricket received a major boost when Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan's Kolkata Knight Riders announced that it would invest in Major League cricket (MLC), a tournament emulating the IPL, as well as own a franchise in it.\n\nThe USA are targeting players who haven't been selected in international cricket for some time and are ready to shift there to rekindle their careers in cricket.\n\nThe Business Standard (TBS) looks at five cricketers who have recently opted to play cricket for the USA.\n\nCorey Anderson\n\nCorey Anderson, an explosive left-handed batter and a useful medium-pace bowler, is a great addition to the USA's cricket set-up. The former Black Caps all-rounder once held the record of the fastest century in ODIs. He has made 93 appearances for New Zealand across formats and won them several games. Anderson was part of the 2015 World Cup squad that came second in the tournament.\n\nThe all-rounder's international career has been plagued by injuries. The 30-year-old called time on his international career last year and signed a three-year deal with the USA's Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nSami Aslam\n\nSami Aslam captained Pakistan to the final of the 2014 Under-19 World Cup in the UAE. The talented left-handed batter made his international debut in 2015. Aslam played 13 Tests and four ODIs for Pakistan and since then he has fallen out of favor. In November 2020, the 25-year old cut ties with Pakistan Cricket with the aim of representing the USA.\n\nAslam said that he wasn't happy with the way he was treated and added that he was more than happy to be in America after being depressed in Pakistan for two years. He will be eligible to play for the USA in 2023. Recently he was selected in the players' draft ahead of Minor League Cricket (MLC).\n\nDane Piedt\n\nDane Piedt, former Protea off-spinner who played nine Tests, ended his association with Cricket South Africa last year and shifted to South Africa to play in the Minor League Cricket (MLC).\n\n\"It was an opportunity I just couldn't pass up, financially and for lifestyle reasons, but it was still a tough decision to make,\" he said.\n\nPiedt made his Test debut in 2014 and delivered a career-best performance to thump Zimbabwe. His last appearance in international cricket was in 2019 against India. Piedt is a prolific performer in South Africa's domestic set-up, having picked up more than 400 first-class wickets.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nShehan Jayasuriya is another exciting addition to USA Cricket as he retired from the Sri Lanka cricket team earlier this year and decided to relocate to the USA with his family. Jayasuriya is a handy all-around cricketer, batting left-handed and bowling right-arm off-spin. He played 30 international matches for Sri Lanka but couldn't really replicate the success he had in domestic cricket.\n\nJayasuriya last played an international match for Sri Lanka in March 2019. In June 2021, he was selected in the players' draft ahead of Minor League Cricket (MLC).\n\nUnmukt Chand\n\nUnmukt Chand was earmarked to become a superstar of Indian cricket after he led India to glory in the 2012 ICC Under-19 World Cup. He made a sensational hundred against Australia in the final of that tournament and became a household name in India. He played for India A regularly from 2013 to 2015. Chand represented three IPL franchises but failed to live up to his immense potential.\n\nThe 28-year-old cricketer has relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and signed a multi-year agreement with Major League Cricket in the USA. The 28-year old will be eligible to play for the USA after serving the residency period.",

    "body": "NEW YORK: The US cricket team which will co-host the Twenty20 World Cup may be a fitting cross-section of its country as a roster of migrants, a melting pot of nationalities and cultures.\n\nThe 15-man squad includes players born in India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa. Home-grown players include vice-captain Aaron Jones, who was born in Queens, and allrounder Steven Taylor, of Hialeah, Florida.\n\nThe team provides a snapshot of US cricket at this formative stage, as Major League Cricket jostles for its place in a crowded sporting market. The squad includes foreign players drawn to America by the MLC and local players given the chance to play cricket at a professional level in the United States\n\nThe home team’s most recognized member is the former New Zealand allrounder Corey Anderson. The 33-year-old Anderson played 13 Tests, 49 one-day internationals and 31 T20 internationals for New Zealand between 2013 and 2018 in a career limited by injuries.\n\nHe earned a place in cricket history for his 36-ball century in a one-day international between New Zealand and the West Indies on New Year’s Day, 2014. Anderson also has played in T20 leagues in Australia, India, the Caribbean and UAE before finding an MLC home at the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nAnderson made his first half-century for the US in their T20 win over Canada last month.\n\nMumbai-born Harmeet Singh, who played for India at two Under-19 World Cups, was the star for the 19th-ranked US team earlier this week in an upset win over Bangladesh. It the only the second win over a full ICC member for the US\n\nHe scored 33 from the 13 deliveries he faced and shared an unbeaten, match-winning 62-run partnership with Anderson, who was unbeaten on 34.\n\n“It means a lot to us to put on a show against Bangladesh. We are no walkovers,” Harmeet told ESPNcricinfo. “I think our potential is immense.”\n\nThe US meet Canada in the tournament opener on June 1 and then there’ll be a step up for both teams in Group A, which also includes India and Pakistan, fierce cricket rivals with enormous support, and Ireland.\n\nAmong the other foreign-born players on the US squad coached by ex-Australia batter Stuart Law is right-arm fast bowler Ali Khan, who moved with his parents from Pakistan to the US when he was 18.\n\nHe first played for the US team in 2016 and has also has played in the Indian Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and Pakistan Premier League, in Global T20 Canada and the Afghanistan Premier League.\n\nCaptain Monank Patel, a wicketkeeper-batsman, was born in India and settled in New Jersey after moving permanently to the US in 2016. He played at a junior level for Gujarat in India and played the first of his 47 one-day internationals and 23 T20 internationals for the US in 2019.\n\nAndries Gous, another wicketkeeper-batsmen, was born in Welkom, South Africa, played for South Africa at under-19 level and played 60 first-class matches before relocating to the US in 2021. He and Patel were the highest scorers for the US in the recent five-match series against Canada.\n\nAllrounder Milind Kumar is another India-born player who accumulated nine centuries in 60 first-class appearances for Delhi before making his home in the US\n\nThe Canada team scheduled to meet the US in the opening match is also a team drawn from many places and shaped by the evolution of a professional league at home.\n\nCanada will be led by the veteran left-armer spinner Saad bin Zafar, who was born in Pakistan. He moved to Canada to study and was first named in the Canadian T20 team in 2008. Now 37, he has played 38 T20 internationals and once took two wickets without conceding a run in four overs in a T20 against Panama.\n\nJamaica-born batter Aaron Johnson, Pakistan-born left-arm fast bowler Kaleem Sana and Guyana-born right-arm quick Dillon Heyliger reflect the international makeup of the team which is coached by former Sri Lanka international Pubudu Dassanayake.\n\nFred Trueman of Yorkshire and England was long regarded as his nation’s greatest fast bowler. In his prime, he bowled a thousand overs for Yorkshire during a summer.\n\nThis was an era when the only cricket matches on view, apart from Tests, were three-day county championships between 17 counties. In 1964, Trueman was the first bowler to claim 300 wickets in Test matches. When asked if he thought his achievement would be beaten, his response — typical of the man — was: “Aye, but whoever does it will be very tired.”\n\nSince then, 36 bowlers have beaten Trueman’s record. Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan claimed 800, followed by Australia’s Shane Warne with 708, and then there is England’s James Anderson, who has 700 and is due to play his last Test this year.\n\nAnderson’s longevity and fitness is truly remarkable. He has sent down almost 40,000 deliveries in Test matches alone, the fourth highest among those taking more than three hundred wickets. He is not admitting to any tiredness and is regarded by some as having claim to be England’s finest quick bowler, rather than Trueman. Both their achievements, in different eras, are extraordinary. Trueman’s feat was accompanied by a bowling average of 21.57, only bettered by Malcom Marshall (20.94) and Curtly Ambrose (20.99). Anderson’s is 26.52.\n\nIt is against the background of these achievements that current cries for help by professional cricketers to reduce their workload should be gauged. Another of Yorkshire’s finest players is Joe Root who, in 140 Tests for England so far, has scored 11,626 runs. This puts him 10th on the all-time list of top Test run scorers. His workload has been intense for years, even more so when he captained England in 64 Tests, yet he rarely complains. Last week, however, he called for a major rethink of English cricket’s crowded schedule.\n\nThis was accompanied by the Professional Cricketers Association calling for change “before something disastrous happens.”\n\nBased on a survey of professional male cricketers, the PCA revealed that key concerns are physical heath (81 percent), travel conditions (75 percent) and mental health (62 percent). Long-distance driving late at night, whether moving between matches or traveling home, is a particular worry. It is argued that player welfare and performance are compromised by the lack of time to recover, prepare and practice.\n\nProfessional cricket in England and Wales has a particular issue in that there are four men’s competitions shoe-horned into a window between mid-April and the end of September, with August given over entirely to The Hundred. Last year, proposals to reduce the amount of four-day county cricket and T20 cricket were rejected by the counties. Effectively, the 50 over competition has been downgraded because so few of the top players appear in it. According to Root, the objective should be to get “the standard of first-class and county cricket as close as you can to the international game.”\n\nProfessional cricketers in England and Wales have raised the issue of congested schedules and travelling pressure before. The explosion of T20 cricket in the last 20 years has increased this congestion and turned it into a more international concern. In India and Australia, for example, the distances between venues are much greater, with flying and its attendant risks additional factors.\n\nIn November 2023, during the announcement of India’s ODI squad for a series against Australia, India’s captain, Rohit Sharma, blamed excessive travel for injured players across the teams. It is in the interests of all cricket boards to narrow the gap between the standard of the breeding ground of first-class cricket and international cricket. Each one has different ways of doing so, a reflection of relative resources, geography and historic structures.\n\nIn India, reform is proposed for 2024-25. It seems likely that the Ranji Trophy, the country’s state-based long format game and the equivalent of the English county championship, will be split into two halves. White ball tournaments would be held in between. The main drivers behind this are to address variable winter weather conditions in the north and to allow longer gaps between matches to facilitate travel and recovery. This is similar reasoning to that aired by Joe Root and the PCA.\n\nMore forgiving schedules may release pressure on mental health, an often-overlooked facet of professional sport. There have been a number of high-profile cases in recent years in cricket. Azeem Rafiq’s experience of racism at Yorkshire was one. Another was Jonathan Trott, who played 52 Tests for England between 2009 and 2015. He left England’s tour of Australia in November 2013, unable to cope with the demands at that level. A man with very high levels of concentration lost them and referred to the impact of social media, saying: “People don't look you in the face and have a conversation and ask you how you are.”\n\nRohit Sharma, in the aftermath of India’s defeat in the 2023 ODI World Cup Final, was mentally shattered. He eschewed social media and opted out of ODI and T20I assignments against South Africa. Men’s cricket is a tough environment that appears not to appreciate that mental health issues are real. The growth of women’s cricket has brought about a change in approaches to mental health within the game. A webinar which I joined this week promoted by the Cricket Research Network discussed the different physiological challenges which women face in advancing in the game.\n\nQuite what Fred Trueman would have made of this is an open question. He was an un-constituted menacing quick bowler who bullied opponents. It is not unreasonable to assume he would have been aghast at the notion of women playing professional cricket.\n\nAfter his playing days were over, he became a pundit and commentator. His catch line was: “I don’t know what is going on.” He would be even more at a loss in today’s world of social media and Bollywood-style cricket.\n\nMUMBAI: Nicholas Pooran starred in Lucknow Super Giants’ 18-run victory over pre-tournament favorites Mumbai Indians in the last game of a disappointing Indian Premier League season for both teams Friday.\n\nThe maverick West Indies’ wicketkeeper-batsman hit eight sixes in his 29-ball 75 to take Lucknow to 214-6 after Mumbai skipper Hardik Pandya won the toss and chose to field first.\n\nMumbai crashed to 196-6 despite an impressive start by openers Rohit Sharma and Dewald Brevis in their rain-interrupted chase.\n\nPandya said that it was “quite difficult” for five-time champions Mumbai, who finished the 10-team league in last spot.\n\n“This season we didn’t play good quality cricket and it cost us the whole season,” Pandya said.\n\nLucknow too failed to qualify for the playoffs and ended the tournament in sixth spot.\n\nCaptain KL Rahul said that it was “very disappointing.”\n\nHe blamed mid-season injuries to key players and said that they “didn’t play well enough collectively and couldn’t come together” as a team.\n\nEarlier, Nuwan Thushara got Mumbai off to a great start and removed opener Devdutt Padikkal for a first ball duck.\n\nPadikkal’s partner Rahul stitched together a 48-run partnership with Australia’s Marcus Stoinis, who fell to Piyush Chawla’s leg-spin for a 22-ball 28 in the sixth over.\n\nChawla also removed Deepak Hooda (11) to reduce Lucknow to 69-3 by the 10th over.\n\nThushara finally removed Pooran in the 17th over to end his match-defining, 109-run partnership with Rahul.\n\nHe also removed rookie Arshad Khan (0) in the same over and finished with 3-28 in his four-over spell.\n\nChawla removed Rahul, who took 41 balls for his 55 runs, in the 18th over and finished with 3-29.\n\nKey unbeaten cameos by Ayush Badoni (22) and Krunal Pandya (12) took Lucknow to 214-6.\n\nMumbai’s openers took their team to 88 before Brevis fell for 23 in the ninth over.\n\nIndia skipper Sharma top-scored with a 38-ball 68 with 10 fours and three sixes before he fell in the 11th over.\n\nIn between, Mumbai also lost their best T20 batsman, Suryakumar Yadav, for 0 and were reduced to 97-3 while out-of-form skipper Pandya fell for 16.\n\nIndian rookie Naman Dhir hit five sixes and four fours in his unbeaten 28-ball 62.\n\nLeg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi, who removed Sharma, and Afghanistan’s Naveen-ul-Haq, who removed Brevis, took four key Mumbai wickets between them.\n\nOn May 11, the second of a four-day county championship match unfolded in front of my eyes at the Utilita Bowl, Southampton. This is the home of Hampshire County Cricket Club. On a rare sunny day, there seemed to be around 600 other people watching, a majority in the members’ area.\n\nHampshire CCC is unusual in that it is one of three out of the 18 county cricket clubs in England and Wales that are not subject to member votes. It is owned by Hampshire Sport & Leisure Holdings, a private limited company which oversees sporting and leisure activities on the site. Its former chair, who was instrumental in saving the county from insolvency in 2001, owns 60 percent of the shares.\n\nBy coincidence, Hampshire’s opponents were Durham County Cricket Club, another county not subject to member votes. It is constituted as a Community Interest Company, a form of social enterprise. Northamptonshire County Cricket Club is the third one not to be subject to member votes, being constituted as a private company limited by guarantee.\n\nThe scene at Southampton would have been replicated at the other five county championship matches taking place on May 11. At the same time in Kolkata, the Knight Riders and the Mumbai Indians were preparing to play the 60th match of the 2024 Indian Premier League franchise competition. Average spectator attendance in the IPL is estimated to be 30,000. These two different models of promoting cricket may be about to coalesce, if proposed changes to the landscape in England and Wales come to fruition.\n\nThe changes center on The Hundred, a format of cricket introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board in 2021. The two teams each play a single innings of 100 deliveries, divided into 20 overs of five deliveries, with two overs bowled from each end alternately. Each match is scheduled to last for two-and-a-half hours. Eight men’s teams and eight women’s teams comprise separate competitions with all matches played back-to-back on the same day at the same venue. The whole of August is allocated to The Hundred to the exclusion of other formats.\n\nEver since its inception, the tournament has been divisive on several levels. First, it has segregated the 18 counties into those who host The Hundred and those who do not. The eight participating counties are Glamorgan, Hampshire, Lancashire, Middlesex, Nottinghamshire, Surrey, Warwickshire and Yorkshire. However, the teams do not carry the county names, since the concept was to create city-based teams using existing county facilities. Agreement to progress with the tournament depended upon the support of excluded counties. This was achieved by the ECB’s offer to pay each county £1.3 million ($1.6 million) for their backing.\n\nAt a second level, there are differing opinions about the opportunity cost of this funding. The ECB receives around 75 percent of its income from the sale of broadcasting rights, a substantial part of which relates to Test-match cricket. Critics argue that using this money to support and develop a format which represents an existential threat to Test cricket is willful. They argue that the funds should be deployed in producing players for the longer rather than shorter formats.\n\nOn a third level, it is argued that the focus on eight counties, instead of 18, will hasten the demise of some of the latter, several of whom are in parlous financial circumstances. It is understood that, in the last two years, five counties have received financial help from the ECB. Overall debt levels in county cricket may be in the order of £200 million, some of this being incurred in stadium development designed to host international matches. In addition, operational costs have increased sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is in this context that the ECB’s current proposal to sell off 49 percent of equity in The Hundred has great attraction. The balance of 51 percent would be owned by the host county, which can decide to retain it all or sell part or all of it. The proceeds of the 49 percent are to be distributed to counties according to an undisclosed formula. The ECB requested that counties agreed to a “direction of travel” by May 10.\n\nA divergence of opinion has emerged amongst the counties about the proposed model for distributing the spoils, split broadly between those who host The Hundred and those who do not. Needless to say, both sides appear to want more. In terms of numbers, some reports assert that the ECB’s sale of 49 percent equity might raise some $507 million (£400 million) for distribution, enough to salve the cash problems of a few counties. It is understandable that the non-hosting counties fear that they could get sold down the river.\n\nThere is already a fear that they are becoming marginalized by not being a host of The Hundred format. If the money raised by the ECB falls well short of the $507 million, then their financial problems may not be solved and their marginalization exacerbated. There are also legitimate concerns over governance and scheduling issues once private owners become involved. At this stage, the nature of private investors is unknown. It would be no surprise if Indian franchise owners show interest. However, it is reasonable to assume that they would not be content with either a minority stake or minority voice.\n\nCricket in England and Wales is at a watershed moment, caught in a maze of alternative possibilities, each one of which has unknown consequences. The ECB, under previous management, was the architect of this moment, through its introduction of The Hundred, which is contracted to run until 2028. In a twist of fate, it is now regarded as a medium for escape from impecunity. The alternative to equity sale is to do nothing and watch the system crumble. Equity sale will be tantamount to privatizing a part of that system. It was difficult to escape the feeling at Southampton that I was watching one part of that system which is heading for trauma.\n\nGUWAHATI, India: Skipper Sam Curran starred with bat and ball as Punjab Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by five wickets for a consolation win in the Indian Premier League on Wednesday.\n\nChasing a tricky 145 on a sluggish pitch, Punjab depended on Curran’s unbeaten 63 to achieve their target with seven balls to spare in Rajasthan’s adopted home ground in Guwahati.\n\nLeft-handed Curran put on a key 63-run stand with Jitesh Sharma, who made 22, and despite losing his partner in the 16th over steered the team home to lift them from the bottom of the 10-team table.\n\nImpact substitute Ashutosh Sharma smashed 17 and the winning run to hand Rajasthan their fourth successive defeat in this edition of the T20 tournament.\n\n“To be very honest, we have to sit back and accept that we are going through some failures,” Rajasthan skipper Sanju Samson said.\n\n“You have to find out what’s not working well as a team. When you are getting to the business end, we need someone to raise their finger up and say I am going to win the game for the team. We have the players who can do that.”\n\nThe loss for Rajasthan hurt their chances of a top-two finish in the league stage a day after they confirmed their play-off spot.\n\nRajasthan, who stay in second place with one game in hand, and table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders are the only two teams to have booked their play-off berth.\n\nThe top four teams make the play-offs, but the first and second-placed sides have the advantage of two chances to qualify for the final on May 26 in Chennai.\n\nPunjab, who had already bowed out of the play-off race, kept the opposition down to 144-9 despite a 34-ball 48 by Riyan Parag.\n\nLeft-arm quick Curran bowled Yashasvi Jaiswal, for four, in the first over and then Samson departed for 18 off Nathan Ellis after a slow start.\n\nParag found Ravichandran Ashwin, who hit 28 off 19 balls, for company and the two attempted to push the scoring in their partnership of 50.\n\nThe rest of the batting faltered against a disciplined attack as Curran, fellow quick Harshal Patel and spinner Rahul Chahal took two wickets each.\n\nNEW DELHI: Fiery fifties from Abishek Porel and Tristan Stubbs helped Delhi Capitals sign off their IPL league phase on a high as they beat Lucknow Super Giants by 19 runs on Tuesday.\n\nThe win took Delhi to 14 points in 14 matches and they remain technically in the mix to reach the play-offs of the T20 tournament, but a run-rate in the negative keeps their chances slim.\n\n“We are still in contention even after the last game,” Delhi skipper Rishabh Pant said after he returned to lead the side following a one-match ban for slow over-rate.\n\n“We had a better chance of qualifying if I would have had a chance to play in the last game (which Delhi lost).”\n\nThe left-handed Porel hit 58 before Stubbs smashed an unbeaten 57 off 25 balls to steer Delhi to 208-4 after being invited to bat first at their high-scoring home venue, Arun Jaitley Stadium.\n\nPant, a left-handed wicketkeeper-batsman, made 33 to cap off an impressive season after he came back in the IPL from a horror car crash in December 2022.\n\n“Personally, it was fantastic to come back,” said Pant, who has been picked in India’s squad for the T20 World Cup next month.\n\n“It was heartening to see the support from entire India. Was a long time to wait after one-and-a-half years. I want to be on the field all the time. Don’t want to miss any action.”\n\nKL Rahul-led Lucknow have 12 points with one more match to play and have their hopes hanging by a thread.\n\nThe result confirmed a play-off spot for Rajasthan Royals, who became the second team to enter the final four alongside table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nThe top four teams make the play-offs. The final is on May 26 in Chennai.\n\nIshant Sharma led the bowling charge with three early wickets as Delhi restricted Lucknow to 189-9 despite valiant knocks from Nicholas Pooran, who smashed 61, and Arshad Khan, who hit an unbeaten 58.\n\nDelhi lost attacking opener Jake Fraser-McGurk for a duck but Porel and Shai Hope, who struck 38, put on 92 runs to lay the foundations of the big total.\n\nDelhi stuttered in the middle after they lost Porel, Hope and then Pant at regular intervals and Lucknow bowlers checked the flow of runs.\n\nBut Stubbs had other ideas and he hit back with a flurry of fours and sixes to fire Delhi past the 200 as the last three overs cost Lucknow 45 runs.\n\nLucknow suffered early blows after pace spearhead Ishant took down Rahul, for five, and Quinton de Kock, for 12, inside three overs.\n\nMarcus Stoinis was stumped by Pant off spinner Axar Patel and Ishant, who was named man of the match, struck again to make Lucknow slip to 44-4.\n\nStubbs made it count with his off-spin as he sent back impact substitute Ayush Badoni out for six to end a 27-run partnership with Pooran.\n\nThe left-handed Pooran attempted to drive the chase in his 27-ball knock laced with six fours and four sixes but he left a lot to be done when he departed in the 12th over.\n\nNumber eight Arshad then raised hopes of a turnaround with his late charge as he raised his first T20 50 in 25 balls to give Delhi a scare.\n\nArshad kept losing partners as he continued the charge but in the end failed to match up the asking-rate.",

    "date": "Mon May 20 11:43:00 2024",
    "body": "The Prairie View Cricket Complex is a group of six cricket grounds located in the city of Prairie View, part of the Greater Houston area in Texas, United States.\n\nJointly-owned by Pakistani American businessman Tanweer Ahmed and Major League Cricket, the Prairie View Cricket Complex was established in 2018 and has a seating capacity of 10,000.\n\nThe Prairie View Cricket Complex is an 86-acre facility that is entirely devoted to cricket. It comprises five turf wicket cricket grounds and a hybrid turf ground.\n\nThe massive cricket complex now hosts about 20 tournaments and around 500 games annually along with MLC.\n\nIt staged its first international cricket match, a T20 played between hosts United States and Canada in April 2024. The hosts won the game by six wickets.\n\nSince then, it has hosted four T20 internationals. It will also stage the upcoming USA vs Bangladesh T20I series ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nLet’s have a closer look at the Prairie View Cricket Complex T20 records and stats.\n\nPrairie View Cricket Complex T20 records and stats\n\nHighest total\n\nThe United States national cricket team holds the record for the highest total at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in T20 cricket. During the second T20I of Canada’s tour of the United States of America, the Monank Patel-led hosts posted 230/3 in their 20 overs against Canada in April 2024. The United States rode on fifties from captain Monank Patel (68), Andries Gous (57) and Steven Taylor (54) to post a record T20 total at the venue. In reply, Canada were bowled out for 199 in 19.4 overs as the hosts won the game by 31 runs.\n\nLowest total\n\nThe Canada national cricket team registered the lowest total at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in the T20 format. Put into bat, the visitors were bundled out for 132 in the first T20I of Canada’s tour of the United States of America in April 2024.Captain Saad Bin Zafar top-scored for Canada with 29 off 16 balls. For the USA, left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was the wrecker-in-chief with three wickets. The hosts later chased down the target in 17.3 overs to win the game by six wickets.\n\nMost runs\n\nCanada’s Aaron Johnson has scored the most runs at the venue in T20 cricket. The swashbuckling right-handed batter has amassed 124 runs in four T20 matches at an average of 31 and a strike rate of 144.18. The United States national cricket team captain Monank Patel features second on the list with 120 runs in three T20 matches at an average of 40 and a strike rate of 169.01.\n\nMost wickets\n\nUSA’s Harmeet Singh and Shadley van Schalkwyk share the record for the most wickets at this cricket ground in the T20 format. Left-arm spinner Harmeet Singh has claimed six wickets in four T20I games at an average of 12.66 and an economy of 5.56. Meanwhile, right-arm medium pacer Shadley van Schalkwyk has also picked up six T20I wickets in four matches at an average of 22.16 and an economy of 9.50.\n\nHighest individual score\n\nAaron Johnson has the record for the highest individual score at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in T20 cricket. Canada’s star opening batter Aaron Johnson slammed 74 off just 40 balls while chasing USA’s 230/3 in the second T20I of a five-match series in April 2024. Johnson’s scintillating knock was laced with six fours and six maximums. Despite his impressive knock, Canada fell short by 31 runs in Texas.\n\nBest bowling figures\n\nIndian-American cricketer Harmeet Singh has the best bowling figures at this venue in the T20 format. The USA left-arm spinner registered match-winning figures of 4/18 against Canada in the fourth T20I of a five-match series. Defending 159, Harmeet Singh dismissed Aaron Johnson, Dilpreet Bajwa, Pargat Singh and wicketkeeper-batter Shreyas Movva to restrict Canada to 145/6 in their 20 overs. Harmeet’s impressive spell helped USA register a 14-run victory in Texas\n\nHighest partnership\n\nUnited States’ Monank Patel and Steven Taylor hold the record for the highest partnership at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in T20 cricket. Monank Patel and Steven Taylor forged a 104-run partnership for the opening wicket against Canada in the second T20I. While Taylor scored 54, Monank slammed 68. USA won the game by 31 runs. Another USA duo Nitish Kumar and Corey Anderson switched a 104-run stand for the fourth wicket against Canada in the fifth T20I. Nitish hammered 64 while Anderson scored 55 to guide the USA to a four-wicket win in Texas.\n\nPhoto credit: Alamy",

Former New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson and Indian under-19 star Harmeet Singh are among the marquee names.\n\nIt was Singh who sparked the discussions of the USA being no pushovers after his side recently registered a historic win over Bangladesh.\n\n“We are no walkovers. I think our potential is immense. We have a lot of match-winners on the team. It gives us the edge. We bat as well now. The way the boys have been training, it is a personal effort from everybody. It means a lot to us to put on a show against Bangladesh,” Harmeet said as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.\n\nAlso read: ICC unveils new anthem composed by Grammy award-winning Lorne Balfe\n\nUS might give tough time to Pakistan: Ramiz Raja\n\nThe 31-year-old believes the team's flexibility and the players having skills which could prove to be hurtful for any opponent on any given date.\n\n\"A lot of guys can also bowl two to four overs, like Steven [Taylor] did. Nitish [Kumar] and Milind [Kumar] can bowl a few overs. We have bench strength too. The competition within the team is helping us. Everyone wants to do well, and that's helping the side,\" he added.\n\nThe USA also consists of quality overseas recruits like Pakistan-born fast bowler Ali Khan, who has played in big franchise cricket around the globe like IPL, CPL, and PSL.\n\nAlso read: Harmeet Singh gives bold statement after handing Bangladesh upsetting defeat\n\nTheir captain Monank Patel is an Indian-born wicketkeeper batter who has represented the USA since 2019. South African gloveman Andries Gous and Indian all-rounder Milind Kumar, with over 6000 first-class runs.\n\nFormer PCB chairman Ramiz Raja is among those warning the big teams not to underestimate the USA team's potential in the upcoming tournament.\n\n\"I think the US might give tough time to Pakistan because they also have some expats from India and Pakistan playing for them,\" he said.",

    "body": "The second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) is scheduled to start on July 5. However, this year it will clash with the Hundred, as both leagues overlap for six days in July. This could lead to some overseas players arriving in the UK late for the Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has been in discussions with counties, aiming to reach an agreement this week.\n\nAccording to their latest proposal, each Hundred team's host county (or MCC, for London Spirit) would receive a 51 percent share, with the ECB retaining the remaining 49 percent. By the end of the year, the ECB plans to sell this 49 percent share and distribute the revenue among English cricket. This move aims to ensure the financial sustainability of both the Hundred and the English game as a whole.\n\nAlso Read: Glenn Maxwell signs up to play for Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket\n\n\"Who gets what within that 49%? That's where the conversation will be over the next couple of weeks. What’s the best way to spread that money around the 18 counties - if you include the MCC, 19 - to try and create a more sustainable, vibrant foundation for the county system?” Stuart Cain, Warwickshire's chief executive was quoted as saying by ESPN Cricinfo.\n\nCrossover that has caused headaches for organizers\n\nThe Hundred's group stage kicks off on July 23, while Major League Cricket (MLC) concludes on July 28, including knockout matches from July 24. Twelve overseas players contracted for the Hundred have already committed to MLC, with more likely to follow before MLC begins on July 5.\n\nAlso Read: Invest in Major League Cricket now; Payoff will be big in future: Eric Garcetti, US Ambassador to India\n\nMost of these players will remain in the US until their MLC franchises exit the tournament. This crossover has posed challenges for scheduling and player availability. It also impacts both leagues as they try to procure shared player pools and fixture clashes.",

    "title": "MLC 2024 to begin on July 5, set for six-day clash with The Hundred",
    "date": "Tue May  7 14:05:00 2024",
    "body": "Twelve out of the 24 overseas players under contract in the Hundred could arrive late in the UK\n\nHalf of the overseas players in the men's Hundred could arrive in the UK late this year after Major League Cricket (MLC) confirmed on Tuesday that the two leagues will overlap by six days in July.\n\nLast year, the inaugural season of MLC ended two days before the start of the Hundred but the leagues will clash this year. The Hundred's group stage starts on July 23 while MLC will run until the final on July 28, with the knockout fixtures - which will feature four of the six franchises - starting July 24.\n\nTwelve out of the 24 overseas players under contract in the men's Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in MLC and more could follow before the tournament starts on July 5. The vast majority of them will stay in the US until their respective franchises are eliminated.\n\nRelated\n\n'It's not rocket science' - CPL's CEO asks T20 leagues to collaborate on scheduling\n\nMLC: Rashid, Pooran, Boult, Rauf among overseas players retained\n\nTravis Head joins Steven Smith at Washington Freedom for MLC 2024\n\nTexas Super Kings snap up Mitchell for MLC 2024, Shepherd goes to MI New York\n\nESPNcricinfo understands that Stephen Fleming is likely to buck the trend by prioritising the Hundred. Fleming, who is in India with Chennai Super Kings, coaches Texas Super Kings in MLC but his Hundred team, Southern Brave, have received assurances that he will arrive in the UK before their opening fixture on July 24. Fleming did not respond when contacted.\n\nDepending on which MLC franchises reach the playoffs, some Hundred teams could be without two or even three overseas players for their opening fixture. Fleming's Brave, for example, could be missing Kieron Pollard (MI New York), Akeal Hosein (Washington Freedom) and Finn Allen (San Francisco Unicorns) for their first match.\n\nPlayer wages in MLC were higher than in the men's Hundred last year. The top salary in MLC was around US$175,000 (£135,000 approx.) for a minimum of five games across two-and-a-half weeks; in the men's Hundred, the top salary was £125,000 (US$155,000 approx.) for a minimum of eight games across four weeks.\n\nThe men's Hundred is likely to be short on star power for the opening week, also clashing with the third England vs West Indies Test at Edgbaston which runs from July 26-30. Availability is much better in the women's Hundred, where the only relevant clash is a brief overlap with the Asia Cup.\n\nMLC will start on July 5 - a day later than initially planned - and the 21-match group stage will run until July 23. Each team will play seven group fixtures. The four knockout fixtures have been scheduled for July 24 (Eliminator), 25 (Qualifier), 26 (Challenger) and 28 (final). As well as the Hundred, it will directly clash with the Lanka Premier League which is due to run July 1-21.\n\nLike last year, two venues will be used: Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. The ICC said earlier this year that MLC were evaluating the possibility of using the 'modular' stadium in Eisenhower Park, near New York - which will host eight T20 World Cup matches in June - but those plans have been shelved.\n\nMLC has proved particularly attractive to Australian players this year, with Steven Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell and Jake Fraser-McGurk all due to feature. Two MLC franchises have links with Australian states - Washington Freedom (New South Wales) and San Francisco Unicorns (Victorians) - while a Seattle Orcas squad recently toured Queensland.\n\nA desire to attract the best overseas players in the world is among several reasons underpinning the ECB's plan to sell equity stakes in Hundred teams to private investors later this year. Richard Gould, the ECB's chief executive, said last month that there is a \"strong consensus that we would like to see private investment come into the Hundred\".\n\nThe ECB have been meeting counties regularly and hope they will agree on a direction of travel this week. Under their latest proposals, they would gift a 51% share in each Hundred team to its host county (or MCC, in the case of London Spirit) and would sell the other 49% itself by the end of the year, sharing the revenue generated across the English game.\n\n\"Who gets what within that 49%? That's where the conversation will be over the next couple of weeks,\" Stuart Cain, Warwickshire's chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra last week. \"What's the best way to spread that money around the 18 counties - if you include the MCC, 19 - to try and create a more sustainable, vibrant foundation for the county system?\"\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",

    "title": "Inside the American T20 revolution",
    "date": "",
    "body": "The USA team created history by beating Bangladesh in a T20I series ©USA Cricket\n\n'Jo bhi karna hain bada karna hain! (Aim for the stars, always!) We want to build something that will outlive our lifetimes' quipped MLC (Major League Cricket) co-founder Sameer Mehta, the co-founder of American Cricket Enterprise in 2019 after winning the rights to own and operate a T20 league in USA. It is understood that the bid was unanimously approved by all the sitting directors at USA Cricket at the time over bids from industry incumbents including some of the IPL franchises.\n\nWhat was the catch? ACE inked the deal based on their intent to build cricketing infrastructure in the country, which was virtually non-existent in the country. The erstwhile USACA had zero turf wickets under their ambit in their half a century long existence. The ACE proposal further promised to leverage that infrastructure to build cricketing ecosystems and pathways.\n\nMuch like their peers at GT20 (Canada) or the now-defunct Euro T20, ACE had a chance to launch a flaky T20 league, ensuring a revenue stream right from the onset. But they went down a different route, taking a bottom-to-top approach, the group made heavy investments in setting up academies and turf wicket grounds across the country. The launch of MLC was preceded by the inception of the Minor League (MiLC), a 26-team pathway franchise tournament that now underpins the MLC. ACE launched the MLC, after 2 successful MiLC seasons had laid the initial groundwork and 4 years after clinching the winning bid.\n\nWhile the world watches American cricket basking in the glory of a historic series win over Bangladesh, it is oblivious to the T20 revolution that has been brewing in America since the advent of ACE. The MiLC with over 150 games a year and the long weekend pop-up T20 tournaments like the Houston Open have completely changed the landscape of American cricket.\n\nSomeone like Andries Gous, one of the many fresh faces in the USA lineup, who also enjoys stints at Abu Dhabi T10 and the ILT20 plays around 80 T20 games in a calendar year in USA which is close to a 10-fold increase from what he played in South Africa before moving to the US in 2021.\n\n\"My power game has definitely improved since coming to America, because we play so much T20 cricket. I think I sort of figured the way I want to play T20 cricket in these last three years. I think I'm 100% a better cricketer than I was in 2021 when I left South Africa\" said Gous after his whirlwind knock of 95 in 50 deliveries at the ILT20 in January.\n\nSimilarly left arm spinning all-rounder Harmeet Singh, who re-invented the wheel with a more round-arm action is now the most potent left-arm spinner in the country. He shunned away his fluidly orthodox action, one that was compared to Bishan Bedi because of the amount of T20 cricket he plays in America. It is also in America where Hamreet rediscovered his mojo with the bat. Playing T20 cricket day in and out, he transformed himself from a handy lower-order bat to a serious match-winner at the death, evident with his breathtaking cameo of 33 from 13 in the first T20I against Bangladesh.\n\nThe import of these professionals to spike the quality of cricket in America has raised the bar for the standard of cricket prevalent in America today. The MLC, with its domestic purse of $1.9m to go with MiLC purses of around $400,000 and about another $400,000 of player payments for the long weekend pop-up tournaments in all, the ecosystem now sustains about 35 professional cricketers making close to $60,000 per annum on an average.\n\nThe country now has about 20 turf wicket grounds scattered around the country, the construction of which has been either directly undertaken by ACE or has come up because of a tremendous snowball effect. The emergence of MLC has spiked investment from private groups and benefactors alike and has seen cricketing infrastructure in terms of turf grounds, indoor facilities, and ad-hoc cash tournaments grow by leaps and bounds. An average MiLC team owner burns close to $120,000 in cash every season while ACE has spent around $80m of their own for venue construction, high-performance camps, logistics and player salaries.\n\nThe recent on-field success of the American team has resultantly not been a flash in the pan, but instead, the sweet fruits of thoughtful labour put into the brittle ecosystem of American cricket which had endured many false dawns in the past.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet",

    "body": "The U.S. cricket team which will co-host the Twenty20 World Cup may be a fitting cross-section of its country as a roster of migrants, a melting pot of nationalities and cultures.\n\nThe 15-man squad includes players born in India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa. Home-grown players include vice-captain Aaron Jones, who was born in Queens, and allrounder Steven Taylor, of Hialeah, Florida.\n\nThe team provides a snapshot of U.S. cricket at this formative stage, as Major League Cricket jostles for its place in a crowded sporting market. The squad includes foreign players drawn to America by the MLC and local players given the chance to play cricket at a professional level in the United States\n\nThe home team’s most recognized member is the former New Zealand allrounder Corey Anderson. The 33-year-old Anderson played 13 tests, 49 one-day internationals and 31 T20 internationals for New Zealand between 2013 and 2018 in a career limited by injuries.\n\nHe earned a place in cricket history for his 36-ball century in a one-day international between New Zealand and the West Indies on New Year’s Day, 2014. Anderson also has played in T20 leagues in Australia, India, the Caribbean and United Arab Emirates before finding an MLC home at the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nAnderson made his first half-century for the U.S. in its T20 win over Canada last month.\n\nMumbai-born Harmeet Singh, who played for India at two Under-19 World Cups, was the star for the 19th-ranked U.S. team earlier this week in an upset win over Bangladesh. It the only the second win over a full ICC member for the U.S.\n\nHe scored 33 from the 13 deliveries he faced and shared an unbeaten, match-winning 62-run partnership with Anderson, who was unbeaten on 34.\n\n“It means a lot to us to put on a show against Bangladesh. We are no walkovers,” Harmeet told ESPNcricinfo. “I think our potential is immense.”\n\nThe U.S. meets Canada in the tournament opener on June 1 and then there’ll be a step up for both teams in Group A, which also includes India and Pakistan, fierce cricket rivals with enormous support, and Ireland.\n\nAmong the other foreign-born players on the U.S. squad coached by ex-Australia batter Stuart Law is right-arm fast bowler Ali Khan, who moved with his parents from Pakistan to the United States when he was 18.\n\nHe first played for the U.S. team in 2016 and has also has played in the Indian Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and Pakistan Premier League, in Global T20 Canada and the Afghanistan Premier League.\n\nCaptain Monank Patel, a wicketkeeper-batsman, was born in India and settled in New Jersey after moving permanently to the U.S. in 2016. He played at a junior level for Gujarat in India and played the first of his 47 one-day internationals and 23 T20 internationals for the U.S. in 2019.\n\nAndries Gous, another wicketkeeper-batsmen, was born in Welkom, South Africa, played for South Africa at under-19 level and played 60 first-class matches before relocating to the U.S. in 2021. He and Patel were the highest scorers for the U.S. in the recent five-match series against Canada.\n\nAllrounder Milind Kumar is another India-born player who accumulated nine centuries in 60 first-class appearances for Delhi before making his home in the U.S.\n\nThe Canada team scheduled to meet the U.S. in the opening match is also a team drawn from many places and shaped by the evolution of a professional league at home.\n\nCanada will be led by the veteran left-armer spinner Saad bin Zafar, who was born in Pakistan. He moved to Canada to study and was first named in the Canadian T20 team in 2008. Now 37, he has played 38 T20 internationals and once took two wickets without conceding a run in four overs in a T20 against Panama.\n\nJamaica-born batter Aaron Johnson, Pakistan-born left-arm fast bowler Kaleem Sana and Guyana-born right-arm quick Dillon Heyliger reflect the international makeup of the team which is coached by former Sri Lanka international Pubudu Dassanayake.\n\n___\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",

    "body": "Table of Contents\n\nThe second season of America’s marquee T20 league, Major League Cricket (MLC) will commence on America’s Independence Day i.e., July 4. The organizers had to start the tournament in July as the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 is expected to be played in June and will conclude just four days before the start of MLC. The T20 World Cup will be hosted by West Indies and the USA.\n\nThe first season of the MLC was concluded early due to international window constraints. The matches in the first season were played in the round-robin format. However, this time around, it is being planned to keep the league in a home-away double round-robin league format. Major League Cricket’s first season saw six teams competing against each other.\n\nMLC has not disclosed the venues for the second season. It is understood that there are possibilities that MLC could add two more venues for season 2. Apart from the Grand Prairie and Morrisville venues, Major League Cricket looks keen on leveraging the pop-up venue in Long Island, NY with a 34000 seating capacity set to be erected by the ICC for the T20 World Cup. The upcoming facility at George Mason University has been identified by the MLC for warm-up matches of the World Cup.\n\nAlso Read: Mohammed Shami Ruled Out Of India’s Test Series, Deepak Chahar To Miss ODI Series Due To Family Emergency\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) Provides A Perfect Platform For American Cricket\n\n“The tremendous success of the inaugural Major League Cricket season provides a perfect platform to propel American cricket to even greater heights in 2024,” said Justin Geale, Tournament Director, Major League Cricket. “We expect to see even more world-class players participating in season two of Major League Cricket, creating an incredible summer for the sport in America along with the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.”\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC attracted some top signings at large signing amounts surpassing established leagues like the Big Bash League and the SA20 League in average salary per league game. The second season of Major League Cricket is expected to retain most of the white-ball players that featured in the last season as the window stands clear of any white-ball cricket scheduled for teams like England, Australia, New Zealand, West Indies, and Pakistan.\n\nMI New York won the inaugural season of the Major League Cricket and the franchise will be looking to win another season. Nicholas Pooran led the team in the finals and scored a brilliant ton to take his team over the line against the Seattle Orcas in the finals.\n\nAlso Read: Suryakumar Yadav Reacts With Broken-Heart Emoji To Hardik Pandya’s Announcement As MI Skipper For IPL 2024",

    "body": "The anticipation is growing for the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) as the American professional T20 competition looks to capitalize on a successful debut. The upcoming season is set to kick off on July 5 with a double header between defending champions MI New York and Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season’s final. The tournament will conclude on July 27, with the latter stages overlapping with England’s Hundred competition. MLC officials initially aimed for a mid-June to mid-July schedule to avoid clashes, but the T20 World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S, ended in late June this year.\n\nMLC has seen high demand for pre-sale tickets since announcing the season’s schedule, indicating a growing enthusiasm for cricket in America. Chief Executive Vijay Srinivasan expressed delight in providing fans across the nation the opportunity to witness top-tier cricket live in their own backyard. The success of the first season has set a foundation for MLC to establish itself as one of the premier T20 leagues in the world. The goal is to continue expanding the sport in the United States and engage the community, both as fans and participants.\n\nAttendance numbers for last season were impressive, with around 70,000 fans turning out for the tournament played at venues such as the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the Church Street Park in Morrisville. The second season will see an expansion of six games, with teams set to play seven matches in the group stages leading up to four playoff games. While MLC officials aim to eventually have a home-and-away season, this will only be feasible once all franchises have home grounds. Player wages in the league will remain competitive, with top players earning $175,000 for a minimum of five games.\n\nMLC has been able to attract marquee Australian signings, such as Steve Smith, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head, due to Australia having no international commitments after the T20 World Cup. The league exceeded financial targets in its debut season, generating revenues of $8 million. The success of the league’s first season can be attributed in part to its novelty factor, but there is optimism that MLC will continue to grow in its second season both on and off the field. With momentum from a historic T20 World Cup and a strong fan base, MLC is poised for another successful season as it aims to establish itself as a premier T20 league in the world.",

    "body": "Salary caps will not increase, according to sources, but player wages will remain in the top echelons of T20 professional leagues as America's Major League Cricket unveiled an expanded schedule for its second season.\n\nThe six-team MLC made a historic debut last season as cricket continues a determined push into the world's biggest sports market. As I reported, the MLC exceeded financial targets with revenues of $8 million, but that has not led to an increase in salary caps, according to sources, for the upcoming season played in July.\n\nSalary caps for teams are set to remain the same, but top players will still be handsomely remunerated and earn $175,000 for a minimum of five games - rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nIt's led to many stars from major cricket nations lured to the U.S, including from powerhouse Australia who don't play international cricket in July unlike last year when they had an Ashes tour.\n\nLike last season, teams will be allowed six overseas players per starting eleven, according to sources, which is more than the quota of four accepted in established leagues.\n\nAmid an outcry, fearing the sanctity of international cricket, governing body the International Cricket Council tightened regulations last year with teams in official T20 leagues only allowed to field four overseas players.\n\nThe rule did not come into effect for the MLC or the well-heeled UAE league, but it is believed the MLC is targeting to comply with the ICC regulations in the coming seasons.\n\nThe upcoming MLC season was officially unveiled on Tuesday and will run from July 5-28, with the pointy end of its season set to clash with the Hundred, the 100-ball competition in England.\n\nThe American tournament will expand by six games with teams to play seven matches in the group stages ahead of the four playoff games concluding with the final on July 28. MLC officials and owners want a home-and-away season - where the teams play each other twice - to underpin the competition, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds.\n\nLike last year, the entire tournament will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina. There had been hope that New York's modular stadium being built for June's T20 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S. - costing $30 million as I reported last month - could host games in the MLC.\n\nBut that won't ensue with an unknown over the ground at Nassau County Stadium in Eisenhower Park, 30 miles east of Manhattan, after the T20 World Cup.\n\nAccording to sources, the MLC hopes to carve out space in the calendar from mid-June to mid-July to avoid schedule clashes with the Hundred. But that was not possible this season due to the T20 World Cup finishing on June 29.\n\nThe MLC's season opener will be a blockbuster between defending champions MI New York and Seattle Orcas at Morrisville in a rematch of last season's final.",

    "title": "Major League Cricket’s expansion plan poses a threat to English competitions",
    "date": "Mon May 27 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the US. In a move that will have significant implications for the landscape of the professional sport in England, MLC, which began with a 19-game season, has confirmed it will expand to 34 games by 2025.\n\nThe US league now has six franchises but plans to launch two more in the near future, and two more soon after that. The announcement comes just after MLC has been fully legitimised by the news that its matches have been awarded List A status by the International Cricket Council.\n\n“It was always intended to be a 10‑team league,” the MLC chief exe­cutive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the ­Guardian. “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nThe second season, which starts at the end of the men’s T20 World Cup, runs for 23 days and overlaps with the Hundred. The US tournament next year will be significantly longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC is keen to play in June.\n\n“Ultimately for us our ideal calen­dar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,” Srinivasan said. The tournament was pushed back this year because of the T20 World Cup, which is using the MLC’s stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas. “With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nThat would clash with the T20 Blast season but leave the Hundred to run from late July through August.\n\nEnglish cricket has already had to adapt to sharing its summer with a competing league. Last year Jason Roy gave up his England contract so he could take a job with LA Knight Riders, while Surrey’s Sunil Narine skipped the county side’s appearance on Blast finals day because he was also playing for LA. Alec Stewart, Surrey’s director of cricket, said at the time it was “disappointing and frustrating” to “lose a player of ­Narine’s quality at late notice”. Narine’s ­decision was a sobering reminder of the status of English domestic cricket.\n\nMLC’s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed that it was the “direction of travel” for the game on 10 May, but there is frustration about slow progress. MLC boasts a formidable array of investors, including four IPL sides – Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals – as well as significant business figures such as Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella.\n\n“All of these people who came on board with us when we started five years ago have been immensely successful in other walks of life,” Srinivasan said. “You know they understand that this is not one of those things where you can just turn a switch. The expectation was never that this would be an overnight transition. They’ve been immensely patient and they’ve backed us all the way through.”\n\nMLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local ­players. It is now working on ­developing more List A venues. “We’re not here to play a league and go away every year,” Srinivasan said.\n\n“We feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think 10 years from now, I think you’ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we’ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.”",

The second edition of the competition is going to take place right after the T20 World Cup, scheduled to be played in the Caribbeans and the United States of America in June 2024.\n\nMLC 2024 is scheduled to start on July 4, five days after the final of the T20 World Cup. Several players, who will be playing in the World Cup, will be joining their franchises for the tournament. According to a report in ESPNcricinfo, big names such as Rashid Khan, Heinrich Klaasen, Trent Boult, and Haris Rauf have been retained by their respective teams.\n\nBig names retained for MLC 2024:\n\nThe report further stated that a total of 23 overseas players have been retained by the franchises for the highly-awaited second edition of the MLC. Reigning champions MI New York have retained seven overseas players including West Indies star Nicholas Pooran who scored a blazing century in the final last year. The other notable names retained by the franchise are Kieron Pollard, Dewald Brevis, Kagiso Rabada, Boult, Rashid and Tim David.\n\nMost of the players retained by the New York-based franchise are set to ply their trade in the T20 World Cup. South Africa star Klaasen will be plying his trade for Seattle Orcas once again. He will have the company of his compatriots Wayne Parnell and Quinton de Kock on the team. The Orcas have also retained Pakistan allrounder Imad Wasim.\n\nLA Knight Riders have retained Jason Roy, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Adam Zampa, and Spencer Johnson. Texas Super Kings will continue to avail the services of Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway, and Mitchell Santner. On the other hand, Washington Freedom, who recently appointed Ricky Ponting as their head coach, has retained just two overseas players – Akeal Hosein and Marco Jansen.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have also retained just two players – Rauf and Finn Allen. The franchises will now be looking to sign overseas players to complete their squads. The franchise is permitted to sign a maximum of nine overseas players.",

    "date": "Tue Feb 21 11:45:08 2023",
    "body": "After holding private discussions with the executives of a new American T20 league, Steve Smith is supposedly in with a possibility of playing cricket in the United States the next year.\n\nThis year’s Major League Cricket competition begins in July and will last three weeks while being contested in Texas and North Carolina. Rich Indian businesspeople and celebrities have contributed more than AU$174 million to the six-team competition, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nardella and Bollywood icon Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nIPL 2023 | Australia tour of India 2023 | Dream11 Prediction | Fantasy Cricket Tips | Cricket Match Prediction Today | Cricket News | Cricket Live Score\n\nMight See A Lot Of Steve Smith In The USA: MLC Co-founder Sameer Mehta\n\nThere is a $1.5 million pay ceiling for each of the six franchises, which are located in Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Seattle, and New York City. Each franchise may sign up to seven international talents. Last week, Cricket NSW established a strategic alliance with MLC that would let American players compete in the American T20 event and Australian players play in NSW Premier Cricket.\n\nNew South Wales is anticipated to provide players and personnel for the squad as part of CNSW’s high-performance collaboration with the Washington DC franchise.\n\nIPL 2023 | India National Cricket Team | IND vs AUS 2023 | India vs Australia 2023\n\n“With the global cricket landscape currently undergoing significant transition, we view the United States as a market with immense growth potential,” CNSW chief executive Lee Germon said in a statement.\n\n“Cricket NSW’s track record in high performance cricket and elite match operations is second to none and we believe we can bring a raft of experience to MLC and the Washington D.C. franchise in the coming years.”\n\nSteve Smith, who has made New York his second home, won’t be able to participate in the MLC tournament this year because it conflicts with the Ashes, according to News Corp, but the 33-year-old has reportedly been in contact with the competition’s organizers about a 2024 participation.\n\nIn June of next year, when the Men’s T20 World Cup is set to begin in the United States and the West Indies, Steve Smith may find himself without a job.\n\n“We’ve been in touch with Steve about his plans and what he’s thinking,” MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta told News Corp.\n\n“What he’d love to do at some point is play cricket in the US as his schedule permits.\n\n“His view was that if he could make it work and if we could make it work – I know this season, he has commitments. I don’t know what the Australian calendar is next year but I believe there is enough space for him to potentially play.”\n\n“Long-term … our view is that we might see a lot of him in the US.”\n\nSteve Smith Interested About Cricket In USA\n\nWhen asked about finishing his career as a player in the United States, where he and his wife Dani announced their engagement in 2017, sTEVE Smith commented earlier this summer that it would be “quite great.”\n\n“There’s obviously leagues popping up everywhere around the world now, and I think you’ll probably see more players in the back end of their career going down that route, so it’s potentially something I’ll look at in the future,” Steve Smith told the Sydney Morning Herald in September.\n\n“The US has been a market that cricket’s been trying to get into for some time. So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nA rising market for cricket has been identified as the United States, where a sizable South Asian diaspora and the country’s financial clout are accelerating the growth of the game.\n\nOn July 13 in Texas, the MLC’s inaugural season is scheduled to start.",

    "body": "Anticipation is building for the second season of Major League Cricket as the lucrative American professional T20 competition aims to build on a successful debut.\n\nThe upcoming season starts on July 5 with a double header between defending champions MI New York and Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season's final at Morrisville, North Carolina, while Texas Super Kings plays LA Knight Riders in the later fixture in Dallas.\n\nThe final will be played on July 27, with the latter parts of the tournament clashing with the Hundred, the high-profile 100-ball competition in England.\n\nAs I reported recently, MLC officials want the tournament to be held annually from mid-June to mid-July to avoid clashes, but this year was not possible due to the T20 World Cup - co-hosted by the U.S - only finishing in late June.\n\nThe MLC hierarchy are bullish that momentum from a historic T20 World Cup, with games played in New York, Dallas and Florida, can spill over after pre-sale tickets have been in \"high demand\" since the season's schedule was unveiled.\n\nStandard tickets start at $30. “The enthusiasm for cricket in America is increasing rapidly, and we are delighted to provide fans across the nation the opportunity to witness top-tier cricket live in their own backyard,\" MLC chief executive Vijay Srinivasan said.\n\n\"The success of the first season has given us a foundation to establish one of the premier T20 leagues in the world.\n\n\"Our goal is to keep expanding the sport in the United States and offer the community an opportunity to engage with it, whether as fans or participants.\"\n\nAttendances last season were strong with around 70,000 fans turning out to the 18-day tournament played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the more modest Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nThe second season will expand by six games with teams to play seven matches in the group stages ahead of four playoff games. MLC officials and owners want a home-and-away season - where the teams play each other twice - to underpin the competition, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds.\n\nAs I reported previously, salary caps will not increase but player wages will remain in the top echelons of T20 professional leagues. Top players will still be well remunerated and earn $175,000 for a minimum of five games - rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nMLC has benefited from powerhouse Australia having no international commitments after the T20 World Cup. It has led to a barrage of marquee Australian signings, including legendary Steve Smith, emerging star batter Jake Fraser-McGurk and last year's World Cup heroes Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head.\n\nAs I first reported, MLC exceeded financial targets in its debut season with revenues of $8 million.\n\nUndoubtedly the novelty factor helped its long-awaited launch. But, as excitement continues to build, there is growing optimism that MLC will be even more successful on-and-off the field in its second season.",

LAKR made the move official on their social media platforms on May 30, Thursday. Miller's move to the Los Angeles-based franchise comes days after they had brought in veteran Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan to the team.\n\nMiller had a hot and cold IPL 2024 campaign with GT this year as the former champions had a season to forget. Miller's time with the team was marred by injuries as he missed a lot of crucial matches and wasn't in the best form after his injury.\n\nMiller scored just 210 runs in 9 matches for Gujarat at an average of 35 with one fifty to his name. GT would end up missing out on reaching the Playoffs this season and finished 8th in the table.\n\nLAKR's squad so far\n\nAhead of the new season of MLC, LAKR have made some big moves as they look to reach the Playoffs. The Los Angeles-based side had already retained the likes of Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Spencer Johnson and Adam Zampa.\n\nFrom the domestic side of things, Saif Badar, Unmukt Chand, Ali Khan, Nitish Kumar and Shadley Van Schalkwyk were retained. Ali Khan has been a fixture of the Knight Riders franchise and plays for them in the CPL with the Trinbago Knight Riders.\n\nChand returns to LAKR after missing out on selection to the USA squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup.\n\nDuring the domestic draft, LAKR added Adithya Ganesh, Corné Dry, Derone Davis and Matthew Tromp to the team.

The hard-hitting left-hander joins the Knights after a good season with Texas Super Kings in the 2023 edition.\n\nIn the opening match of the 2023 season, Miller's fifty helped set up a 69-run win for the Super Kings over the Knight Riders. The 34-year-old has scored over 10,000 runs in his illustrious T20 career, with a blistering strike rate of 138.37.\n\nAdding Miller to the batting order for the Knight Riders was a no-brainer after they finished dead last in 2023 with just a single win. His ability to clear the ropes and dominate in the death overs could be the difference maker in this season.\n\nMiller joins a core of retained international players that includes Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Adam Zampa, and Spencer Johnson.

    "body": "by Smit Patel • Published on\n\nMLC will be recognised as official List A cricket from the second season onwards © MLC\n\nUSA's flagship T20 tournament, Major League Cricket (MLC) is eyeing a possible expansion to 10 teams. The MLC announced it will be expanding to an 8 team tournament within the space of two seasons and add two more to make it a 10 team franchise tournament eventually. The first season was played out in a single round robin format within 6 teams consisting of 19 games in a 3 week window.\n\nWhile the second season will see an increase of 6 games, the league is further expected to grow with a home and away format in the future. In a 10 team league, the actual number of games are set to spike up to close to 100 games.\n\nIn a major shot in the arm for the MLC, the ICC put its weight behind this $120m fledgling league by imparting a List A status to its games. Inherently, all domestic T20 games in associate nations are left bereft of the List A status but ICC's approval for the List A status is an endorsement of the quality of cricket at display at the inaugural season of the MLC.\n\n\"We saw cricket mania sweep across the US last year off the back of our inaugural season of Major League Cricket. Now, we take exciting momentum into the highly anticipated ICC T20 World Cup and season two of the MLC\" said Vijay Srinivasan CEO of MLC\n\n\"With an unforgettable summer of cricket on our doorstep, we're ready to capture the hearts of American sports fans with our thrilling, adrenaline-charged game that is the most exciting emerging T20 tournament across the globe\" added Srinivasan.\n\nThe prospects of MLC propelling itself to be a 10 team tournament is seen as a bit unsettling to the English game. In its full glory MLC, may ultimately carve out a 10 week window for itself to accommodate the home and away format for all of its 10 teams. As it stands, the MLC is well placed in a buffer between the IPL and the Hundred in the cricket calendar. With American and English summers overlapping, there is a high chance the MLC and competitions like the Blast and Hundred duel it out to attract and reserve top talent within their windows.\n\nMeanwhile, the American cricketing juggernaut has rolled along quietly on and off the field. The success of the inaugural season of the MLC has stimulated sponsorship from industry leaders like Cognizant and Stake. It is understood that the title sponsor Cognizant has pledged in close to $2m for the upcoming season. Furthermore, the USA men's historic series win over Bangladesh in the build up to their first world cup augurs well for American cricket, which finds itself in the midst of a T20 revolution.\n\n© Cricbuzz",

    "body": "Women's cricket could soon have a potential women's T20 franchise tournament in the United States. While still in the early stages, influential stakeholders in American cricket seem keen to capitalize on the unique window of opportunity presented. This is due to the country's hosting of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the recent success of the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) men's T20 tournament.\n\nWith cricket set to make its Olympic debut in 2028 and the USA women's national team likely to qualify as hosts, there is a growing realization of the need to develop the women's game domestically. The remarkable rise of the Women's Premier League (WPL) in India, where stars worldwide earned good salaries, has further highlighted the commercial potential of women's T20 cricket.\n\nWhile the project is still in the talking stage, the proposed tournament would aim to attract the world's best players and potentially operate alongside the existing men's franchises in the MLC.\n\nSeveral MLC franchise owners, including the Ambani family that owns MI New York, have expressed interest in developing women's teams. This move could significantly boost the profile and earning potential of women's cricketers globally.\n\nAlso read: Threat looms over marquee event as weather destroys facilities to cancel USA-Bangladesh warm up fixture\n\nUSA to host its first ICC event\n\nIf the plans materialize, it could have far-reaching implications for the international commitments of England's women cricketers and their participation in domestic tournaments like The Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has already taken steps to increase earnings for its domestic women's players, but compared to the offers in the WPL, there is still less.\n\nLaunching a women's T20 franchise league in the USA would mark a significant milestone for the game. It would provide a platform for the world's best talent to showcase their skills and potentially inspire a new generation of American women cricketers.\n\nAlso read: Stuart Law opens up on USA's historic series win over Bangladesh\n\nIn the past few years, USA Cricket has pushed the ranks and established itself in cricket.

    "body": "Six-team MLC to initially grow to eight franchises before adding two more\n\nCompetition awarded List A status by ICC\n\nJune start would mean clash with England’s T20 Blast\n\nUS Twenty20 competition Major League Cricket (MLC) plans to expand to ten teams as part of efforts to grow the sport in the country.\n\nThe six-team tournament will hold its second season from 5th to 28th July, which will see half a dozen more matches played compared to the 19 for the inaugural campaign in 2023. The US is also preparing to co-host the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup alongside the West Indies, with games to be played in Florida, New York and Texas.\n\nMLC currently has franchises based in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Washington, but intends to add two new teams in the near future and two more soon after that.\n\n“It was always intended to be a ten‑team league,” MLC chief exe­cutive Vijay Srinivasan told The Guardian. “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support team teams, so that’s our plan.\n\n“We had 19 games in our first season, [we] will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nSrinivasan added that the league was eager to play in June and have that month as its permanent calendar spot.\n\n“Ultimately for us our ideal calen­dar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,” he said. “The tournament was pushed back this year because of the T20 World Cup, which is using the MLC’s stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\n“With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nThe announcement arrives shortly after the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarded MLC matches with List A status – one of the three major forms of cricket recognised by the game’s global governing body. It sees MLC become the second associate-nation-run T20 tournament to attain List A status, following the International League T20 (ILT20) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nAs well as aiming to make MLC one of cricket’s top domestic T20 leagues, perhaps even second only to the Indian Premier League (IPL), organisers have established academies and a minor league system to develop local players. They are also working on building more List A venues, including grounds for MLC teams.\n\n“We’re not here to play a league and go away every year,” said Srinivasan.\n\n“We feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think ten years from now, I think you’ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we’ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.”\n\nSportsPro says…\n\nIf MLC is a success, it has the potential to alter the economics of cricket – a sport where India remains far and away its most lucrative market.\n\nHowever, another domestic T20 league poses a headache for rival competitions, notably in England. This year’s MLC season, which starts less than a week after the Men’s T20 World Cup concludes, will partly overlap with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s (ECB) The Hundred, which takes place from 23rd July to 18th August.\n\nA June start from 2025 for MLC would mean The Hundred could run unopposed but would result in a clash with the T20 Blast, another English domestic competition, and put counties at risk of losing players to MLC. This year’s T20 Blast is pencilled in from 30th May to 14th September.\n\nThe arrival of MLC has also led to further pressure for a decision on allowing private investment into The Hundred to help it compete with rival franchise competitions. This is partly due to MLC’s enviable set of investors, with four of its teams controlled by IPL franchise owners – the Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals, Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella also co-owns the Seattle Orcas.\n\nIn April, the ECB revealed it had begun the process of securing private investment in The Hundred. The national governing body, along with England’s 18 first-class counties and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), agreed earlier this month that external funding was the “direction of travel” for the English game but there is frustration about the slow progress.\n\nMLC and the wider growth of cricket in the US are key priorities for the ICC. However, the league’s emergence has left other competitions, aside from the IPL, wary as they seek to retain market share.\n\nGet your daily briefing of all the essential news across the sports industry with the SportsPro Daily Newsletter.

    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC), the young American T20 league, has secured a significant milestone with the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarding it List A status. This recognition elevates the MLC to the status of an official T20 league, with player performances now holding official weight in their career statistics.\n\nList A Status: Recognition and Opportunity\n\n“We are really excited for the news as it’s a recognition of the standard and high quality of players taking part in the tournament,” said MLC tournament director Justin Geale. The List A status validates the MLC’s efforts in establishing a top-tier T20 competition in the USA. It also presents an opportunity to showcase American cricket on a global scale.\n\n“By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale,” Geale elaborated. More importantly, this recognition ensures that the achievements of players in the MLC will be reflected accurately in their official statistics.\n\nExpansion Plans and Scheduling Ambitions\n\nBuilding on this momentum, the MLC has ambitious plans for expansion. The league currently features six teams, but according to MLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan, this will grow to ten teams over the next few years. This expansion will be accompanied by an increase in matches, from 19 in 2023 to 34 by 2025.\n\nSrinivasan also revealed the league’s ideal calendar window. He envisions an early June start, coinciding with the conclusion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the beginning of US school holidays. This timeframe would allow the MLC to establish its own window without directly conflicting with the Hundred, a rival T20 league played in England and Wales.\n\nPotential Scheduling Conflicts and Overlap with the Hundred\n\nHowever, the MLC’s desired June start might create some overlap with the English T20 Blast competition. A similar scheduling conflict arose last year when England’s Jason Roy opted to play in the MLC instead of fulfilling his contract with the ECB. This situation highlights the complexities of scheduling multiple T20 leagues across the globe.\n\nThe upcoming season will see a six-day overlap with the Hundred, with the MLC concluding on July 28th and the Hundred starting on July 23rd. This overlap could potentially impact the availability of overseas players who might be participating in both leagues. Significantly, twelve out of the twenty-four overseas players currently contracted with the Hundred have already played or are signed up to play in the MLC.\n\nStrong Foundation with IPL Backing\n\nFour of the six MLC franchises are owned by established IPL teams – Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals. This strong backing from experienced IPL ownership groups provides the MLC with a solid foundation for growth and development.\n\nThe inaugural MLC season, held in July 2023, saw MI New York emerge victorious under the captaincy of Nicholas Pooran. The upcoming season will be played across the same two venues as the first – Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.\n\nWith List A status and ambitious expansion plans, Major League Cricket is poised to play a significant role in the development of American cricket. The coming season promises exciting competition and strategic manoeuvring as the MLC carves its own niche in the ever-evolving T20 landscape.",

    "date": "Mon May 27 12:49:30 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the US. In a move that will have significant implications for the landscape of professional sport in England, MLC, which started with a 19-match season, has confirmed it will expand to 34 matches by 2025. The league currently includes six franchises, but plans to have two more in the near future, and two more soon after. The announcement comes just after MLC was fully legitimized by the news that its matches have been granted List A status by the International Cricket Council.\n\n“It was always intended to be a 10-team league,” MLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan told The Guardian. “Research shows that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support ten teams, so that is our plan. We had 19 games in our first season and will have 25 in our second. I think we want to go to 34 next year and just gradually expand further.” The second season, which starts at the end of the World T20, lasts 23 days and overlaps with the Hundred. Next year’s edition will last considerably longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC would like to play in June.\n\n“Ultimately, our ideal calendar for us is to start much earlier, in late spring or early summer,” Srinivasan said. The tournament was postponed this year due to the Men’s T20 World Cup, which uses the MLC Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas. “With the Indian Premier League ending at the end of May, I think our best bet would be to start in early June, when we have the school holidays in the US, and then start in July. This is how we would like to decorate our shop window.” That would clash with the T20 Blast season, but the Hundred would run from late July to August.\n\nEnglish cricket has already had to adapt to sharing the summer with a rival league. Last year, Jason Roy gave up his England contract so he could take a job with the LA Knight Riders, while Surrey’s Sunil Narine skipped Surrey’s appearance on Blast final day as he also played for LA. Surrey’s director of cricket, Alec Stewart, said at the time that it was “disappointing and frustrating” to “lose a player of Narine’s quality late on”. Narine’s decision was a sobering reminder of the status of English domestic cricket.\n\nThe MLC’s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed this was the “direction of travel” for the match on May 10, but there is frustration at the slow progress. MLC boasts a formidable array of investors, including four IPL sides – the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Mumbai Indians, the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi Capitals – as well as key business people such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n“All these people who came to us when we started five years ago have been hugely successful in other walks of life,” Srinivasan said. switch. The expectation was never that this would be an overnight transition. They have been extremely patient and supported us all the way.” MLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local players. Work is now underway to develop more List A sites.\n\n“We are not here to play a league and go away every year,” Srinivasan added. “We feel like our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think in ten years you will see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of locations across the country, we’ll have a sort of home and away format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger player pool in the system as a result. Hopefully this means we’ll have a very strong kind of American team as well. Those are all our ambitions.”",
    "summary": "**Expansion Plans:** MLC has announced plans to expand from a 19-match season to 34 matches by 2025, with the ultimate goal of becoming a 10-team league.

The MLC competition also features teams representing Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Texas, with players including West Indians Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell, Kiwi Trent Boult and Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan.\n\nPonting’s former teammate Shane Watson coaches the San Francisco Unicorns in the competition.\n\nMLC chief executive Vijay Srinivasan said the participation of players the calibre of Smith, Maxwell and Head would help the sport grow in the US, with the organisation hoping to invest in further cricket infrastructure across America.\n\n“This promises to be our most thrilling season yet, with each of the MLC’s six teams actively recruiting in the off-season, adding a host of world-class player signings to their team rosters with more big names to be soon announced,” he said.\n\n“Last year, we unveiled MLC at the newly upgraded Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, and the brand new Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, which will both once again co-host the 2024 tournament, building on the impact of season one in those communities.\n\n“These venues will deliver world-class pitches and a vibrant atmosphere to support the overall MLC fan experience. Moreover, we are committed to exploring expansion opportunities with new cricket venues to support our six teams’ growing American fanbase.”",

    "date": "Thu Feb  1 03:23:52 2024",
    "body": "Ricky Ponting has forged a reputation as one of the most astute minds in world cricket and now the Aussie legend could be taking that knowledge with him to the United States. The former Aussie captain has confirmed he is in talks to coach the Washington Freedom in America's Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nThe United States launched its first major foray into the world of cricket with the introduction of the MLC in 2023 - a T20 competition comprised of six teams from a number of America's biggest cities. MI New York were crowned inaugural champions after defeating the Seattle Orcas in the championship final, with the majority of the matches played in front of sold-out stadiums in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nOH NO: Will Pucovski ruled out of Sheffield Shield game amid fresh blow\n\nBRUTAL: Michael Clarke mocked in savage moment at Aussie cricket awards\n\nNOT GOOD: Ellyse Perry and Nathan Lyon dudded amid Mitch Marsh triumph\n\nThe US-based competition is part of the ICC's push for cricket's expansion into the lucrative North American market, and Ponting's inclusion would be a massive boon for both the MLC and the sport. The legendary former Australian captain is deciding whether he can commit to both the MLC and commentary duties for the T20 World Cup, which will be held in North America in June.\n\nRicky Ponting confirms talks with Washington Freedom\n\nThe second edition of MLC will begin just four days after the World Cup final is played in Barbados on June 30. \"We're not there yet, I haven't committed to anything just yet, but I've had some initial discussions (with Washington),\" Ponting told SEN radio on Thursday.\n\n\"The time of the year sort of fits in OK for me, but I've got a really hectic off-season again. When I say off-season, there's no such thing as an off-season for cricketers anymore.\"\n\nPonting is currently head coach of the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the head of strategy for Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League (BBL) and one of the chief commentators on the Seven Network's free-to-air cricket coverage in Australia. \"It's potentially another big year of time away if I want it, so there are things I've got to work through,\" Ponting said. \"If I'm actually going to be commentating the T20 World Cup or not and if I'm not doing that, where does MLC fit in?\"\n\nPonting would be a tremendous addition to a Washington Freedom side that made it to the MLC eliminator final last year, with his knowledge of the game and tactical awareness among the best in the sport. Not to mention the commercial and public relations possibilities that come with having one of the game's greatest ever players attached to the competition.\n\nIndia's influence in the fledgling US-based competition is evidenced by the fact three out of the six teams share part of their names with IPL franchises. Aussie states have also shown a willingness to form strategic partnerships with the US teams, with Cricket Victoria aligning itself with the San Francisco Unicorns and Queensland Cricket announcing a collaboration with the Seattle Orcas.\n\nCricket NSW also share a partnership with the Washington Freedom, with Greg Shipperd central to the relationship between the two parties. The Aussie coach led the Washington side in its inaugural season and recently took over as the NSW state coach, having managed the Sydney Sixers since 2015 in the BBL.\n\nIf Ponting is named as Shipperd's successor at Washington, he would become the latest big name in Aussie cricket to join the MLC. Aussie ODI World Cup winners Marcus Stoinis and Adam Zampa, as well as white-ball stars Matthew Wade and Aaron Finch were all part of the MLC's inaugural season.\n\nRicky Ponting's cricket brain continues to amaze\n\nWashington would no doubt be hoping that Ponting could bring some of the cricketing genius that he continues to showcase in his commentary role for Seven. Ponting's commentary predictions have become legendary in recent years, with the 168-Test legend showing why he's regarded as the smartest man in cricket during Australia's Test series against the West Indies.\n\nPonting successfully called Alex Carey's downfall on day two of the Windies' historic Gabba Test win in Brisbane. It came as Usman Khawaja and Carey were left to try and rescue Australia's innings after a top order collapse against the underdogs. Khawaja and Carey combined for a 65-run partnership to steady the ship for Australia, but Ponting noticed Carey was starting to become frustrated with his own scoring rate.\n\n\"It looks like his eyes are spinning. He is in overdrive and wants to hit every ball,\" Ponting said. \"I agree with you Bish (West Indies great Ian Bishop), just go a bit more defensive and make him play a big shot from a good length ball.\" As Ponting finished his tactical analysis, Shamar Joseph charged in and delivered a ball at Carey's chest.\n\nCarey mistimed a pull shot and the ball went directly to the West Indies fielder. Once again Ponting had a premonition about a wicket after also displaying his clairvoyant powers 24 hours earlier. On that occasion, Ponting suggested the West Indies batting duo should rotate the strike at the end of day one or risk losing a late wicket.\n\nThat same over, Alzarri Joseph was dismissed on the final ball of the day after Kevin Sinclair had refused a single. The two examples were just the latest in a growing list of brilliant calls from Ponting, whose ability to predict what's about to happen in a cricket match is becoming legendary.",

Jolly shame!\"\n\nWhile other cricketers in the league have also expressed concerns over having to \"rush the game,\" preliminary polls of the three or four people who actually watch cricket have shown that the change is quite popular.\n\n\"It makes it much easier to watch cricket now that I don't have to take two weeks' vacation every time I want to catch a game,\" said Robert Brown, avid fan of the New Delhi BumblyBowlers. \"I have so much more time now to do other things, like eat and see my family. It was sorely needed.\"\n\nAt publishing time, the innovation had succeeded in bringing the length of MLC cricket matches down to a record 7 days, 4 hours, and 37 minutes.\n\nWant proof that Jesus was a woke socialist?

    "date": "Fri Jul 12 02:31:00 2024",
    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nAfter finishing rock-bottom of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in 2023, the Los Angeles Knight Riders began this season well with a victory but now come into this one on the back of back-to-back defeats. The San Francisco Unicorns have picked up one win with one defeat in their opening two matches ahead of this clash in North Carolina.\n\nDATE & TIME: Saturday 13th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:00pm / USA PT – 12:00pm / West Indies – 2:00pm / UK – 8:00pm / South Africa – 9:00pm / Sunday 14th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:00am / India – 12:30am / Bangladesh – 1:00am / Australia – 5:00am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 32c o 89.6 F with rain forecast at the start of the match\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: THE SHODDY LAKR\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders began the 2024 Major League Cricket season with an impressive defence of what seemed to be a fairly small total when the Texas Super Kings fell 12 runs short of LAKR’s 162-7. Since then, though, they could not defend 165-6 against the San Francisco Unicorns and then also suffered a nine-wicket thumping to last season’s runners’ up, the Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWL\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: BOUNCING BACK\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns began their season with that aforementioned victory over LAKR in Dallas. Finn Allen led the way with 63 runs from 37 balls as they reached 166-4 in just 15.2 overs last week. In their second match of the tournament, they were skittled for just 127 by an experienced Texas Super Kings side before giving up the target in just 12.5 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: LWLLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nEven in victory, the Los Angeles Knight Riders simply haven’t scored enough runs. 162 shouldn’t have been enough to beat TSK and the two targets they have set since have been well below par. What did happen in their second game, though, was South African David Miller coming to the party with an unbeaten 44 at a strike rate of 200 and the thrilling middle-order bat is likely to be their top scorer if their misfiring top order get out early enough.\n\nWith the ball, they have a fair bit of variation with the likes of Ali Khan, Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan and Sunil Narine. However, they are heavily reliant on Aussie quick Spencer Johnson for wickets. The Unicorns go hard and should lose wickets so Johnson to take two or more poles would appear a good bet for that reason.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWith a top order that consists of the aforementioned Finn Allen as well as Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Short and Josh Inglis; the San Francisco Unicorns have the potential to do exactly what they have shown in their opening two matches; collapse in a heap or go hard and get a big score in no time. Short is the man in the best nick at the moment so him to score 30+ at another decent strike rate would be a worthy shout.\n\nIn the bowling department, the Unicorns have the experience of former England international Liam Plunkett but beyond that they are perhaps a bit blunt for the shortest format of the game with the consistently flattering to deceive Haris Rauf and more suited to Test match bowling of Abrar Ahmed. Plunkett remains their best chance of wickets outside of the powerplay so Plunkett to be their top bowler remains the best bet for this.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThis is a confusing one to predict a winner in because of the strengths and weakness of both sides. LAKR have the edge with the ball, whilst the Unicorns are certainly the more modern day and aggressive of the two sides with the bat. That said, if the top four of San Francisco, albeit Inglis dropped to five against TSK, can fire then they can easily overwhelm any team in the competition – and LAKR’s best bet, of experience with the ball, is still relatively weak. As a result, the Unicorns will be confident of doing the double over their opposition.",
    "summary": "**Match Details**\n\n* Date: Saturday, July 13, 2024 (with varying start times depending on the region)\n* Venue: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n* Teams: Los Angeles Knight Riders vs San Francisco Unicorns\n\n**Team Forms**\n\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders: Began the season with a win, but lost their next two matches, including a 9-wicket defeat to the Seattle Orcas. Their last three matches are LLWWL.\n* San Francisco Unicorns: Won their first match against Los Angeles Knight Riders, but lost their second match to the Texas Super Kings. Their last three matches are LWLLW.\n\n**Key Players**\n\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders: David Miller, Ali Khan, Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan, Sunil Narine, and Spencer Johnson\n* San Francisco Unicorns: Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Short, Josh Inglis, and Liam Plunkett\n\n**Prediction**\n\n* The match is difficult to predict due to the strengths and weaknesses of both teams. The San Francisco Unicorns are more aggressive with the bat, while the Los Angeles Knight Riders have an edge with the ball. The Unicorns are confident of doing the double over their opposition if their top four batsmen can fire.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom beat Seattle Orcas by 5 wickets, in Match 8 of the Major League Cricket 2024, at Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas today.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom, Match 8\n\nSeattle Orcas 124/10 (19.4 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom 127/5 (18.2 ov)\n\nResult - Washington Freedom won by 5 wickets\n\nSCORECARD\n\nManhattan\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nWashington Freedom edged out Seattle Orcas by five wickets in a tense low-scoring match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas on Thursday.\n\nLockie Ferguson (4/26) and Saurabh Netravalkar (3/18) shared seven wickets to bundle out Seattle Orcas to 124 in 19.4 overs. Lahiru Milantha (33 off 30) and Obus Pienaar (25 off 28) then anchored a crucial unbeaten 63-run partnership to guide Washington Freedom past their 125-run target with 10 balls to spare.\n\nWith this win, Washington Freedom moved to the top of the points table with 5 points from three matches, remaining the only unbeaten team in the tournament thus far.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas came out firing to defend a low total of 125 runs. Imad Wasim removed the dangerous Travis Head for a duck on the second ball of the innings, ending the over with a wicket maiden. Steve Smith and Rachin Ravindra then looked to rebuild with the counter-attack. They scored as many as 18 runs in the third over. Ravindra looked dangerous with the bat, but Nandre Burger dismissed him in the fifth over for 26 off 16 balls, which included three boundaries and two sixes. Smith (12 off 13) followed him back to the pavilion in the following over, leaving the Orcas at 47/3 after six overs.\n\nBoth Mukhtar Ahmed and Glenn Maxwell were given lifelines with dropped catches but couldn't capitalise on them. Ahmed (8 off 8) was dismissed by Burger in the eighth over, and Maxwell (10 off 11) fell to Harmeet, leaving their team struggling at 68/5 after 10 overs.\n\nDespite the dire situation, Washington Freedom batters Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar showed resilience as they cautiously approached the target. They helped Washington reach the 100-run mark in the 16th over, reducing the equation to 23 runs needed off 24 balls. Milantha (33* off 30) and Pienaar (31* off 30) constructed a match-winning partnership to help their side get past the winning line.\n\nEarlier in the contest, the Seattle Orcas had a shaky start to their innings. Nauman Anwar was dismissed cheaply for 3 off 9 balls by Saurabh Netravalkar in the second over. The Seattle batters struggled to accelerate on the slow batting track, managing only 35 runs in the Powerplay. Ryan Rickelton also fell for 4 off 11 balls to Lockie Ferguson in the sixth over.\n\nQuinton de Kock (24 off 19) failed to build on his start and was bowled by Ferguson in the eighth over, with Seattle struggling at 44/3 after eight overs.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen and Shubham Ranjane carefully constructed a crucial partnership that steadied Seattle's innings. However, Ranjane (12 off 17) was unfortunately run out on the first ball of the 14th over. Klaasen, batting as if on a different surface, completed his fifty in just 29 balls but was immediately caught by Mukhtar Ahmed at long-off off Marco Jansen in the 15th over. His crucial innings, which included four fours and three sixes, helped Seattle cross the 100-run mark in the 15th over.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington bowlers didn't allow the following batters to score big. Ferguson took two wickets in the 17th over, finishing his spell with four wickets. He removed Imad Wasim (4 off 6) and Hammad Azam (4 off 9) in his last over. Netravalkar then dismissed Harmeet Singh (2 off 3) in the following over, leaving Seattle struggling at 112/8 after 18 overs.\n\nSeattle managed to get nine runs in the penultimate over as Cameron Gannon (8 off 5) attempted to hit the ball as hard as possible. He struck a maximum, but was dismissed on his second attempt, as he got caught by Ferguson at long-off off Ian Holland's bowling. Netravalkar then removed Nandre Burger (3 off 6), thus bowling out the Orcas for 124 in 19.4 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-6 (Nauman Anwar - 1.6 ov), 2-34 (Ryan Rickelton - 5.5 ov), 3-44 (Quinton de Kock - 7.5 ov), 4-81 (Shubham Ranjane - 13.1 ov), 5-102 (Heinrich Klaasen - 14.3 ov), 6-107 (Imad Wasim - 16.2 ov), 7-110 (Hammad Azam - 16.6 ov), 8-112 (Harmeet Singh - 17.3 ov), 9-120 (Cameron Gannon - 18.5 ov), 10-124 (Nandre Burger - 19.4 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-0 (Travis Head - 0.2 ov), 2-34 (Rachin Ravindra - 4.2 ov), 3-43 (Steven Smith - 5.5 ov), 4-53 (Mukhtar Ahmed - 6.5 ov), 5-64 (Glenn Maxwell - 9.1 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nRyan Rickelton\n\nNauman Anwar\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nHammad Azam\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nImad Wasim\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nNandre Burger\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nZaman Khan\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nTravis Head\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nLahiru Milantha(WK)\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nIan Holland\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Friday, July 12, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas",

The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the MI New York at Church Street Park in Morrisville. That game will be played on July 13th and will start at 12.30 am IST (7.00 pm GMT, the previous day). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nSteve Smith, the Washington Freedom skipper, says that it was a hard-fought game. Adds that the top order did not great start but Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar played smart cricket and got the job done. Shares that it was a slow and low wicket and all the bowlers did a good job. Mentions that they had a few hiccups with the bat but glad to be on the winning front. Reckons that the wicket got a tad slow so it was important to cash on the powerplay and would have been easy if someone from the top order had made a 50-60 but he's happy that the middle and lower order got their chance and they came out victorious.\n\nThe losing skipper of Seattle Orcas, Heinrich Klaasen says they lost the game in the last four overs with the bat as they couldn't add a lot to the total and left with a below-par score. Adds that they are lacking that one guy in the last few overs who could give them the perfect balance with both bat and ball to finish things well. Mentions that they needed to pick up wickets early on and they did that as well but they were good 15-20 runs shot at the end with the bat. Closes by saying the pitch was good and had they been at 140-145 by the end of their innings, the result could have been different.\n\nLockie Ferguson is the Player of the Match for his stellar spell. He says that it’s a good start to the campaign and nice to get in full 40 overs. Adds that as a group, it’s been great. Mentions that he tried bowling in good areas and it worked well for them. Ends by sharing that Heinrich Klaasen was looking dangerous and he's that they got his wicket.\n\nRachin Ravindra is up for a chat. He says it wasn't easy in the middle to bat but it was easier to bat while the ball was new. Adds that Imad Wasim bowled a maiden first up but him being a left-hander was a match-up for him and the support staff backed him for taking it on and it worked for him. Mentions that they look to stick to their plans and today despite the fall of wickets they kept playing their brand of cricket and eventually won.\n\nEarlier today, Seattle Orcas were asked to bat first and they made a below-par score of 124 with only Heinrich Klaasen making an attacking fifty while the rest of the batting struggled. Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar accounted for seven wickets between them and broke the back of Seattle Orcas' batting. Seattle Orcas are stranded at the bottom of the table while Washington Freedom moves to the top position. It's still early days in the season but teams will want to make winning a habit.\n\nSeattle Orcas did not have a huge score to defend but they started well by picking an early wicket. They gave away a few freebies through the powerplay but came back strong to put a dent in the Washington Freedom batting. Nandre Burger was the pick of the bowlers taking 2 for 26 while Harmeet Singh, Imad Wasim, and Cameron Gannon chipped in with one apiece and kept it tight. Seattle Orcas have suffered their second loss of the season and will want to turnaround their campaign quickly.\n\nA hard-fought run chase from the Washington Freedom takes them to the top of the table and they are unbeaten in the season so far. Chasing a tricky score of 125 for the win, the Freedom lost Travis Head for a duck but Smith and Ravindra stuck a few boundaries and got their side to a decent start in the powerplay. The Seattle Orcas came back strongly and reduced the Freedom to 64 for 5 with all their big guns back in the hut. Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar joined hands and added an unbeaten 63-run stand to steer their side home. Lahiru Milantha made a steady 33 off 30 while Obus Pienaar chipped in with 31 crucial runs. Washington Freedom are the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far and will hope to keep it going.\n\nStrategic Break! Washington Freedom needs 32 off the final five overs. They are ahead in the game but the Seattle Orcas are giving it a real fight. A couple of wickets here would tilt the tide in favor of the Orcas. Washington Freedom will hope for Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar to carry on and take their side home to get two more points on the board.",
    "summary": "The Washington Freedom cricket team has won their match against the Seattle Orcas, moving them to the top position in the tournament standings.

    "body": "Faf du Plessis in action for Texas Super Kings during MLC 2024 (X.com)\n\nFor the seventh fixture of the Major League Cricket 2024 season, San Francisco Unicorns will be pitted against Texas Super Kings on July 11, 12.00 AM IST at Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nWhile Texas is yet to taste victory, the Unicorns kicked off the tournament on the right note.\n\nSFU vs TEX: Team Previews\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns' tournament-opening game against the Los Angeles Knight Riders in Dallas turned out to be a dominant outing for the former. They bowled well to restrict LAKR to 165 runs total before Finn Allen went ballistic in the chase.\n\nHe scored 63 off 27 deliveries to ensure the Unicorns are off to a flyer start. Moreover, Matthew Short's fiery contribution of 58 (26) steered Unicorns to a successful run chase with four overs left.\n\nOverall, it was a complete performance from both the departments and hence ahead of the upcoming game against Texas, the Unicorns will count themselves as favourites.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nOn the other hand, Texas Super Kings are struggling to find their footing into the MLC 2024 edition. After losing a close game to LAKR in the tournament opener, Texas were saved by rain gods in the following game against Washington Freedom.\n\nSkipper Faf du Plessis' century resulted in 203 runs in the first innings total for Texas, and it appeared good enough until Travis Head and Steve Smith unleashed carnage in the powerplay.\n\nHead's 32 (12) and Smith's 26 (13) blistering knocks steered Washington to 64 runs on board in just the first four overs before rain interrupted play. Due to a weak drainage system, the game couldn't resume and both teams were awarded a point each.\n\nHowever, it's safe to say, had the game resumed, Washington would have walked all over Texas in no time. Hence, the Super Kings will remain under a lot of pressure against the Unicorns.\n\nSFU vs TEX: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSFU vs TEX: Church Street Park Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at Church Street Park generally provides a fair contest between bat and ball. However, this MLC 2024 season, the surface has favoured the batters to a larger extent. The powerplay period will be crucial for both sides and with the looming threat of rain, chasing is a good option.\n\nSFU vs TEX: Probable Playing XIs\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Finn Allen, Josh Inglis (wk), Matthew Short, Corey Anderson (c), Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Brody Couch, Hassan Khan, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed\n\nTexas Super Kings: Devon Conway (wk), Faf du Plessis (c), Aaron Hardie, Joshua Tromp, Marcus Stoinis, Milind Kumar, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, Mohammad Mohsin, Naveen-ul-Haq, Zia-ul-Haq\n\nSFU vs TEX: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nSFU vs TEX: Winner Prediction\n\nConsidering the tournament's trend and condition evaluation, the San Francisco Unicorns are expected to beat the Texas Super Kings in the upcoming matchup.",

Hence, Heinrich Klaasen and Co must stay vigilant and step up as a unit to advance against Washington.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nOn the other hand, Washington Freedom have been unlucky as their second game got washed out due to rain. Even in the tournament opener, they dodged a bullet with the results turning in their favour after the DLS method was enforced.\n\nChasing 155 runs against MI New York, Steve Smith stamped his authority with 46 off 28 runs knock, and before rain halted the game, Washington had 55 runs on board at the loss of one wicket. They were four runs ahead as per DLS calculations and were awarded two points for the game.\n\nWashington Freedom have potentially the most fierce and balanced unit at their helm this tournament. Travis Head and Smith are in the form of their lives whereas Glenn Maxwell, Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar have also raised the standards.\n\nHence, it's safe to say that Washington Freedom will be the team to beat this MLC 2024 edition.\n\nSEA vs WAS: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSEA vs WAS: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at Grand Prairie Stadium has offered even assistance to both the batting and bowling departments.

After winning their opening game over Texas Super Kings, the Sunil Narine-led side is on a two-match losing streak, suffering defeats against Unicorns and Seattle Orcas, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, Corey Anderson-led side is just below Knight Riders and holds the fifth position in the points table. The side started their campaign on a high note, registering a six-wicket win over the same opponents. But in their previous game against Super Kings, the San Francisco-based franchise faced a batting collapse which eventually resulted in them ending on the losing side.\n\nMatch Details\n\nPitch Report\n\nThe surface at Morrisville appears to be consistent, maintaining its characteristics for the full 20-over game. However, a notable issue is the decreasing strike rate of batters in the second innings, as the ball loses pace off the surface. This allows bowlers to exploit the inconsistent bounce, suggesting teams should set moderate, achievable targets rather than aiming for exceptionally high scores. However, the team that wins the toss will look to bowl first.\n\nHead-to-Head Record\n\nProbable Playing 11 for LAS vs SF, Match 10\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine(C), Unmukt Chand (WK), Shakib Al Hasan, Nitish Kumar, David Miller, Andre Russell, Derone Davis, Corne Dry, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short, Josh Inglis(WK), Corey Anderson(C), Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Hassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nAlso Check:\n\nProbable Top Performers from LAS vs SF\n\nProbable Best Batter of the match:\n\nJason Roy could be the best batter in the upcoming match against the San Francisco-based franchise. The English opener who is not a regular member of the Three Lions has been featuring in most of the franchise-based leagues all around the world. For San Francisco, Roy has been exceptional with his bat and has scored 97 runs in three innings. With his form, he can trouble the opposition bowlers and take his team to a comfortable position single-handedly.\n\nProbable Best Bowler of the match:\n\nSpencer Johnson could be the best bowler in the forthcoming game. The left-arm pacer has been among the wickets since the first game and is currently the second-highest wicket-taker with six wickets under his name. With the pitch favouring more to the bowlers, Johnson will be a key player.\n\nToday’s Match Prediction: The team that bowls first to win the match\n\nScenario 1\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 40-50\n\nFirst Innings Score: 140-150\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders win the match\n\nScenario 2\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 30-40\n\nFirst Innings Score: 130-140\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns win the match",

The ball travelled an astonishing 106 metres, leaving the crowd in awe and the San Francisco fielders in disbelief.\n\n“That six from Santner was an absolute beast,” commented one of the commentators. “He just got under that delivery and sent it into the stratosphere.

    "body": "Our Major League Cricket 2024 campaign starts with a mouth-watering clash against defending champions MI New York at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, on July 6.\n\nSteve Smith joins our side with a host of exciting players this season and will lead us in the second edition of MLC. Along with Smith, the Australian duo of Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell are also on board and will strengthen our batting.\n\nTravis Head had an excellent outing in the T20 World Cup 2024, finishing as the highest run-getter for Australia and the third-highest overall. The Southpaw amassed 255 runs from seven matches at an excellent average of 42.50 and a strike rate of 158.38.\n\nNew Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra and pacer Lockie Ferguson also join the team, alongside home favorites Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar who held fort from last year.\n\nGous and Netravalkar finished as the highest run-getter and wicket-taker respectively for the USA in the recently concluded T20 World Cup, powering the co-host to the Super 8 stage in their first-ever World Cup.\n\nRicky Ponting will be our Head Coach for the MLC 2024 season as he takes over the reins from last year’s coach Greg Shipperd. Ponting will be assisted by former Australian batter Cameron White.\n\nWhat went down for Washington Freedom in MLC 2023?\n\nWe finished third in the MLC 2023 standings with six points from three wins and two losses in our group games. In the resulting Eliminator contest against MI New York, we fell short by 16 runs.\n\nMatthew Short was our top run-getter in the 2023 campaign with 152 runs from six outings. Saurabh Netravalkar topped our bowling charts, ranking fifth overall with 10 wickets from six matches, including breathtaking figures of 6/9 against the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nMLC 2024 Schedule: Washington Freedom matches\n\nUnlike the five league matches, one against each team, which all teams had in MLC 2023, the current edition will see teams play a total of seven league matches. We will face MI New York and Texas Super Kings twice each and play once against the remaining three teams. Here's a look at our schedule for MLC 2024.\n\nWashington Freedom Matches at MLC 2024\n\nMLC 2024: Washington Freedom squad\n\nOur team has progressed well from last year and grown into a stronger unit in the second season. The batting group has a wealth of experience, especially with the Australian trio of Head, Maxwell, and Smith.\n\nMukhtar Ahmed is a dangerous batter at the top of the order, averaging 28.77 in T20s with a healthy strike rate of 146.18.\n\nLahiru Milantha is the second wicketkeeper in the squad, along with Andries Gous. The left-handed Milantha is also a useful batter, averaging just under 25 with a strike rate of 136.58.\n\nGlenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, Marco Jansen, and Ian Holland are the all-rounders who provide the much-needed balance to the side. Holland averages 27.55 with the bat in T20s, and his handy medium pace provides a breakthrough every 22.6 balls.\n\nNetravalkar and Ferguson spearhead a pace attack that includes the experienced Andrew Tye. Tye has a tally of 332 wickets from 239 matches at an average of 21.15 and an unbelievable strike rate of 15.4.\n\nAkeal Hosein will headline the spin department. He will be the fourth left-arm spinner in the side, along with Ravindra, Obus Pienaar, and Amila Aponso.\n\nWashington Freedom Squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy Bodugum, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs MINY MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nThe LIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs MI New York match will be available on Monumental Sports Network in Washington D.C. and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA.

    "body": "Lockie Ferguson's splendid spell with the ball powered Washington Freedom to a five-wicket win against Seattle Orcas in their Major League Cricket 2024 match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday.\n\nPlayer of the Match, Ferguson registered match-winning figures of 4/26 in four overs to skittle out SO for 124, while Saurabh Netravalkar also impressed, picking up three wickets. SO skipper Heinrich Klaasen top-scored in the contest with 51 off 30 balls.\n\nIn response, Lahiru Milantha played a sensible innings to anchor our chase with an unbeaten 30-ball 33, as we reached 127/5 with more than an over remaining. Obus Pienaar also chipped in with an unbeaten 31 off 30 balls.\n\nNetravalkar justified skipper Steve Smith’s decision to bowl first by striking in his first over. Ferguson picked up a wicket in the powerplay, as SO managed 35/2 after the first six overs, with only 16 runs coming from boundaries.\n\nWe kept things tight even after the powerplay with Ferguson knocking Quinton de Kock for his second wicket of the match. Smith was in action as he ran out Shubham Ranjane with an excellent fielding effort to break a crucial partnership.\n\nMarco Jansen dismissed dangerman Heinrich Klaasen, who had just reached his half-century and looked in fine touch. Ferguson returned for a double strike in his final over to end his spell with four scalps and Seattle Orcas were all-out with two balls to spare.\n\nNetravalkar rose to the top of the bowling charts of MLC 2024, picking up his eighth wicket of the tournament. The left-arm pacer finished with an incisive spell of 3/18.\n\nChasing 125, Rachin Ravindra, playing his first match in the MLC, got us off to a quick start, hitting 26 off just 16 balls, which included two sixes and three fours. We reached 47 for the loss of three wickets at the end of the powerplay.\n\nFrom 64/5, Milantha and Pienaar put their heads down to build a crucial partnership to wrest the initiative back from SO. Their unbroken sixth-wicket partnership of 63 runs from 55 balls helped us cross the line as we remained the only team to be unbeaten in the MLC this year.\n\nWith the win, we moved to the top of the MLC 2024 points table with five points from three matches.\n\nWe will meet the Los Angeles Knight Riders in our next match at Church Street Park in Morrisville on Sunday.\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom MLC 2024 brief scores: SO 124 in 19.4 overs (Heinrich Klaasen 51, Quinton de Kock 24, Lockie Ferguson 4/26, Saurabh Netravalkar 3/18) vs WF 127/5 in 18.2 overs (Lahiru Milantha 33*, Obus Pienaar 31*, Nandre Burger 2/27, Harmeet Singh 1/15)\n\nWashington Freedom won by five wickets.",

    "date": "Mon Jul 22 17:22:59 2024",
    "body": "Programming note: The San Francisco Unicorns-Washington Freedom match airs Monday at 5:30 p.m. PT on NBC Sports Bay Area Plus.\n\nCricket is one of the most popular global sports, but in the US, it is just starting to gain national attention.\n\nThe recently completed T20 World Cup featured matches in Texas, New York and Florida, and Major League Cricket -- with the San Francisco Unicorns as one of its inaugural six teams -- is about to wrap up its second season.\n\nAll-rounder Corey Anderson is at the center of both events.\n\nThe 33-year-old New Zealand native moved to the US in 2020 and joined Team USA to help spearhead the growth of cricket in the country.\n\nAnderson, the Unicorns' captain, helped Team USA stun Pakistan in World Cup group play in one of the biggest upsets in all of sports in recent memory.\n\nNow Anderson and the Unicorns (four wins, one loss, one no-result) are vying to win the Major League Cricket championship. They finish their regular-season schedule against the Washington Freedom on Monday night.\n\nNews\n\nThe Unicorns and Freedom will meet again Thursday in the MLC Qualifier. The winner advances to the Final.\n\nMI New York and the Texas Super Kings meet in the Eliminator match. The loser is done, but the winner advances to the Challenger, where they will take on the loser of the Unicorns-Freedom Qualifier.\n\nThe winner of the challenger heads to the Final, which takes place Sunday in Grand Prairie, Texas -- the venue for a majority of MLC's matches. Others are being played in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nSo there is a real chance the Unicorns and Freedom could play three consecutive times in a six-day span.\n\nAhead of the Unicorns' match on Monday, Anderson spoke with NBC Sports Bay Area about his journey to the US, growing the sport in the country, his experience in the World Cup, the Unicorns signing Australian National Team captain Pat Cummins and cricket returning to the Olympics in 2028.\n\n[Editor's note: This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity]\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area: “You're a native New Zealander. You spent about eight years representing that country, but you retired from that team back in 2020. And you moved here. And you now represent the U.S. Give new fans of cricket a brief overview of your professional career and what went into your decision to leave New Zealand and come to the U.S.”\n\nCorey Anderson: “I played for New Zealand, as you said, for give-or-take about eight years and a few injuries through then, so it was probably a little bit off and on. But yeah, played in multiple World Cups with New Zealand and it was the dream when I was a kid to play for the Black Caps and then in COVID 2020. I came across to the States and my wife is from Dallas, so that was the big reason for moving across. And saw an opportunity with the major league and thought, ‘Everyone's always been wanting America to grow with cricket and it's always been something that everyone's been really intrigued with.’ And I thought, ‘What better than getting in there on the ground level and trying to help this thing grow?’\n\n“I've been here for a period of time now and I mean, it's been great. To play for the US in the World Cup was unbelievable and extremely exciting. I didn't think my career would quite take that path or that journey. But it's exciting.”\n\nNBCSBA: “When did the possibility of playing for Major League Cricket first pop up for you and what about that appealed to you?”\n\nAnderson: “I think having a new competition – there’s so many of them jumping up. But like I said before, I think America being a pretty untapped market in terms of cricket. It just had so much interest to it. And I've always loved the States and I love American sports, and I think there was just something about it that kind of attracted me to it and I think it was an opportunity that was too hard to pass up on.\n\n“Just the growth and being able to kind of try and get your fingerprints on a new sport in America and help it grow, I think was the most exciting part. So that said, a lot of hoops to jump through and a lot of hurdles to get over. But yeah, it's getting there.”\n\nNBCSBA: “What has your experience been like so far in the first two years of actual gameplay for Major League cricket?\n\nAnderson: “It's been fantastic. We're really lucky here that the grounds that we do have are at a really high quality and the overseas players that we have bought across, as well as some of the best in the world, some of the best that are going around the T20 circuit. In terms of a fan of the game, being able to watch that and get eyes on, again, the biggest players in the world. Pretty cool to have that at your own back doorstep.\n\n“It's taken a heap attraction and there's been so many eyes on it. It's very early in the journey for it, but yeah, being the second season now, it's gone up and up and up and you know, hopefully, it continues on that trend.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Do you expect in future seasons, the seasons, to get longer as you guys gain more traction?”\n\nAnderson: “Yeah, I would imagine so. I don't think to a to a huge degree. I think scheduling around other competitions is still something that's a continual work on for every competition. But yeah, I could see this progressing out to playing a home and away game, you know, 10 games in a season, then the playoffs. But again, that's probably the infrastructure part is the big issue.\n\n“That's an ongoing thing. That's probably the biggest piece to the puzzle that needs to get sorted. And that stuff takes time to get through city planning and trying to find land for that. Unfortunately, cricket's not the makeshift baseball stadium or football stadium. So we can’t kind of just move it to one place and pack it up in the next.\n\n“So you've got to basically grow these things from the ground up or renovate existing stadiums. They can have the room to do it. There's a lot more moving pieces to try and grow that. But it has started in a lot of other places in the home. Places like San Francisco as well have started those conversations and trying to start those contracts and the construction of those stadiums.”\n\nNBCSBA: “I believe I've heard that Santa Clara County is trying to get a stadium or they're trying to build a stadium in Santa Clara County just south of San Francisco. Have you been to San Francisco? Have you been to the Bay Area? What do you know about the Bay Area?”\n\nAnderson: “I don't know the Bay Area really well, but I've been there a few times now. We normally have a little bit of a preseason when we go in and I think we've been great in terms of trying to have fan activation and try to grow the brand itself as well. And I think we're probably one of the only times that's actually doing that and getting out to say our hands [are] dirty into the environment and try and actually get our fan base and grow it so when we do have a stadium that we can play it in the home ground, we've got a fan base that will happily turn up and make sure that we can fill out a stadium. I think we've done a great job toward that. And I know that the marketing group on the staff at the uniforms have done a tremendous job.”\n\nNBCSBA: \"You have played in the [Indian Premier League] and you've played in the Big Bash [in Australia]. Those are established leagues around the world. How far is Major League Cricket from reaching that level and what needs to be done to get there?”\n\nAnderson: “The IPL is probably the pinnacle of all sports in terms cricket for the franchises, but Major League [Cricket has] got the potential to compete with it.\n\n“I think if you look at the broadcasting landscape in America, it's one of the biggest sports broadcasting countries in the world. And again, it's just been so untapped and underdeveloped, particularly with cricket here in this country. If we can grow it on that level and attract, I guess, more Americans to watch the game and get involved with it, that's more of a long-term play.\n\n“But it has such a big upside to it. And I think that's why people have been so excited about it, is it's just got so much room to grow. And considering cricket's second biggest pool in the world and I know it's very much dominated by the South Asian culture, but there's no reason why Americans can't love it and get around it and make it their own as well, right?”\n\nNBCSBA: “Is the key to success for cricket and Major League Cricket in the US appealing to people that already follow cricket in this country? Or is it appealing to new fans who don't know much about cricket and getting them to understand and buy into the sport?”\n\nAnderson: “I think it's a combination. That it's trying to find a happy medium, I guess pleasing the masses of the ones who already are the diehard cricket lovers. And so we're going to turn up to the games and I think obviously we always appreciate the support, but I think trying to grow this into America is trying to grab that local fan base and say, ‘Hey, this is a new game. It's an exciting game. If you're intrigued by it, come down, watch it, learn it.’ And I think over the last couple of months as well, especially with the [T20] World Cup, there was a lot of coverage around that and a lot of people, a lot of media outlets who normally don't discuss cricket started talking about cricket, which is fantastic for the game in general.\n\n“But again, there's the thirst for it and we just need to make sure we can kind of keep applying that when we can. And yeah, I think it's got so much room to grow. It's exciting. It's an exciting time to be involved in cricket in America.\n\nNBCSBA: “You were part of the Team USA win over Pakistan [in the T20 World Cup], which was a massive upset. I was in New York at the time and I got alerts from national media, American media, that normally don't send alerts about cricket. But that was a big, big deal. That was talked about everywhere. What was it like being part of that and just that kind of an upset?”\n\nAnderson: “It's pretty surreal. I mean, USA Cricket in terms of I guess our fan base itself is we're kind of basically unknown to a degree. I think a lot of Americans didn't realize we even had a cricket team. So we were obviously massive underdogs in terms of trying to go up against these big nations. And I think the beauty of it as well as I've been on the other side of it, where I've played for one of the top eight nations in the world, and you're always a chance at winning and you're always trying to strike winning that trophy.\n\n“And I think being on the other side now, it's funny because I know that can scare teams when you're a little team because you can ruin someone's day and ruin someone's World Cup. I think the outlook we had was, yes, we were underdogs, but let's lean into that and kind of create a little bit of carnage.\n\n“And if we can catch people on the hop a little bit and have them vulnerable and we end up having a good day, then I know we've got the talent to be able to do it. And I think we saw that against Pakistan. You tend to find against those big teams, the big teams might crumble and just have a really bad day and they end up losing the game instead of the other team winning.\n\n“But I think in that regard, when we played Pakistan, we genuinely beat them. We actually won. We played really good cricket from Ball One all the way through. Ideally, it wouldn't have gone [to a] Super Over. We probably dragged that out a little bit too much, but we still did the job and I think for 95 percent of that game we were in control.\n\n“And I think that shows people the talent that we do have that we can compete against some of the biggest players in the world. And that was a huge confidence booster, not only for the guys themselves, but I think just the landscape of cricket in America to understand that yes, we can compete and we can perform against these big teams and it shows people that there is the hype that's been drawn in the last two or three years around Major League Cricket and trying to grow it kind of gives a bit of an answer to say this is why these things are in place and this is where we can get to and this is why we need to continue to play high levels of cricket against the best teams in the world. Because we can compete, we can get better, and the only way is up. The sky's the limit in where we can actually go to. And I know there's a lot of local talent, a lot of young kids who are really good at cricket, but unfortunately there's never really been a pathway for them to continue playing the game.\n\n“So with Major League Cricket and Minor League Cricket, we can now say to the younger generation, there's a career for you here if you want it, and if you want to keep pursuing it and you love this game, it's all in front of you. And I think now that's a good time to get into cricket because it's just going to get bigger and bigger.\"\n\nNBCSBA: “It sets the stage for future World Cups, for Team USA in future World Cups. But also Cricket is returning to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles. Do you hope to play for Team USA in four years and how do you see that stage helping cricket grow in the US?\"\n\nAnderson: “I think in four more years’ time, it’s hard to know what's going to happen in four years' time. I moved here four years ago and a lot's happened in that space of time. So, look, I think that I'm extremely excited to be able to potentially have the opportunity to be involved in another World Cup and also an Olympics. I think the great thing as well is that USA cricket's generally never had more than kind of 12 months in front of them where they could plan and they know what they're doing and schedule and things like that.\n\n“We've now got a four-year cycle here where in two years’ time there's another T20 World Cup to try and prepare for. Post that another two years after that there is an Olympics and it's on our shores. And I think that's just such an exciting prospect to say not only to the cricketers themselves, but to sponsors anyone who wants to get involved with USA cricket is a four-year cycle here, which is a huge time to get involved. And the upside is massive, obviously, because you're now on the biggest stage and we've shown that we can compete on the biggest stage.\n\n“And again, the USA always has this wonderful thing of any time they plan an event, regardless of what sport it is or what league it is, eyes are always tuned to the US because again, that one of the most powerful countries in the world and in terms of sport, they love sports and I think they love an underdog and they love a winner.\n\n“And I think when we started taking the blocks on both of those during the World Cup, we obviously didn't win it entirely. But I think we probably arguably won people's hearts over during that process. And I think that kind of goes a long way to it as well.”\n\nNBCSBA: “You definitely got people's attention in this country. I had coworkers who don't watch cricket who saw that and were like, ‘Were you there for that match? I'm like, “No, I was in New York, not in Dallas,’ but that's the attention that kind of upset got. It was people that don't normally watch it are talking about it. So that's kind of the goal, right? Is to win the matches and get people's attention.\"\n\nAnderson: “And that's the thing. And there's going to be so many different ways to try and attract people to the game. It can't always just be the one side, but it's got to be so, so many different angles and so many different ways to try and get people to get involved in this game and understand it and learn it and love it. And that's just one of those places I think everyone loves when they're in love, loves a story and a narrative behind that and I think we've created that and we just need to continue to keep growing that as well.\n\n“And it's exciting for people to kind of know that they got an early on the journey and can see it start to flourish and see where it gets to over a period of time. We will also take bandwagon fans as well if we get to a point of that as well. But I think it's just exciting to obviously be involved with it and get to the point where we're at the moment.\n\n“I think the guys have made such huge sacrifices to be here and I think that probably gets missed a little bit. I know a lot of the guys aren’t originally born in the US and have got very different stories around how they got here. And I’ve heard multiple times just through other sources in terms media that it a bit of an artificial team. I think the guys take offense to that in a way because we’ve sacrificed a lot to be in this situation and moving countries and uprooting your life is not easy. And the guys worked very, very hard to get where they are. I know when we put on the USA jersey, we’re extremely proud to play for it.\n\n“And I think that was the big thing we discussed during the World Cup. Yes, we’re not the favorite. We’re not expected to win. We’re not even expected to through to the top eight. But if we lose every game, results are results and you can’t really do anything about the outcome. But we wanted to make sure we made USA proud of the cricket team and there’s so many ways you can do that, whether its chasing a ball to boundary, keep fighting to the very end regardless of how it looks. And I think we did that for the majority of the tournament and that’s what people loved the most about it. I think our attitude towards our, I guess, our moral compass of why and how we’re playing for the US is fantastic. Hopefully we can just shepherd the next generation into that USA team and continue to grow.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Has there been any talk of like Team USA doing tours of [countries] like India or Pakistan or Australia, New Zealand or South Africa or any of the big eight countries?\n\nAnderson: “I think I think that's something that the ICC is always going to have to be the one who does the scheduling and figure out those future tours. But I think again, there’s a need and a want. We obviously would love to do it because it increases the value of what we are doing and the talent that we have that’ll keep producing cricketers here and being able to know that they can play against these players. But I think sometimes it doesn't always match up with those schedulings..\n\n“And I know that teams would love to come across to the States and again, in time, I think when we have more infrastructure that's going to be more and more feasible. But yeah, I think if it's teams wanting to do almost like a mini-tour before they go to another nation, like a warm-up series or something like that, I think at that moment where we're not going to be extremely picky around who wants to do it, they come to our shores and I think that's the exciting thing.\n\n“I think they know now that when they play the USA, we can compete and they can get some really good cricket and be tested as well. So that probably hasn't happened in the past. So that's probably changed the narrative around who we can potentially play in and when we potentially play them. So that's extremely exciting.”\n\nNBCSBA: “[The Unicorns] recently added Australian National Team captain Pat Cummins. What has it been like having him on somebody of his stature on the roster?”\n\nAnderson: “It's huge. I mean, any time you bring in one of the best players in the world, it's going to lift the team and they're going to be extremely excited to play alongside him. And [I’ve been] lucky enough to play with Pat a handful of times during the IPL and he's a great human being as well.\n\n“Sometimes the biggest players in the world, sometimes it goes the other way when they get into a changing room. But the amount of knowledge that [he] has and what he's willing to give to guys, to help them. I think he's also saying this is an opportunity to help grow the game and it's an exciting prospect.\n\n“And kudos to him as well. He’s had hardly any time over the last six months, basically, and for him to want to be involved with the Unicorns is huge. It's not only for the players to be able to have him involved and the fans, but just the marketing aspect of having Pat involved in groups.\n\n“I know he's helped me tremendously in terms of captaining the side, calling on him to be a bit of a sounding board when I'm out there in the middle as well. It's been so valuable. He's a great guy to have in the group and I'm glad he's here long-term as well.\"\n\nNBCSBA: “I know he signed a four-year contract so … he made a sizable commitment to playing in Major League Cricket, playing for the Unicorns like that. That has to feel good that somebody of his stature is willing to make that kind of commitment. [He’s going to] come here every year for the next couple of years, right?\"\n\nAnderson: “Massively. I think it's smart for his side. And I think smart from the Unicorn side as well. I think you want to you want to get the best players in the world and you want to try and have as long as you possibly can. So yeah, I think that's a win-win for both camps and I know I'm extremely excited to have him in the group for a lot longer.\n\n“Hopefully we can continue to have a similar group going forward as well. I know franchise cricket tends to change very quickly and scheduling and availability always seems to be an issue that comes up. But the group at the moment is fantastic and I know we're winning and it makes things a little bit easier as well.\n\n“But regardless of that, that's been a great group to be around. And yeah, hopefully, we can kind of stick together and keep continuing to grow our culture as well.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Pat was quoted in a story recently that he said your presence, along with Coach Shane Watson, played a part in his decision to play in Major League Cricket. What does it mean to you to have that kind of impact on your peers?”\n\nAnderson: “Yes, that's great. I think you can try and get guys who enjoy playing alongside you or things like that. That's obviously such a big, big one in terms of feeling proud about what you're doing. But again, I think when you look at cricket as a whole and you look at the guys that you play alongside when you're out there in the field and your batting and bowling and fielding that, that's obviously from what people see is a big part of the game.\n\n“Obviously it's how you win games and it's how you go about your stuff. But I think the human element of it being off the field and understanding that when you've got a team that you get along with and guys gel well together, you can go and have a drink question or a coffee or whatever it might be, that makes such a huge difference in the performance part as well.\n\n“Like I said before, Pat's just a great human being and there's probably not so many better guys to have involved in this group. It's extremely exciting to have him and it's nice of him to say those kind words.”\n\nNBCSBA: “You guys play Washington [on Monday] and then you play them again in a Qualifier. You could potentially play them a third straight time in the [Major League Cricket] Final. How do you see your squad matching up with Washington? And then when you're preparing for a match like that and you know you're going to see them again potentially two more times, do you potentially hold anything back in [Monday’s] match so that you don't give them anything to look out for the following matches or do you play it straight up?”\n\nAnderson: “Good question. I mean, it's probably a little bit more of a unique situation because, like you said, yeah, we could be looking at playing them three times in a row. That's in a perfect world. That would be nice if that's the case, because it would mean we’re through to the Final. But that being said, yeah, tonight's an interesting one.\n\n“We've had a few niggles in the camp regarding some injuries and things like that, so we've just got to be cautious. Obviously moving forward. It's always nice to know that you're already in that 1 and 2 spot and playing in the Finals with another life. But I think momentum and cricket's such a massive thing and I think most sports would probably say the same thing that you want to get your straps and you kind of want to keep going and when things are thinking, you get yourself in those situations, more than not, you start understanding how you need to win and it'll change from game to game.\n\n“But I don't think you want to take the foot off the throat or foot off the gas. I think, yeah, you still got to put your best foot forward and try and play the best cricket you can. And yeah, there might be some tactics around something slightly different. But again, I think the talent that we've got on our side is it's obviously extremely exciting. “And hopefully tonight, [it] goes similar way to what has been as well and guys can do their job and we can still get a win. Yeah nice to know we're through the Finals. Still got work to do.\"",

They come into this final match having lost each of their last four, most recently going down by six wickets to San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nLAST THREE: LLL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIt’s key to wait until the respective line-ups are announced before making any investments here. As this match has nothing at stake, both teams, particularly Texas Super Kings with a crunch eliminator on the horizon could choose to give their key players a rest. Captain Faf du Plessis should play though and remains top of the run-scoring table in Major League Cricket this season with 264 runs to his name so far. Back him to accumulate another 20+ runs here.\n\nMarcus Stoinis’ big-hitting exploits are not to be ignored as his brute power makes him a prime candidate for investment via the relevant betting markets available. Explore backing the Australian all-rounder to strike the most sixes across this encounter for Texas Super Kings.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWe mentioned Faf du Plessis and his position at the top of the run-scoring charts. Trailing just behind him is Ryan Rickelton, with 225 runs under his belt, including a top score of 103 not out. His personal ambition would likely be to try and overhaul his fellow South African, so backing him to score a fifty in this match may prove a smart move.\n\nWe’ve touched upon the bowling skills of domestic player Harmeet Singh previously and it’s these USA stars who arguably have the most to prove as we edge towards the latter end of this tournament. Harmeet no doubt wants to show that he is worthy of franchise gigs in other competitions down the line by adding to his eight wickets gained across this tournament. Back Harmeet to finish as Seattle’s top bowler here.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS VS SEATTLE ORCAS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nAs much as the Seattle Orcas management will want a win over the Super Kings to end their tournament, the reality is that most of their squad are likely to have their minds elsewhere at this point, specifically on their next cricketing assignment whether it be a franchise gig or international commitments.\n\nMotivation is higher for Texas Super Kings, knowing that two straight losses going into the play-offs would not bode well for them. Add that to home advantage being in their favour and the expectation is that Texas will gain the victory, even if they were to rotate their team.",

    "body": "Right then, that will be it from us for this contest. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. The action continues at the Major League Cricket, 2024. The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the Seattle Orcas in Match 21 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas. It will be another dead rubber as the four teams for the playoffs are already locked in. That game will be played on July 24th and will start at 6.00 am IST (12.30 am GMT). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nThe skipper of San Francisco Unicorns, Corey Anderson is up for a chat. He says that they had seen glimpses of Sanjay Krishnamurthi before and he feels proud of how Sanjay performed today. Adds that he is only 20 and he has got such maturity. Says that he will be a big player for them in their following games. Mentions that Hassan Khan is a key player for them as well and ends by saying that they can rely on him at any part of their innings.\n\nSteve Smith, the Washington Freedom skipper says that they played nicely and had a good score on board. Adds that it was a reasonable chase and the Unicorns batted well. Shares that they wanted to take the game on Travis Head has been exceptional. Mentions that today he got off to a fast start and Travis Head played as a second fiddle. Ends by lauding the Unicorn batters sharing that it got challenging with the wet outfield but plenty to learn in the rain-reduced game.\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his sensational knock. He says that he decided to go hard from the beginning. Adds that he wanted to take his chances and it came off today. Shares that he worked on the mental side, and that helped him to play freely. Mentions that it was not turning much for the left-arm spinners, so he was trying to keep a calm head in the middle and it paid off.\n\nJosh Inglis is in for a chat.

Adds that this will give them confidence in the qualifiers and this win was needed. Ends by saying that it was an outstanding innings from Sanjay Krishnamurthi and this is a good confidence booster for him.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Washington Freedom batted first and made 174 in 15.3 overs before the innings was shortened by rain. Both Travis Head and Steven Smith scored outstanding fifties while Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra played handy cameos. Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan were the pick of the bowlers for the Unicorns on a run fest day in Dallas. This win gets the San Francisco Unicorns on par with the Washington Freedom on the points table but they will finish second as the Freedom have a superior net run rate.\n\nWashington Freedom started well with the ball but failed to keep it tight through the middle and the latter over. Akeal Hosein got the early wicket of Finn Allen while Andrew Tye got three for 41. All the bowlers, except Rachin Ravindra went for over 12 runs to the over and it was absolute carnage. Washington Freedom did rest quite a few of their first-choice bowlers but wouldn't have thought to lose after setting a huge score. They will want to take the learnings from this game before they meet the Unicorns again in Qualifer 1.\n\nAn extraordinary run chase from the San Francisco Unicorns sees them defeat the Washington Freedom by 6 wickets with just 2 balls to spare. The Unicorns needed 177 to win off the 14 overs as per the DLS Method and they have done it in some style. Chasing the score, the openers departed early but Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis smoked it all around the park and added 77 runs in just 5 overs. Inglis made a quick-fire 45 off 17 while Hassan Khan chipped in with an unbeaten cameo of 32 off 11. The star of the chase was Sanjay Krishnamurthi who made a brilliant 79 off just 42 and took his team over the line. With this win, San Francisco Unicorns become the first side to defeat the Washington Freedom this season.\n\n4\n\nOvers12.6\n\nScore174 - 4\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar to Hassan Khan, FOUR! Make that three in a row! Full toss, outside off. Hassan Khan swings hard again and gets another outside edge that runs to the deep third region for a hat-trick of boundaries.

Sanjay Krishnamurthi picks it early and hammers it over the deep square leg boundary for half a dozen. Sanjay Krishnamurthi is playing a gem of a knock here. The equation is now 23 off 13 balls.\n\nW\n\nOvers9.6\n\nScore122 - 4\n\nAndrew Tye to Sherfane Rutherford, OUT! STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR AND TAKEN! Tye gets two in the over! Goes short of a length, around off. Sherfane Rutherford miscues the pull and goes straight up in the air. Andrew Tye goes to his right and takes a good catch off his bowling. Sherfane Rutherford departs for a second ball duck. San Francisco Unicorns are four down.\n\nW\n\nOvers9.4\n\nScore122 - 3\n\nAndrew Tye to Josh Inglis, OUT! CAUGHT! Josh Inglis is gone!

As a result, he was chosen for the Karnataka State Cricket Association U-16 team.\n\n#4 He came back to Houston in 2020\n\nSanjay came to Houston at the start of 2020 to participate in a USA Cricket training camp.

    "body": "The final league fixture of the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) will witness the Texas Super Kings (TSK) take on the Seattle Orcas (SOR). The contest is a dead rubber to a degree with TSK having sealed a place in the Eliminator clash, while SOR have also officially finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nDespite their fate being sealed, both sides would love to end the league stage on a high. TSK will look for some momentum ahead of the high-octane Eliminator clash against the MI New York, especially having lost to the Washington Freedom by a significant margin.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas, on the other hand, have to play for their pride. Following a successful maiden season in 2023 where they finished as runner-ups, the franchise could only compile a single win this time around and are currently on a four-game losing streak.\n\nEven though it has not been a very memorable season for both sides, particularly the Seattle Orcas, there have been some standout individual performers from both sides. On that note, let us take a look at a combined Texas Super Kings-Seattle Orcas playing 11 for MLC 2024.\n\nTop order: Faf du Plessis, Ryan Rickleton, and Quinton de Kock\n\nTSK skipper Faf du Plessis is the leading scorer of the tournament so far with 264 runs in five matches at a strike rate of 166.03. He recorded a stunning hundred against the Washington Freedom and has scored consecutive fifties in his last two appearances against the MI New York and the reverse fixture against the Washington Freedom.\n\nAfter a prolific SA20 2024 campaign where he ended up as the leading run scorer, Rickleton has carried the same form into the MLC as well. He was part of the South Africa squad that finished runner-ups in the 2024 T20 World Cup but failed to avail a single chance in the playing XI. In the ongoing season, he has accumulated 225 runs in five innings at a strike rate of 149.\n\nQuinton de Kock has donned the role at No.3 with the Seattle Orcas, and he has done a decent job of it. The left-handed wicket-keeper batter has scored 144 runs in six outings at a strike rate of 123.07.\n\nMiddle Order: Heinrich Klaasen, Marcus Stoinis, and Calvin Savage\n\nThe Seattle Orcas skipper had memorable IPL and T20 World Cup campaigns, despite ending up as runner-ups in both. However, his momentum seems to have run its course for the momentum as he had a mediocre MLC 2024 season. He has only scored 93 runs in six matches, including one fifty. However, he still remains one of the best batters in the format, and remains a threat for the opposition.\n\nStoinis came into the MLC on the back of a brilliant 2024 T20 World Cup for Australia. The all-rounder has been decent with the bat and expensive with the ball but has been among the wickets in a very short time.\n\nCalvin Savage has been a handy player for TSK in the lower middle order. He has scored 75 runs in four innings at a strike rate of 153, including a quick-fire 35 in TSK's most recent outing.\n\nLower Order: Imad Wasim, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Gannon, Zia-ul-Haq, and Harmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon is among the leading wicket-takers in the tournament with 10 wickets in six matches. The pacer is the joint second-highest wicket-taker along with Rashid Khan. Although his economy is a bit on the higher side, he is an able spearhead to the bowling attack.\n\nThe TSK pace bowling duo of Dwayne Bravo and Zia-ul-Haq are valuable additions to the attack to bring balance and variety. Zia-ul-Haq is the joint-highest wicket-taker for TSK with six scalps. while the veteran Bravo has picked up four wickets in four matches, with an economy of 8.36 while bowling the tough overs.\n\nThe spin attack of Imad Wasim and Harmeet Singh has been difficult for the batters to deal with considering their varied skill set. The left-arm finger spinners have picked up a combined total of 12 wickets, with their average economy reading just 7.10.",
    "summary": "* The final league fixture of MLC 2024 will feature Texas Super Kings (TSK) against Seattle Orcas (SOR), with TSK already securing a spot in the Eliminator clash and SOR finishing at the bottom of the table.\n* Both teams aim to end the league stage on a high, with TSK seeking momentum ahead of their Eliminator clash against MI New York and SOR playing for pride.\n* Despite a disappointing season, there have been standout individual performers from both teams, including Faf du Plessis, Ryan Rickleton, Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, Marcus Stoinis, Calvin Savage, Imad Wasim, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Gannon, Zia-ul-Haq, and Harmeet Singh.\n* These players have contributed to their teams with impressive batting and bowling performances, with some of them being among the top scorers and wicket-takers in the tournament.",

    "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 is now just two games away from the knockout stages. San Francisco Unicorns are up against Washington Freedom in an important clash on Tuesday, July 23.\n\nWashington Freedom have been unbeaten throughout this tournament so far. With five wins and a no-result out of six games, they are at the top of the table with 11 points.\n\nThey beat the Texas Super Kings by 42 runs in their previous match. On the other hand, San Francisco Unicorns are placed second with four wins and nine points from six clashes.\n\nThey also beat the Seattle Orcas coming into this game. Both teams have already made it to the Qualifier of MLC 2024, which will be played on July 26. This game will thus serve as a preparatory ground as they will face each other yet again.\n\nOn that note, here is a combined playing 11 with players from both sides ahead of their final league stage match.\n\nCombined San Francisco Unicorns-Washington Freedom playing 11 for MLC 2024\n\nOpeners: Finn Allen, Travis Head\n\nFinn Allen, with 186 runs from five innings at a strike-rate of 202.17, is the fifth-highest run-getter of the tournament. He has scored the most runs for San Francisco this year.\n\nIn their previous outing against Seattle, Allen struck a brutal 30-ball 77, striking at 256.66, that helped them chase down a total of 152 with ease.\n\nPartnering him at the top would be Travis Head, who has also displayed great form for Washington Freedom. With 194 runs from six games, he is the third-highest run-getter of the MLC 2024.\n\nHead has been consistent throughout, smashing three fifties and a hundred, including a 22-ball 53 in the last match.\n\nMiddle-order and all-rounders: Steve Smith (C), Rachin Ravindra, Andries Gous (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Corey Anderson\n\nSteve Smith has proved to be a great inclusion for Washington Freedom this season. He has scored 191 runs from six innings at an average of 63.66 and is the fourth-highest run-getter as well.\n\nThe Washington Freedom skipper scored a crucial 57 in the last game and would also captain this combined side.\n\nRachin Ravindra may not have shone with the bat in the MLC 2024 so far, scoring only 69 runs from four innings. However, he has been a key asset with the ball for Washington Freedom, picking up five wickets, including a four-fer in their previous fixture.\n\nAndries Gous would handle the wicket-keeping duties. He has a fifty to his name this season and has displayed some power-hitting ability. Gous scored a quickfire 9-ball 15 in the last game as well.\n\nGlenn Maxwell has not been as effective with the bat this season yet. He has only managed to score 59 runs from three innings. However, he scored a crucial 23-ball 34 in the previous match and grabbed three wickets as well. His all-round skills make him a valuable asset.\n\nObus Pienaar played a vital role in giving Washington Freedom a solid finish with the bat in their last match. He scored an unbeaten 21-ball 33. Pienaar has displayed his ability to provide stability down the order and contribute with some important runs as well.\n\nCorey Anderson is another all-round who would add to the strength of this combined team. He has a high score of an unbeaten 59 this season and also picked up a wicket in the last game against Texas.\n\nBowlers: Hassan Khan, Jasdeep Singh, Lockie Ferguson\n\nLeft-arm spinner Hassan Khan has picked up six wickets in the tournament for the San Francisco Unicorns. He impressed in the previous game, returning with figures of 3/5 from his two overs, thus also being economical.\n\nJasdeep Singh, coming in for Saurabh Netravalkar, had big shoes to fill in. The right-arm pacer has been brilliant for Washington Freedom in his limited opportunities this season.\n\nJasdeep has picked up six wickets from just two games at an economy rate of 5.57. He also bagged three wickets in their last match against Texas, giving away just 25 runs in four overs.\n\nLockie Ferguson is the fifth-highest wicket-taker in MLC 2024 at the moment. He has accounted for nine wickets from six games with a decent economy rate of 7.27. Ferguson has also picked up four-fer in the MLC this season.",

    "body": "On the back of a vintage display of power hitting from Captain Kieron Pollard and some responsible batting from Nicholas Pooran, defending champions MI New York booked a spot in the 2024 Major League Cricket Playoffs with a four-wicket win over the Los Angeles Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas on Sunday.\n\nBoth teams entered Sunday’s clash knowing a win would be good enough for them to join the San Francisco Unicorns, Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings in the playoffs.\n\nAfter winning the toss and electing to field first, MI New York restricted the LA Knight Riders to 130 all out off 19.1 overs.\n\nThe hard-hitting Andre Russell did the bulk of the scoring for the Sunil Narine-led knight Riders with 35 while Jason Roy hit 27 at the top of the innings.\n\nLeg-spinner Rashid Khan was the pick of the New York bowlers with 3-22 from his four overs while Nosthush Kenjige and Trent Boult supported well with two wickets, each.\n\nMI New York then needed only 17 overs to reach 134-6 and book their spot in the playoffs after winning just one of their first six games of the season.\n\nNicholas Pooran led the way with 35 off 28 balls but it was Pollard’s blistering 33* off just 12 balls that sealed victory.\n\nPooran’s knock included two fours and as many sixes while Pollard hit two fours and three sixes.\n\nDewald Brevis also chipped in with a 19-ball 27.\n\nNarine took 2-24 from his four overs for the Knight Riders.\n\nFull Scores:\n\nLA Knight Riders 130 all out off 19.1 overs (Andre Russell 35, Jason Roy 27, Rashid Khan 3-22, Nosthush Kenjige 2-22, Trent Boult 2-38)\n\nMI New York 134-6 off 17 overs (Nicholas Pooran 35, Kieron Pollard 33*, Dewald Brevis 27, Sunil Narine 2-24)\n\nBen Stokes hailed Shoaib Bashir after the 20-year-old's five-wicket haul helped England clinch a series victory over West Indies on Sunday.\n\nEngland surged to a 243-run victory on day four at Trent Bridge, with Bashir finishing with figures of 5-41.\n\nThe hosts started the day 248-3 thanks to a terrific partnership between Joe Root (122) and Harry Brook (109), ultimately setting the Windies a target of 385 to win.\n\nBashir bowled a spell of 3-8 in 15 deliveries, then put some gloss on his performance by rounding off the tail with the dismissals of Jason Holder and Shamar Joseph.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the win, captain Stokes said: \"I didn't see it happening that quickly after the opening partnership, I thought they played well.\n\n\"You could see at the end of our innings the wicket started misbehaving more than it did in the first three days, a couple were bouncing and then keeping low.\n\n\"I thought the way we fought back after that first wicket was impressive, Bashir getting five wickets on a wicket that didn't really do that much.\n\n\"I thought he showed his class and his ability to be able to change his pace and undercut the ball. The wicket of Jason Holder showed the world what he's got.\"\n\nEngland will now target a series sweep when the Windies go to Edgbaston next week, before taking on Sri Lanka in three Tests between late August and early September.\n\n\"It has been a great start after a long break between Test series. I think we've played some good cricket but I still think we can get better,\" Stokes said.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to the next four matches.\"\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events on the fourth day of the second Test at Trent Bridge, the West Indies suffered a resounding 241-run defeat to England, sealing a 2-0 series loss with one Test still to play. Despite the crushing defeat, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite remained optimistic, acknowledging the team's effort while highlighting areas for improvement.\n\nEngland's Shoaib Bashir was the star of the match, claiming his first five-wicket haul on English soil. His 5 for 41 wrapped up the West Indies innings inside 90 minutes of the final session, ensuring England's dominant victory.\n\nReflecting on the match, Brathwaite said, \"I'm reasonably happy with the performance, but it could have been better with the ball. We were good in the first innings but didn't follow through in the second. The effort from the guys was there; the fitness is evident. We need to be much more disciplined. England showed us how to bowl on this pitch, particularly avoiding getting hit square of the wicket. But the guys will learn. Kavem's hundred followed by a duck is just how Test cricket goes.\"\n\nBrathwaite continued, \"We dropped some crucial catches, and that happens. We need to improve our line and length, but catches win matches. I wouldn't have expected that collapse, but it's gone, it's history. Test cricket is never an easy game. We've got to stay tough and keep fighting.\"\n\nEngland's comprehensive win was set up by centuries from Joe Root and Harry Brook, who propelled the hosts to 425 in their second innings. This marked the first time in England's history that they scored over 400 runs in both innings of a Test. Chasing a daunting target of 385, the West Indies started positively, reaching 61 without loss thanks to Brathwaite and Mikyle Louis. However, a devastating spell from Chris Woakes and Bashir saw the team crumble, losing 5 for 21 in the space of 35 balls and ultimately bowled out for 143.\n\nBrathwaite was the top scorer for the West Indies with 47 runs, but his efforts were overshadowed by Bashir's record-breaking performance. At 20 years and 282 days, Bashir became the youngest England bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a men's Test at home, surpassing the previous record held by recently retired seamer James Anderson.\n\nEngland's first innings score of 416, bolstered by Ollie Pope's 121 and contributions from Ben Duckett and Ben Stokes, set the stage for their commanding position. The West Indies initially responded well with 457, featuring a century from Hodge and notable performances from Da Silva and Athanaze. However, the team faltered in their second innings, leading to a decisive English victory.",

However, the highlight of the match was undoubtedly Akeal Hosein’s dismissal of Finn Allen for a golden duck.\n\nAkil Hossein’s deadly delivery\n\nWhile Krishnamurthi’s inning was undoubtedly crucial, Hosein’s dismissal of Finn captured everyone’s attention. Allen, known for his aggressive batting, came to the crease with high expectations. However, Hosein had other plans.\n\nThe left-arm spinner delivered a skiddy delivery that came into the right-hander. Allen, looking to pull, was deceived by the pace and trajectory of the ball. The delivery crashed into the middle stump, leaving Allen stunned and Washington’s dugout in jubilation.\n\nHosein’s dismissal of Allen was a crucial breakthrough for Washington.

The chase, however, wasn’t without its hiccups. Chasing a modest target of 135, New York found themselves in a precarious position at 102/5 in the 13th over. But then came the turning point of the match – Kieron Pollard‘s awe-inspiring display of power hitting.\n\nKieron Pollard unleashes a six-hitting frenzy.\n\nWith the pressure mounting and playoffs hanging in the balance, Pollard stepped onto the field, shouldering the responsibility of reviving his team’s fortunes. The 14th over witnessed a masterclass in power hitting as Pollard took on LA Knight Riders’ bowler Spencer Johnson.\n\nThe first ball was dispatched over mid-wicket for a six, setting the tone for what was to come. Johnson attempted to change tactics with a length ball angling in, but Pollard responded with a monstrous 91-meter six over square leg. The crowd roared in appreciation as Pollard completed the hattrick of sixes with a disdainful chip over the bowler’s head for another maximum.\n\nThese three consecutive sixes not only yielded 18 crucial runs but also completely shifted the match’s momentum. The required run rate, once a daunting task, suddenly seemed achievable. Pollard continued his assault, adding another boundary and bringing his side to an easy match-winning situation with a well-made 33 runs off just 12 deliveries.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Pat Cummins and Corey Anderson star in the comedy of errors on the pitch in MLC 2024\n\nNicholas Pooran’s professional approach gets MI through to playoffs\n\nEarlier, despite Andre Russell‘s 35, LA Knight Riders failed miserably as a batting unit.

Ultimately, they were restricted to 130 runs thanks to bowling spells from Rashid Khan (3/22) and Nosthush Kenjige (2/22).\n\nOn the other hand, New York started shaky and under immense pressure.

The wicket came in the final over of LAKR’s innings and ended their challenge at 130 runs, giving Pollard’s team a clear path to chase down the target.\n\nA defining moment for Kieron Pollard\n\nPollard’s dismissal of Russell was a high-pressure scenario that saw the veteran all-rounder rise to the occasion. With LAKR struggling at 102/9 in the 17th over, Russell’s explosive hitting had propelled their score past the 130 runs mark. Russell was on a roll, having struck two boundaries each too Rashid Khan, Romario Shepherd and Trent Boult. His 35 off 20 deliveries was a significant contribution, but he found himself facing Pollard in the final over.\n\nThe final over drama: Battle with Andre Russell\n\nPollard, known for his match-winning abilities, took charge of the last over with the game hanging in balance. He delivered a length ball, which Russell attempted to pull but could only manage a top edge. Wicket-keeper Nicholas Pooran, alert to the situation, sprinted to his left and made a crucial catch, dismissing Russell and sealing the innings for LAKR. Pollard’s ecstatic celebration, including wild screams and jubilant fist pumps, reflected the importance of the moment and his relief at securing the crucial wicket.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso READ: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024: Broadcast, live streaming details – When and Where to watch in India, US, UK, Australia & other countries\n\nPollard’s power play secures MI New York’s playoff spot\n\nNew York’s chase was anchored by Dewald Brevis, who provided a solid foundation with a brisk 27.

His unbeaten 33 off just 12 balls not only secured the victory but also highlighted his finishing prowess.

    "body": "Mumbai Indians New York skipper Kieron Pollard led from the front in the game against Los Angeles Knight Riders in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. The 19th match of the tournament between the teams took place at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday (22nd July).\n\nKieron Pollard was at the top of his game with the bat and ball in the game against Los Angeles Knight Riders. In a game where qualification was at stake, the all-rounder came up with a clutch performance and helped his team win the game and enter the playoffs of the second edition of the Major League Cricket.\n\nKieron Pollard first gave himself the responsibility to bowl the last over of the innings against Andre Russell, who was going great guns. The Mumbai Indians New York skipper, however, made sure he stepped up for his team and removed his Carribean teammate to put his team in a strong position.\n\nOn the first ball of the last over, Kieron Pollard banged in a short ball on middle stump. Andre Russell got rushed by it as he tried to pull the ball which hit the splice and went up. Keeper Nicholas Pooran covered a lot of ground to his left and took a good catch.\n\nWhat caught the attention of many was the celebration of Kieron Pollard after he took the wicket of Andre Russell. The Mumbai Indians New York skipper got pumped up as he got rid of a dangerous batter. He celebrated aggressively and the video of that went viral on the internet.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nAfter removing Andre Russell with the ball, Kieron Pollard came up with a magical effort with the bat. Mumbai Indians New York needed to chase the target of 131 runs in 18.2 overs and his team was left tottering at 91/5. But it was the skipper who came up with a magical effort and took his team home.\n\nKieron Pollard scored an unbeaten 33 runs off 12 balls as he did the carnage on the bowlers. The all-rounder batted with a strike rate of 275 and slammed 2 fours and 3 sixes in his innings. His knock ensured that Mumbai Indians New York chased the target in 17 overs and qualified for the playoffs.\n\nIt was a plan that worked out in the end - Kieron Pollard on his bowling\n\nKieron Pollard talked about the win after the game and claimed that he was relieved. He talked about the pride he takes in performing for Mumbai Indians. The all-rounder also opened up about his bowling and stated that his plan worked out. Speaking at the post-match presentation, he explained:\n\n\"Very relieved, congrats to the entire team. The way we fought, everyone chipped in usefully. If we look at the history of how we've batted, 130 was a tough ask. But we got another opportunity, and the attitude shown by everyone was fantastic. I've had some experience, Nosthush came to me after one game and said that things would turn out well, my family was always backing me, coming from a young player, it meant a lot. I always pride myself on performing for the franchise and I'm glad it came off today.\n\n\"It was a plan that worked out in the end (on bowling the 20th over), I could've gone for 20 and they could have got past 150. I could have gone for the young guy (Rushil Ugarkar), but it was one of the days when we got what we wanted. I heard that one of the supporters in the crowd got hit, I hope she's OK and I hope we can do something for her on our part to make her happy,\" he concluded.",

In the post-match presentation, Pollard expressed relief and pride in performing for his franchise, attributing the win to team effort and a well-executed plan.",

Smith scored 56 off 31 balls and his knock was laden with four sixes and five fours. Whereas Head hit three sixes and five boundaries for his 36-ball 56, his fourth straight fifty in the competition.\n\nChasing a revised target of 177 in 14 overs, the San Francisco Unicorns got to the target in just 13.4 overs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi remained unbeaten on 79 off 42 balls for SFU while Josh Inglis hit 45 from 17 balls.\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Tye finished as the top wicket-taker in the match with figures of 3/41.\n\nBatting first, Head and Smith did what they have done throughout the season, by providing us a rollicking start. Smith took the role of the aggressor smashing three sixes and five fours in the powerplay as we raced to 70/0 after the first six overs, the fourth fifty-plus stand for the Aussies together this season.\n\nSmith powered to a 25-ball fifty in the eighth over and soon the duo got to our first 100-run partnership in the history of MLC before the skipper departed. Head shifted gears to get to his half-century in just 34 balls continuing his purple patch this season.\n\nRachin Ravindra and Andries Gous kept the scoring rate high with an entertaining partnership of 33 off only 15 balls. Just as we were looking to go past the 200-run mark for the second consecutive game, rain halted proceedings, cutting short our batting essay with 27 balls remaining.\n\nAkeal Hosein gave us a great start after the rain delay, striking with the first ball of the chase to send back Finn Allen. Andrew Tye dismissed the big fish, Jake Fraser-McGurk, leaving both openers back in the hut by the fifth over with the score at 45.\n\nThe experienced Tye brought us back into the match with two wickets in an over after Krishnamurthi and Inglis added 77 runs in just 30 balls for the third wicket. In the end, the San Francisco Unicorns chased down the target with two balls to spare.\n\nHassan Khan contributed a cameo of 32 from 11 balls, while Krishnamurthi remained unbeaten on 79. Apart from Tye, Hosein picked up 1/39 from his three overs.\n\nHowever, the result had no bearing on the points table of MLC 2024 as we finished on top with 11 points from seven games after all our group engagements.\n\nWe will meet the San Francisco Unicorns again in the Qualifier of MLC 2024 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday.\n\nWashington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns MLC 2024 brief scores: WF 174/3 in 15.3 overs (Steve Smith 56, Travis Head 56, Corey Anderson 2/20) vs SFU 177/4 in 13.4 overs (Sanjay Krishnamurthi 79*, Josh Inglis 45, Andrew Tye 3/41, Akeal Hosein 1/39).\n\nWashington Freedom lost by six wickets by DLS method.",

    "body": "After the ICC Mens T20 World Cup thrilled American sports fans with top-tier cricket matches at venues in Florida, New York and Texas, Major League Cricket is gearing up for an exciting second season of progress.\n\nMajor League Cricket will conclude its 21-match season this week, culminating in a thrilling four-team play-off to crown a new champion. Despite having six teams spread across the country, all competitions are being held on dedicated cricket grounds in Texas and North Carolina. Remarkably, attendances are on track to surpass the impressive 70,000 fans who turned out for the inaugural season in 2023.\n\nA key strategy Major League Cricket has employed to attract a broader audience is its media rights arrangement with Cricbuzz’s Willow, a specialist cricket channel. Willow has established partnerships with regional sports networks in each team’s local market, including Bally Sports SoCal for Los Angeles, Monumental Sports Network for Washington, DC, and NBC Sports Bay Area for San Francisco, among many others. This tactic mirrors Willow’s successful approach during the T20 World Cup, where it focused on increasing visibility.\n\nIn terms of finances, Major League Cricket operates within a salary cap of $1.15 million per team. While this figure is below the generous budgets seen in global leagues such as the Indian Premier League, which allows franchises to spend around $12 million annually, it remains competitive with leagues such as Cricket Australia ($2 million) and The Hundred ($1.3 million) in the UK.\n\nLiam Plunkett, a bowler for the San Francisco Unicorns and member of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, praises the quality and competitiveness of the competition. “The money is good. But the product is good too,” Plunkett notes, highlighting the high standard of play that attracts fans and players alike.\n\nSan Francisco’s signing of Australian national team captain Pat Cummins on a four-year contract ahead of the season was a major move that reflects the league’s ambition. Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman reveals that such contracts have proven surprisingly feasible given the excitement surrounding the emerging US cricket market.\n\nLooking ahead, the league has ambitious plans for expansion, aiming to establish stadiums in each team’s market and expand the schedule to 34 games by 2025. With the intention of increasing the number of franchises to 10, Major League Cricket is poised for continued growth and success in the American sports landscape.\n\nRelated\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

    "body": "Here are the Fantasy Cricket Predictions and Betting Tips for the Major League Cricket Match 18- San Francisco Unicorns vs Settle Orcas, which will be played on the 20th of July at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas.\n\nPoints Table\n\nMatch 18- San Francisco Unicorns vs Seattle Orcas (Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas)\n\nCurrent Form San Francisco Unicorns:\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns are currently placed at the 2nd position on points table with 3 wins and 1 loss to their credit.\n\nThe top run scorer for San Francisco Unicorns in the Major League Cricket is Matthew Short with 151 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for San Francisco Unicorns in the Major League Cricket is Liam Plunkett with 5 scalps under his belt.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have won their previous match against MI New York by 3 runs.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns batted first and they posted a total of 148 for 7 in 20 overs. The top order struggled a lot. Their prime form batters including Matthew Short and Josh Inglis got out cheaply. They were under a lot of pressure from that moment on. The middle order of San Francisco Unicorns came good as Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan smashed 59 and 44 runs respectively to help San Francisco Unicorns get to a strong total of 148 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Seattle Orcas lost Ruben Clinton quite early into the innings. Dewald Brevis played like a champion and he smashed 56 runs off 36 balls. He instilled the hope for a successful chase. Nicholas Pooran also supported him well, he scored 26 runs but consumed too many balls to get going. It cost the team dearly. The rest of the middle order batters including Romario Shepherd and Monank Patel failed terribly and despite the efforts of Heath Richards, who smashed 24 off 13 balls, Seattle Orcas failed to achieve the target and fell short by 3 runs in the end.\n\nCurrent Form Seattle Orcas:\n\nSeattle Orcas are currently placed at the bottom most position on points table with 1 win and 4 losses to their credit.\n\nThe top run scorer for Seattle Orcas in the Major League Cricket is Ryan Rickelton with 225 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Seattle Orcas in the Major League Cricket is Cameron Gannon with 9 scalps under his belt.\n\nSeattle Orcas have lost their previous match against LA Knight Riders by 4 wickets.\n\nSeattle Orcas batted first and they posted a total of 142 for 6 in 20 overs. Except for Ryan Rickelton, no other batter showed any promise whatsoever. The big names like Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen and Aaron Jones, all failed to get going. Rickelton smashed 89 off 52 balls but he barely got any support at the other end. Once he got out in the 19th over, it was all clear that Orcas will not reach a decent total. They were littled and only scored 142 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Sunil Narine as usual got out cheaply. Jason Roy tried his best to take control but he consumed too many balls for his knock of 27 runs. A real game changing innings was played by Unmukt Chand, who smashed 62 runs off 47 balls. He was aided by the lower order batters who contributed healthily and helped LA Knight Riders get over the line in the 20th over with 4 wickets in hand.\n\nBatting Stats T20\n\nLet’s have a look at the squads:\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nPat Cummins, Qais Ahmad, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Henry, Mackenzie Harvey, Lungi Ngidi, Brody Couch, Tajinder Singh, Josh Inglis, Matthew Wade, Jahmar Hamilton, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Smit Patel, David White, Corey Anderson, Finn Allen, Carmi le RouxLiam Plunkett, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Haris Rauf, Shadab Khan\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nNandre Burger, Harmeet Singh, Obed McCoy, Nathan Ellis, Shubham Ranjane, Andrew Tye, Angelo Perera, Hayden Walsh, Nauman Anwar, Michael Bracewell, Dwaine Pretorius, Nisarg Patel, Shimron Hetmyer, Cameron Gannon, Dasun Shanaka, Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen, Shehan Jayasuriya, Wayne Parnell, Quinton de Kock, Ryan Rickelton, Imad Wasim, Phani Simhardi\n\nWicket Takers T20",

However, Finn Allen's explosive 77 off 30 balls took the San Francisco Unicorns to a comfortable six-wicket win.\n\nWith this victory, the San Francisco Unicorns remain in second place on the points table with nine points from six matches, while the Seattle Orcas have been officially eliminated from the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nAlready qualified for the playoffs, the San Francisco Unicorns began their run chase of 153 runs at a blistering pace. They smashed 79 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to Finn Allen's 21-ball fifty. He struck 26 runs in the fifth over, bowled by Lungi Ngidi, which featured two sixes and three fours.\n\nMatthew Short, on the other hand, was dismissed by Imad Wasim in the seventh over after scoring 19 off 14 balls. Allen continued in the same vein, hitting two sixes off Harmeet Singh before being caught by Ryan Rickelton on the fifth ball of the eighth over. He scored 77 off 30 balls, leaving San Francisco at 98/2 after eight overs.\n\nThe Unicorns then lost two more wickets in consecutive overs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed for 10 off 16 balls in the 13th over, followed by Sherfane Rutherford in the 14th, who scored 17 off 8 balls. However, Josh Inglis and Corey Anderson guided San Francisco to a comfortable six-wicket win with 34 balls to spare.\n\nIn a must-win game, the Seattle Orcas faced a disastrous start after being invited to bat first. They lost both openers in the very first over: Ryan Rickelton was caught by Finn Allen on the first ball, and Aaron Jones was trapped LBW by Carmi le Roux.\n\nDespite an early setback, Seattle managed to score 48 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to an aggressive counter-attack by Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya. They added 34 runs in the last two overs of the Powerplay, bringing the score to 48/2.\n\nDe Kock reached his half-century off 28 balls by the 10th over. Alongside Jayasuriya, he added 31 runs off Pat Cummins' first two overs, pushing Seattle to 98/2 after 11 overs. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the 12th over as both de Kock (62 off 33) and Jayasuriya (31 off 33) were dismissed in quick succession by Brody Couch.\n\nHassan Khan then delivered a decisive blow to Seattle Orcas, as he struck thrice in his two consecutive overs. He dismissed Heinrich Klaasen (8 off 8) in the 14th over, and Harmeet Singh (3 off 7) and Keemo Paul (0 off 1) in the 16th over, reducing Seattle to 116/7.\n\nIt was Shubham Ranjane, who came to the rescue as he played a crucial unbeaten knock of 26 runs off 25 balls, helping Seattle post a total of 152/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-0 (Ryan Rickelton - 0.1 ov), 2-1 (Aaron Jones - 0.3 ov), 3-98 (Quinton de Kock - 11.1 ov), 4-99 (Shehan Jayasuriya - 11.4 ov), 5-108 (Heinrich Klaasen - 13.1 ov), 6-116 (Harmeet Singh - 15.5 ov), 7-116 (Keemo Paul - 15.6 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Fall of wickets: 1-84 (Matthew Short - 6.4 ov), 2-98 (Finn Allen - 7.5 ov), 3-124 (Sanjay Krishnamurthi - 12.1 ov), 4-144 (Sherfane Rutherford - 13.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen\n\nMatthew Short\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nJosh Inglis(WK)\n\nSherfane Rutherford\n\nCorey Anderson(C)\n\nHassan Khan\n\nPat Cummins\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nCarmi le Roux\n\nBrody Couch\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nRyan Rickelton\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nAaron Jones\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nKeemo Paul\n\nImad Wasim\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nLungi Ngidi\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Sunday, July 21, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: San Francisco Unicorns elected to bowl",

Still, SFU will try to finish in top two to earn that extra chance of redemption.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nMeanwhile, the tournament is fairly over for the Seattle Orcas, as they are seated at the bottom of the table with only 2 points in five games.\n\nThe Orcas have failed to click this year, and their shortcomings were exposed in the previous four-wicket loss against Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nSeattle Orcas, despite a blazing 89 (52) knock from Ryan Rickleton, succumbed to a 142-run total in the first innings.\n\nHarmeet Singh and Keemo Paul tried their best to put a stoppage on the flow of runs in the chase.\n\nBut Unmukt Chand’s 62-run knock set the stage right for LAKR. They finished the chase with five balls to spare, leaving the Orcas in tatters.\n\nWith just two games left on the league schedule, the playoff dream is more or less lost for the Orcas.\n\nSF vs SEA: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSF vs SEA: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium features a hybrid pitch that provides a balanced playing field, catering to both batters and bowlers.\n\nThe pitch generally offers an even bounce. However, the degree of bounce can vary depending on weather conditions and the level of maintenance. 145-150 is the average first-innings score on this surface.\n\nSF vs SEA: Probable Playing XIs\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Finn Allen, Matthew Short, Josh Inglis (wk), Corey Anderson (c), Sherfane Rutherford, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Hassan Khan, Pat Cummins, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Brody Couch\n\nSeattle Orcas: Ryan Rickelton, Quinton de Kock (wk), Shehan Jayasuriya, Aaron Jones, Michael Bracewell, Heinrich Klaasen (c), Keemo Paul, Harmeet Singh, Cameron Gannon, Lungi Ngidi, Ali Sheikh\n\nSF vs SEA: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nSF vs SEA: Winner Prediction\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns are undoubtedly a stronger team compared to the Seattle Orcas, and hence, the former are the favourites to win this upcoming contest.",

I think the Duke ball in those conditions does talk a bit, it does move around and they have the resources to do that. As inexperienced as some of their players will be, we’ll still need to be on our A-game in all disciplines.\n\n“It will also be a good challenge where we also have newer faces, some inexperience within our team, to see how those guys go about their international careers within the red-ball space. That’s something that we’re looking forward to.\n\n“Every series is an important one. We don’t have the privilege of looking too far ahead with us being placed at No.7 (in the World Test Championship). It’s for us to look to play our best cricket in those conditions and take the confidence from that.\n\n“We know that winning breeds confidence and it can become a habit as well.\n\n“If we can start doing that in the West Indies, that would be good for us. But again, we’re not looking too far ahead. We want to get there, understanding that we haven’t played Test cricket for a while.\n\n“It’s about us reminding ourselves of our philosophy as a team, building that winning culture again and carrying that throughout the season.”\n\nWith Dean Elgar having called time on his career during the drawn series against India earlier this year, this means Bavuma is now the senior batter within the team with 97 innings under the belt.\n\nBavuma feels no added pressure.\n\n“It’s just an awareness in terms of knowing that you’re the senior statesman within the team and not an added pressure or anything like that,” he said.\n\n“I will still try to fulfil my role as a batter and put the team in winning positions. Nothing is going to change from that.”\n\nWith the likes of Aiden Markram and some of the Proteas T20 World Cup finalists set to join the Test side before the start of the Windies series, there will be some confidence that they will bring into the Test space.\n\n“There’s a lot of confidence that will emanate within the group seeing the success of the boys in the T20 side,” he said.\n\n“We’ll take the confidence that will come with the guys who were at the World Cup and have them lead things from that perspective.\n\n“But I think within the Test space we’re not as far ahead as the T20 players are and even the 50-over space. There are a couple of hurdles that we need to get through as a Test team.\n\n“We’re still finding ourselves, if we’re being honest. That’s really where our focus is within the Test team.”\n\nThe camp will run until Friday. The first Test is scheduled to start on August 7 in Port of Spain. It will be preceded by a warm-up match, starting on July 31.",

Shehan Jayasuriya's excellent catch sent San Francisco Unicorns batter Sanjay Krishnamurthi to the pavilion in the recent game.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns opted to bowl first at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Sunday, July 21 (India time). The Seattle Orcas scored 152 runs for the loss of seven wickets in 20 overs. Shehan Jayasuriya struggled to score runs as he was dismissed after scoring 31 runs off 33 deliveries with four boundaries.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns chased down the target with six wickets and more than five overs to spare. Opener Finn Allen scored 77 runs off 30 deliveries, including eight boundaries and six maximums. The Orcas recorded their fifth loss out of six matches in the tournament and are at the bottom of the six-team table.\n\nWatch: Shehan Jayasuriya Takes Catch of MLC 2024\n\nDuring the first ball of the 13th over of the San Francisco Unicorns' innings, Sanjay Krishnamurthi attempted a drive against a slower, wider delivery from left-arm spinner Harmeet Singh. Sanjay Krishnamurthi connected the ball but didn't get the desired elevation to go over the fielder inside the circle.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya was positioned at short cover on the field. The Sri Lankan international made a perfectly timed full-length jump to catch the ball with his outstretched right hand. Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed after scoring 10 runs off 16 balls with one boundary.\n\nWe Have Been Poor In This Season - Heinrich Klaasen\n\nThe Seattle Orcas were eliminated from the MLC 2024 after their heavy defeat to the San Francisco Unicorns.

They will face the Texas Super Kings (TSK) in their final match at the Grand Prairie Stadium on Wednesday, July 24.\n\nOrcas skipper Heinrich Klaasen expressed his disappointment, noting their poor batting and lack of firepower. Klaasen acknowledged that their total was 15-20 runs short, which ultimately cost them the match.\n\n\"Disappointing, we were in the final last year, this year we didn't bat well, not a lot of firepower. The bowlers were good and did what best they could do. A bit under par, maybe 15-20 runs short and that cost us in the end. We've been poor in this season, disappointing for the franchise and the owners,\" Klaasen said.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen's team has struggled with form and finding the right combination this season.

After winning the opening game of the season against the Seattle Orcas, they have lost three matches and one was washed out. This has put them fifth on the table with three points in five matches. Having not found a win in four games, MI needs to win this one to stay in contention for a top-four finish.\n\nOn the other hand, the San Francisco Unicorns are currently in the top four, in third place to be precise despite having five points in four matches.

Fast bowlers will find some movement, especially early in the inning.\n\nThe ball starts sticking to the pitch as the match proceeds, which might help medium pacers with a lot of variations. Quality spinners too can muddle the middle overs.\n\nMI New York Vs San Francisco Unicorns Weather Report\n\nThe skies will be cloudy with some chance of rain, but not too much, the winds will also hardly pick up.\n\nIt will be a warm and pleasant evening, with temperatures in the mid 20s.

So instead, we will look back at the recent record of these two teams, which has been fairly similar in this tournament. It is clear that both these sides do not compete with the better team this season, seeing how they have lost most of their matches by a big margin.\n\nIn their game earlier this season, the MI New York won their one and only match, this team also seems to have a better bowling attack as a whole. But, the Knight Riders have a better spin attack, giving them a distinct advantage on this dry track.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns also seem to have a better batting order, making them the favorites to win this one.\n\nMI New York Vs San Francisco Unicorns Prediction: San Francisco Unicorns will defeat MI New York in the 1st Match of Major League Cricket 2024",

    "body": "Major League Cricket 2024 is heading to its finale as the group phase matches are getting to its end. There was a massive injury scare that happened during the San Francisco Unicorns versus Seattle Orcas match.\n\nThe incident occurred when Carmi Le Roux, who was bowling to Ryan Rickelton, was hit on his head. The ball came towards the bowler at high speed and he couldn’t put up his hands on time and was hit on his head.\n\nThe rest of the players, including Ryan Rickelton, ran up to the bowler to check on his well-being. The bowler was badly injured as there was a lot of blood on his face. It was a gory sight to watch but the one positive that came out of it was that Carmi Le Roux was able to walk off the field on his own accord.\n\nMI New York on the verge of elimination\n\nMeanwhile, defending champions MI New York took on San Francisco Unicorn in a massive game on Thursday night. At the end of the game, the Unicorns managed to hold onto a three run win over the MI side.\n\nBatting first, the Unicorns scored 148/7 with skipper Corey Anderson top scoring with 59 not out. The knock came off 44 balls with four boundaries and two sixes as he added a crucial 87 runs for the 6th wicket with Hassan Khan who scored 44.\n\nChasing 149 to win, MI lost Ruben Clinton early for a duck. Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran then added 57 runs for the 2nd wicket. Dewald Brevis scored 56 runs from 36 balls before he was out to Brody Couch.\n\nMatthew Short was the best bowler with 3/27 from his 4 overs as he combined well with Hassan Khan and Brody Couch to help the Unicorns win by 3 runs. The result will have a massive bearing on the MI side who are struggling at the bottom half of the table and could miss out on the playoffs.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the game, Kieron Pollard the MI skipper said “I believe it was the middle period of 15 balls, we didn't get any boundaries and let them get back. But I think we still had a chance and didn't take it. I thought we bowled well to have them at 33 for 5, Boult bowled well, but they had a good partnership to get around 148. I think we should have restricted them to 120, I don't want to blame anyone, luck wasn't on our side at various stages of the tournament”",

The Unicorns scored 148/7, with Corey Anderson top-scoring with 59 not out, while MI New York's chase was hindered by the loss of Ruben Clinton early on and ultimately fell short of the target. The result puts MI New York's playoff hopes in jeopardy.\n\n**Key Performances**: Corey Anderson (59 not out) and Hassan Khan (44) had a crucial 87-run partnership for the Unicorns, while Matthew Short (3/27) was the best bowler for the Unicorns. Dewald Brevis scored 56 runs for MI New York.\n\n**Post-Match Reaction**: MI New York skipper Kieron Pollard attributed the loss to a 15-ball middle period where they failed to score boundaries, and also cited luck not being on their side throughout the tournament.",

    "body": "During a Major League Cricket match, fast-bowler Carmi le Roux suffered a frightening incident when he was struck in the head by a powerful shot from batter Ryan Rickelton. As le Roux was bowling his second over for the San Francisco Unicorns, a powerful shot from Seattle Orcas batter Rickelton caught the bowler by surprise and slammed directly into his head.\n\nThe vicious impact left le Roux’s face covered in blood, but remarkably the bowler remained conscious and walked off the field unassisted.\n\nIn the third over, South African bowler Le Roux was struck in the head by a powerful shot from his compatriot Rickelton. The southpaw, had intended to play the ball straight, but the shot ended up going directly towards the bowler.\n\nFortunately, le Roux was able to walk off the field under his own power, much to the relief of the medical staff and spectators.\n\nWith le Roux unavailable, former New Zealand and current USA all-rounder Corey Anderson stepped in to complete the over as the San Francisco Unicorns defended their total of 165 against the Seattle Orcas. Despite le Roux’s absence, the Unicorns were able to restrict the Orcas to just 142 runs.\n\nVeteran England pacer Liam Plunkett delivered an impressive performance, claiming 3/26 in his 4-over spell to emerge as the standout bowler.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas’ misfortunes continued as they suffered another defeat, this time to the Los Angeles Knight Riders, just two days after their previous loss. The back-to-back defeats have left the Orcas languishing at the bottom of the Major League Cricket (MLC) season two table – a stark contrast to their table-topping performance in the previous season.\n\nThe Orcas have only managed one win in their last five matches, putting them in a precarious position. Defending champions MI New York are also struggling, sitting fifth in the standings and outside of the playoff positions.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom continued their winning streak, securing a 42-run victory over the Texas Super Kings to remain at the top of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket points table.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nTexas Super Kings 164/10 (19.5 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom 206/5 (20 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom won by 42 runs.\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas witnessed a dominant performance, as Rachin Ravindra’s four wickets bowled out the Texan team for 164 runs. However, led by Faf du Plessis’ quickfire half-century – the fastest by a batter this season -- the Texas Super Kings had a strong start to their run-chase.\n\nDu Plessis propelled his team to 76 runs in the powerplay. However, Washington's bowlers executed a brilliant comeback in the middle overs. Jasdeep Singh, Glenn Maxwell, and Ravindra shared the 10 wickets among them, but it was Lockie Ferguson's crucial over to Du Plessis after the powerplay that turned the tide. Lockie conceded only 2 wides in that over, eventually leading to Faf's dismissal.\n\nSoon after, the Super Kings' batting lineup crumbled, losing 4 wickets for just 15 runs between overs 7.1 and 11.6, ultimately costing them the match. While Calvin Savage managed to strike a few powerful blows towards the end, it only served to narrow the margin of defeat.\n\nEarlier in the clash, Washington Freedom posted a formidable target of 206 for the Texas Super Kings. The fireworks began early with Travis Head delivering a scintillating performance in the powerplay. He hammered 53 runs off just 22 balls, dismantling the seamers with ease and giving Washington a flying start.\n\nAs spin was introduced, the scoring rate slowed slightly, thanks to some purchase on the used pitch. However, Maxwell played a pivotal role in maintaining the momentum, contributing crucial runs in the middle overs. Towards the tail end of the innings, Pienaar provided a valuable boost, ensuring a strong finish for the team.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Smith (57) also continued his consistent performances, nearly batting through the entire innings and securing a well-earned fifty. His steady presence at the crease anchored the Washington innings and kept the scoreboard ticking.\n\nThe start given by the two Australian batters was more than enough for the middle order of the Washington-based side to take on the rest of the bowlers. Maxwell (34) and Obus Pienaar (33) both scored crucial runs to ensure their team put up a tough target that the Texas Super Kings were eventually unable to chase down.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-59 (Travis Head - 4.3 ov), 2-74 (Andries Gous - 5.6 ov), 3-79 (Rachin Ravindra - 6.5 ov), 4-137 (Glenn Maxwell - 13.5 ov), 5-186 (Steven Smith - 18.5 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-37 (Devon Conway - 3.3 ov), 2-90 (Aaron Hardie - 7.1 ov), 3-96 (Joshua Tromp - 9.4 ov), 4-98 (Faf du Plessis - 10.5 ov), 5-105 (Milind Kumar - 11.6 ov), 6-132 (Marcus Stoinis - 14.6 ov), 7-141 (Dwayne Bravo - 15.5 ov), 8-161 (Mohammad Mohsin - 17.5 ov), 9-163 (Noor Ahmad - 19.3 ov), 10-164 (Calvin Savage - 19.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nNoor Ahmad\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nTravis Head\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nAmila Aponso\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nJasdeep Singh\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Saturday, July 20, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas",

    "body": "MLC 2024: Washington Freedom beat Texas Super Kings by 42 runs in Match 17 of the Major League Cricket 2024, as the Steve Smith-led side extend their 'invincible' run in the tournament to 6 matches. Washington Freedom have won 5 out of their 6 matches, as the fixture against Texas Super Kings earlier in the tournament was abandoned due to rain.\n\nWashington Freedom Vs Texas Super Kings MLC 2024 Match 17 Highlights\n\nElecting to bowl first, the Texas Super Kings did not do justice to their decision, as the in-form opening pair of Steve Smith and Travis Head were off to a flying start, and the duo notched up 59 runs in 4.2 overs before the latter fell prey to Noor Ahmed. The partnership was indeed, a hilarious one, as Travis Head scored 53 runs out of those 59 runs, whereas, Steve Smith faced merely 5 balls, and scored 4 runs.\n\nTexas Super Kings made a mini-comeback of their own, as Travis Head's departure was followed by quick dismissals of Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra inside the next 20 runs, ad Washington Freedom were reeling at 79/3 in 7 overs.\n\nThe small stutter did not halt the scoring rate, as the Australian duo of Glenn Maxwell and Steve Smith notched up a 58-run stand to resurrect the innings before Glenn Maxwell departed on the score of 138.

Despite a shaky start, Anderson's composure helped his team post a competitive total of 148/7. Hassan Khan's valuable 44 complemented Anderson's effort, particularly their crucial 87-run partnership which salvaged the innings after early setbacks.\n\nThe Unicorns' innings began poorly, with Noshtush Kenjige wreaking havoc by dismissing Finn Allen (0) and Matthew Short (4) early on. Further losses of Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis left the team struggling at 28/4 by the end of the powerplay.\n\nSherfane Rutherford's brief 15 gave some momentum before being run out. Rashid Khan's dismissal of Hassan Khan in the 17th over and Trent Boult's double strikes kept MI New York in contention. However, Anderson's steady half-century ensured the Unicorns had a defensible score.\n\nIn response, MI New York's chase had a turbulent start as Matthew Short claimed the wicket of Ruben Clinton (0) in the second over. Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran then steadied the ship, taking MI New York to 31/1 at the end of the powerplay. Brevis was particularly impressive, reaching his half-century in just 32 balls with an aggressive display against Pat Cummins.\n\nDespite Brevis' heroics, MI New York's middle order crumbled under pressure. Brody Couch's twin strikes to remove Brevis and captain Kieron Pollard (4) shifted the momentum. Matthew Short further dented MI New York's chase by dismissing Pooran (26).\n\nAs the run rate escalated, Romario Shepherd and Monank Patel fell cheaply, leaving Rashid Khan and Heath Richards with a daunting task. Cummins' tight 19th over, conceding just five runs, was instrumental in tightening the screws.\n\nThe final over, bowled by Haris Rauf, saw a valiant effort from Heath Richards, who nearly pulled off a miraculous chase by hitting two sixes. However, his dismissal on the last ball sealed a dramatic win for the Unicorns.\n\nThe thrilling contest showcased exceptional performances on both sides but ultimately highlighted the importance of composure under pressure. Corey Anderson's stability with the bat and Pat Cummins' crucial bowling proved decisive in a match that kept spectators on the edge of their seats until the final delivery.\n\nBrief Scores\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns 148/7 (Corey Anderson 59*, Hassan Khan 44; Noshtush Kenjige 2/13, Trent Boult 2/35) beat MI New York 145/7 (Dewald Brevis 56, Nicholas Pooran 26; Matthew Short 3/27, Brody Couch 2/27)",

The ball, slightly short in length, came onto Brevis’ bat, and he smashed the ball with his might towards long-on, soaring over the boundary for six runs.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Shehan Jayasuriya hits an unorthodox shot against Haris Rauf in MLC 2024\n\nMatch Summary\n\nEarlier, the Unicorns batted first, scoring 148 runs for seven wickets in their 20 overs. After a shaky start at 33/5, Corey Anderson led the recovery with a stellar performance, scoring 59 runs off 37 balls. He formed a crucial partnership of 87 runs with Hassan Khan, who contributed 44 runs off 35 balls. The New York bowlers, particularly Nosthush Kenjige and Trent Boult, took two wickets each, while Short also made an impact with three wickets for 27 runs.\n\nChasing a target of 149, New York scored 145 runs for seven wickets. Brevis stood out for MI, scoring 56 runs off 36 balls. Despite a solid partnership with Nicholas Pooran (26 runs off 30 balls), MI New York struggled to maintain momentum, losing wickets at critical moments. Haris Rauf‘s bowling proved decisive, taking the final wicket to secure the win for the Unicorns. This victory marks a significant achievement for the San Francisco Unicorns, who secured their place in the playoffs and moved to second place in the league standings. Meanwhile, New York faced their fourth consecutive loss of the season.",

    "body": "In the 16th match of Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC), United States of America cricketer Nosthush Kenjige showcased his exceptional fielding skills with a brilliant caught-and-bowled dismissal of Finn Allen. The match, held between MI New York and San Francisco Unicorns, saw Kenjige make a significant impact right from the start.\n\nNosthush Kenjige’s breathtaking catch\n\nOn the third ball of the first over, Kenjige delivered a short-length delivery directed towards the wicket. Allen, opting for a backfoot shot, attempted to muscle the ball down the ground. However, he failed to generate the necessary power and elevation, and the ball dribbled straight back toward the bowler. Demonstrating exceptional agility and presence of mind, Kenjige stretched out to his right and made a spectacular catch, sending Allen back to the pavilion for just 2 runs. This stunning catch not only highlighted Kenjige’s skill as a bowler but also showcased his impressive fielding abilities.\n\nKenjige’s performance didn’t stop there. He was instrumental in dismissing both opening batters of the San Francisco Unicorns, taking the wicket of Matthew Short along with Allen. Over his four overs, Kenjige maintained an impressive economy rate of 3.20, conceding only 13 runs and securing 2 wickets.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Shehan Jayasuriya hits an unorthodox shot against Haris Rauf in MLC 2024\n\nDespite the exceptional efforts of Kenjige and the MI New York bowlers, the team fell short in their chase. San Francisco Unicorns, batting first, posted a total of 148/7. The standout performance came from their skipper, Corey Anderson, who played a pivotal role with a brilliant half-century, scoring 59 runs off 37 balls, including 4 fours and 2 sixes. His innings set a challenging target of 149 runs for MI New York.\n\nIn response, MI New York managed to score 145/7, narrowly missing the target by just 3 runs. Dewald Brevis contributed significantly with 56 runs off 36 balls, but the rest of the batting lineup failed to rise to the occasion, leading to their defeat.",

    "body": "The stage is set for a crucial encounter in the Major League Cricket 2024 as the San Francisco Unicorns lock horns with the Seattle Orcas in the 13th T20 match. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide who might emerge victorious:\n\nUnicorns with a Slight Edge\n\nWhile both teams haven’t exactly set the tournament on fire, the Unicorns (currently ranked 4th) appear to have a slight advantage over the struggling Orcas (anchored at the bottom). Here’s why:\n\nRecent Form: The Unicorns might have only one win in three matches, but their Net Run Rate (-0.631) is significantly better than the Orcas’ (-1.007). This indicates closer contests for the Unicorns.\n\nBatting Power: Players like Finn Allen, Corey Anderson, and Sherfane Rutherford in the Unicorns’ batting line-up pose a serious threat, especially early on.\n\nOrcas Can’t be Counted Out\n\nHowever, writing off the Orcas would be a mistake. Here’s why they might pull off an upset:\n\nHome Advantage: The match takes place at Church Street Park, Morrisville, which could potentially favor the Orcas if they’re familiar with the pitch conditions.\n\nBowling X-Factor: The likes of Nauman Anwar, Harmeet Singh, and Zaman Khan in the Orcas’ bowling attack have the potential to disrupt the Unicorns’ batting rhythm.\n\nMatch Prediction\n\nWhile the Unicorns seem to have a slight edge on paper, expect a close encounter. The final result might hinge on individual brilliance and handling pressure situations. Cricketwebs predicts a narrow victory for the Unicorns (winning probability: 69%), but the Orcas have the potential to cause an upset.\n\nWinner: San Francisco Unicorns Will Win\n\nRemember: Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties. Enjoy the match!",

    "body": "Right then, that will be it from us for this contest. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. The action continues at the Major League Cricket, 2024. The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the Washington Freedom in Match 17 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas. That game will be played on July 20th and will start at 6.00 am IST (12.30 am GMT). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nThe skipper of San Francisco Unicorns is also the Player of the Match for his sublime knock. He says that he is pretty happy with the win. Adds that they bat deep and credits Hassan Khan who batted superbly today. Mentions that they need to pick the aggressive options and find the boundary when they can. Shares that he and Hassan Khan spoke well through the middle and got ahead of the game in the latter stages with the bat. Adds that he is happy to perform against the MINY side. Ends by sharing that they were under par with the bat but the guys showed a good fight and it shows the character of the team.\n\nThe losing skipper of MI New York, Kieron Pollard says the middle phase with the ball was the one where the opposition got back in the game but they had it covered for a long while with the bat but they gave it away in the end. Adds that around 120 was what they had in mind after their bowling in the first 10 overs but the opposition batted well and posted above 145 making things difficult for them. Says that one has to congratulate the opposition and not try to take credit away from them as they played better on the day. Says that he hasn't done justice to the side himself with his batting not firing and that has cost the team for the majority of the tournament. Closes by saying that the batting unit has not done well throughout the tournament and overall as a batting unit they have let the fans and franchise down but they still have one game to go and they'll look to play that well.\n\nMatthew Short is up for a chat. He says it's a huge win as MI New York is a quality side and they have some brilliant players of T20 format. Credits Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan for that superb partnership that kept them in the game. Mentions that the top order has done well so far apart from today and the middle order stepped up when the side needed them the most and that's a good sign for any side.\n\nEarlier today, the San Francisco Unicorns opted to bat first and posted a fighting score of 148 for 7 in their 20 overs. The Unicorns were reeling at 33 for 5 but the partnership of 87 between skipper Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan (44 off 35) brought them back in the game. Corey Anderson remained unbeaten on 59 off just 37 and played a crucial hand to get his side out of trouble. Nosthush Kenjige and Trent Boult took two each for the MI New York side while Shepherd and Rashid Khan chipped in with one apiece. MI New York have slumped to their fourth loss of the season and have just a game in hand.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns started well with the ball but lost their way in the middle phase of the innings. They, however, came back strong and got into the winning position. Brody Couch and Matthew Short shared five wickets among them while Haris Rauf and Hassan Khan chipped with one apiece. San Francisco Unicorns will be delighted with the win as they came back from behind and took the victory from the jaws of defeat. San Francisco Unicorns have qualified for the playoffs and moved to second position in the table.\n\nPhew! What a cliffhanger we've witnessed in Dallas! San Francisco Unicorns held their nerves and won this game by 3 runs in the end. They become the second team after the Washington Freedom to book a place in the playoffs. Chasing a competitive score of 149 for the win, MI New York lost an early wicket of Ruben Clinton but Pooran and Brevis stuck around and added 77 for the second wicket. Dewald Brevis made an attacking fifty and departed on 56 off 36. The wicket of Brevis put the brakes on scoring for MI New York and they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Rashid Khan and Heath Richards swung their bats at the backend but failed to take their team over the line.\n\nW\n\nOvers15.4\n\nScore104 - 5\n\nMatthew Short to Romario Shepherd, HOLES OUT! The plan comes off for the Unicorns and Matthew Short gets his third wicket of the match. Comes from round the wicket and bowls it a touch shorter, sliding into the middle. Romario Shepherd looks to bang bang but does not get the desired connection. He gets the height but not distance and gets caught by Hassan Khan at the deep mid-wicket boundary. MI New York have lost half their side now.",

The close contest highlighted the competitive nature of the league, with the Unicorns managing to secure a hard-fought victory.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nMI New York vs San Francisco Unicorns, Match 16\n\nMI New York 145/7 (20 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns 148/7 (20 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns won by 3 runs.\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns secured a thrilling three-run victory over MI New York in a nail-biting encounter of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas.\n\nKey performances included Corey Anderson’s (59*) steady half-century for the Unicorns, Dewald Brevis’ (56) explosive fifty for MI New York, and Pat Cummins’ crucial 19th over for the Unicorns, which helped them defend their total of 148/7, despite Heath Richards’ (23) valiant effort in the final over for MI New York.\n\nMI New York had a staggered start to the run chase as they lost Ruben Clinton (0) to Matthew Short as early as the second over. Opener Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran (26) saw out the powerplay, with MI New York at 31/1.\n\nWhile the required run rate had crept up, MI New York were set for a comfortable run chase with nine wickets in hand. Brevis looked to pick up the pace after the powerplay and found boundaries at will. The 21-year-old brought up his half-century in the ninth over, smashing Pat Cummins for a six and a four to reach the milestone in just 32 balls.\n\nIn the very next over, Brody Couch bagged the crucial wicket of Brevis with the score reading 79/2. Captain Pollard (4) was the next man to fall, trapped LBW by Couch as well. With the required run rate rising, Matthew Short made a vital breakthrough with the wicket of Pooran in the 14th over.\n\nRomario Shepherd (7) and Monank Patel (5) both fell with minimal contributions, leaving MI New York’s Rashid Khan (14*) and Heath Richards with a steep target in the final four overs of the game. Pat Cummins bowled a crucial 19th over, giving away only 5 runs, which was vital for his team’s defense of the total. In the final over, Heath Richards nearly chased the 20 runs needed with two maximums, but Haris Rauf managed to dismiss him on the final delivery, securing a three-run victory for the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns had a dismal start to their innings. In quick succession, they lost Finn Allen (0) and Matthew Short (4) to the bowling of Noshtush Kenjige, while Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis were also sent back to the pavilion early. By the end of the powerplay, the Unicorns were languishing at 28/4.\n\nSherfane Rutherford (15) struck three boundaries before he was run out in the seventh over. It was Hassan Khan (44) and Corey Anderson who executed the repair job for the San Francisco Unicorns. The pair put on 87 runs in 58 balls, with Corey Anderson leading the way with a 33-ball half-century.\n\nHassan Khan fell in the 17th over when he was cleaned up by the crafty Rashid Khan. Pat Cummins (13) joined Corey Anderson and made a brief contribution before becoming Boult’s second scalp of the day. The San Francisco Unicorns finished on 148/7 in 20 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-2 (Finn Allen - 0.3 ov), 2-7 (Sanjay Krishnamurthi - 1.5 ov), 3-7 (Matthew Short - 2.2 ov), 4-19 (Josh Inglis - 5.2 ov), 5-33 (Sherfane Rutherford - 6.6 ov), 6-120 (Hassan Khan - 16.4 ov), 7-145 (Pat Cummins - 19.4 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Fall of wickets: 1-2 (Ruben Clinton - 1.5 ov), 2-79 (Dewald Brevis - 9.6 ov), 3-88 (Kieron Pollard - 12.4 ov), 4-94 (Nicholas Pooran - 13.4 ov), 5-104 (Romario Shepherd - 15.4 ov), 6-108 (Monank Patel - 16.1 ov), 7-145 (Heath Richards - 19.6 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nMI New York\n\nRuben Clinton\n\nMonank Patel\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nDewald Brevis\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nRomario Shepherd\n\nSunny Patel\n\nHeath Richards\n\nRashid Khan\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nTrent Boult\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen\n\nMatthew Short\n\nJosh Inglis(WK)\n\nCorey Anderson(C)\n\nSherfane Rutherford\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nHassan Khan\n\nPat Cummins\n\nLiam Plunkett\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nBrody Couch\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Friday, July 19, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: San Francisco Unicorns elected to bat",

    "body": "Los Angeles Knight Riders beat Seattle Orcas by 4 wickets, in MLC Match 15 , today, at Church Street Park, Morrisville, USA\n\nMatch Summary\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Los Angeles Knight Riders, Match 15, Major League Cricket\n\nSeattle Orcas 142/6 (20 ov)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders 143/6 (19.1 ov)\n\nResult - Los Angeles Knight Riders won by 4 wickets\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nA crucial half-century from Unmukt Chand (62) ensured the Los Angeles Knight Riders defeated the Seattle Orcas by four wickets and five balls to spare in the 15th match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Church Street Park, Morrisville on Wednesday. Ryan Rickelton’s (89) breathtaking 52-ball knock for the Seattle Orcas was ultimately in vain.\n\nChasing a below-par score, the Los Angeles Knight Riders orchestrated a comfortable run chase. Sunil Narine’s (8) lean run continued when Spencer Johnson dismissed him in the second over, while Jason Roy (26) and Unmukt Chand (62) went on to build an important partnership. At the end of the powerplay, the Los Angeles Knight Riders were 47/1.\n\nThe 58-run alliance between Roy and Chand was derailed by Harmeet Singh in the 10th over. Unmukt Chand went on to bring up his half-century in 38 deliveries, comprising three sixes and three fours. In the 17th over, Chand fell to Harmeet Singh, but at 120/5, the Knight Riders were in a strong position.\n\nNitish Kumar (12) and Saif Badar (18*) came together for a brief partnership before Andre Russell (10) made a quick contribution to ensure the Los Angeles Knight Riders secured victory with balls to spare. Harmeet Singh (2/27) and Cameron Gannon (2/35) were the pick of the Orcas bowling efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Seattle Orcas suffered an early setback when Shehan Jayasuriya (2) was dismissed by Corne Dry. Soon after, Quinton de Kock (0) was run out without troubling the scorers. Opener Ryan Rickelton continued his fine form and quickly accumulated runs as he was joined by Heinrich Klaasen. By the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 36/2, with Rickelton having scored 27 of those runs.\n\nIn the ninth over, Rickelton shifted into another gear, hammering Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a 22-run over. Remarkably, no other batsman besides Rickelton had scored a boundary for the Orcas in the first 10 overs. Rickelton brought up his half-century in just 28 deliveries, featuring five maximums and four boundaries. Meanwhile, Klaasen (23) played a more guarded knock, providing stability at the other end until he was unfortunately run out in the 12th over at 90/3.\n\nWhile Rickelton continued to flourish, striking another six and four fours, the lack of support around him meant the Orcas failed to build any more concrete partnerships. Aaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were castled by the experienced Sunil Narine and Andre Russell before Rickelton would eventually perish just shy of a century, dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over. The Seattle Orcas finished on 142/6 in 20 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-24 (Shehan Jayasuriya - 3.2 ov), 2-26 (Quinton de Kock - 3.6 ov), 3-90 (Heinrich Klaasen - 11.6 ov), 4-113 (Aaron Jones - 15.4 ov), 5-121 (Michael Bracewell - 17.3 ov), 6-135 (Ryan Rickelton - 18.5 ov)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Fall of wickets: 1-13 (Sunil Narine - 2.2 ov), 2-71 (Jason Roy - 9.5 ov), 3-83 (David Miller - 11.1 ov), 4-105 (Nitish Kumar - 13.5 ov), 5-120 (Unmukt Chand - 16.4 ov), 6-140 (Andre Russell - 18.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XIs\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nRyan Rickelton\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nAaron Jones\n\nMichael Bracewell\n\nKeemo Paul\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nLungi Ngidi\n\nAli Sheikh\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nJason Roy\n\nSunil Narine(C)\n\nUnmukt Chand(WK)\n\nDavid Miller\n\nAndre Russell\n\nSaif Badar\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nCorne Dry\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nAli Khan\n\nWaqar Salamkheil\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Wednesday, July 17, 2024 20:00\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville\n\nToss: Seattle Orcas elected to bat",

The Unicorns won the game.\n\nNY vs SF Pitch Report\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas will likely remain balanced throughout this match. The pitch at will be good for batting, however in the previous games we have seen the spinners getting a bit of assistance from the wicket.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium Ground Stats (MLC 2024)\n\nMatches: 6\n\nMatches won batting first: 3\n\nMatches won batting second: 3\n\nAverage first innings total: 163\n\nAverage second innings total: 144\n\nHighest recorded total: 182/5 by Washington Freedoms vs MI New York\n\nLowest recorded total: 88/10 by MI New York vs Washington Freedom\n\nFantasy value from the pitch report\n\nTop-order batters and big-hitters will be good picks for the fantasy contests.\n\nAs far as the bowlers are concerned, go for the fast bowlers from both sides.\n\nAll-rounders with good spin bowling will be rewarding.\n\nNY vs SF Fantasy Cricket Tips\n\nMI New York Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nNicholas Pooran has been in brilliant touch with the bat and will be a must-pick for the game. Besides Pooran, Monank Patel and Romario Shepherd could also be good picks.\n\nRashid Khan will be a great choice as he will be potent on this track with the ball and can also contribute with the bat.\n\nTrent Boult's potential with the new ball makes him a good choice for the fantasy contests.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nMatthew Short and Finn Allen are the in form batters for the Unicorns, and these two would be the safer picks from SFU's batting.\n\nLiam Plunkett, Hassan Khan and Pat Cummins could be the best choices from the Unicorns bowling attack.\n\nNY vs SF Winner Prediction\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns look like a much more balanced and well-rounded team, and as per their performance this season, they are the favourites to win the game.\n\nNY vs SF Top Player Picks\n\nNicholas Pooran (NY)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 111 Runs in 4 Matches\n\nThe West Indian keeper batter is the leading run-scorer for MI New York and has scored 111 runs in three matches at an average of 37.00 and a strike rate of 144.16. Nicholas Pooran will be one of the safest picks for the fantasy contests.\n\nRashid Khan (NY)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 88 Runs and 6 Wickets in 4 Matches\n\nThe Afghan all-rounder is in excellent form currently. Rashid Khan has been a consistent wicket-taker for MINY this season and has also contributed with important runs with the bat lower down the order, which makes him an important choice for the fantasy contests.\n\nMatt Short (SF)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 147 Runs in 3 Matches\n\nThe Australian opening-batter has played three games in the completion so far and has scored two half-centuries in them. With the ability to give his side a solid start, Matt Short can trouble the opposition bowlers and take his team to a comfortable position single-handedly.\n\nLiam Plunkett (SF)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 5 Wickets in 3 Matches\n\nThe English bowler, Liam Plunkett is consistently picking-up wickets for his team in MLC 2024. His current form makes him a good option for the fantasy contests.\n\nNY vs SF Differential Picks\n\nTrent Boult (NY)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 25 Runs and 5 Wickets in 4 Matches\n\nThe Kiwi pacer, Trent Boult is always a lethal customer with the new ball and this gives him the opportunity to be amongst the wickets giving you important points.\n\nFinn Allen (SF)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 107 Runs in 3 Matches\n\nThe Kiwi opener, Finn Allen has been excellent so far in this tournament. However, Allen sometimes suffers from inconsistency and hence is kept in the differential picks section.\n\nNY vs SF Fantasy Expert Advice\n\nConsidering the conditions and probable-XIs, a combination of 2-3-3-3 or 1-3-4-3 would be ideal for this fixture.\n\nNY vs SF Fantasy Team for Head-to-Head/Small Leagues\n\nWicketkeepers: Nicholas Pooran, Monank Patel\n\nBatters: Kieron Pollard, Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk\n\nAll-rounders: Matt Short, Rashid Khan, Hassan Khan\n\nBowlers: Trent Boult, Liam Plunkett, Brody Couch\n\nCaptain: Finn Allen\n\nVice-captain: Rashid Khan\n\nMI New York: 5 Players; San Francisco Unicorns: 6 Players\n\nNY vs SF Fantasy Team for Winner Takes All/ Grand Leagues\n\nWicketkeepers: Nicholas Pooran\n\nBatters: Kieron Pollard, Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk\n\nAll-rounders: Matt Short, Rashid Khan, Hassan Khan, Romario Shepherd\n\nBowlers: Trent Boult, Liam Plunkett, Brody Couch\n\nCaptain: Matt Short\n\nVice-captain: Nicholas Pooran",

    "body": "LAKR all-rounder Andre Russell struck one of his trademark straight sixes, in the ending parts of the Major League Cricket 2024 match between Los Angeles Knight Riders and Seattle Orcas in Morrisville. At that point, LAKR had lost their fifth wicket while chasing a target of 143, needing 23 runs off the remaining 20 deliveries when Russell came in to bat.\n\nWith a towering six, the 36-year-old sealed the game by launching a slower leg-cutter from Cameron Gannon straight onto the sightscreen. This decisive shot brought the score to 11 off 11, effectively coming close to the victory.\n\nEven though he was eventually out for 10 off 7 after two balls, the thunderous hit had already done the damage.\n\nLAKR secured victory by four wickets after Russell’s dismissal on the first ball of the final over. With one match left in the round-robin phase, this victory maintained their chances of making the playoffs, placing them in fourth position with five points from six games.\n\nIn the tournament so far, Russell has been inconsistent, scoring 94 runs at a modest average of 23.50 and a high strike rate of 159.32 across five innings. The 36-year-old all-rounder has also struggled to take wickets, claiming just one scalp with figures of 1/15 in four overs in this match.\n\nNeeding a win to keep their playoff hopes alive, LAKR took on SOR. Russell, breaking out of his wicket-taking slump, delivered a sensational spell of 1/15 in 4 overs, restricting SOR to a modest total of 142/6 in 20 overs.\n\nIn the 18th over, he dismissed the dangerous Michael Bracewell, stalling SOR’s late surge. Later, Russell’s crucial six helped LAKR end their three-game losing streak and secure the victory.\n\nA victory over MI New York (MINY) in their final round-robin matchup would all but secure a playoff spot. The two teams are set to face off in Dallas on Sunday, July 21.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom will be eager to book a place in the top two of the Major League Cricket 2024 standings when they meet Texas Super Kings in a top-of-the-table clash at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Friday.\n\nOur match against TSK on July 19 is scheduled to start at 7:30 PM CT (July 20, 6:00 AM IST). The MLC 2024 game will be available to watch via live streaming and broadcast.\n\nThe top two teams in the points table after the group stage will meet each other in the Qualifier, with the winning team getting a chance to directly advance to the final.\n\nCurrently, we are on top of the MLC 2024 points table with nine points from five games. A win will help us continue our unbeaten run this season along with guaranteeing a place in the top two of the standings.\n\nWe defeated MI New York by a mammoth 94 runs in our last game in Dallas on Tuesday, with Jasdeep Singh making a memorable debut for us in MLC with a three-wicket haul. Travis Head and Andries Gous also shone with half-centuries.\n\nThough Saurabh Netravalkar did not feature in our last match, he continues to be on top of the bowling charts for MLC 2024. The left-arm pacer has 12 wickets from four matches at an average of 9.16 and a strike rate of 7.66. Lockie Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell also feature in the top five of the wicket-takers list with nine and six wickets, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Travis Head, after scoring consecutive fifties in the last two matches, is on top of our run-getters list, with captain Steve Smith in second place. Head has accumulated 141 runs at an average of 35.25 and a strike rate of 163.95 to find a place in the top ten of the overall batting charts, along with Smith.\n\nWF vs TSK form in MLC\n\nWe enter this game with four wins from the last five matches in MLC 2024, with our previous game against Texas Super Kings getting washed off due to rain.\n\nWashington Freedom's last five matches\n\nOpponent\n\nVenue\n\nResult\n\nMatch Date\n\nMargin\n\nMINY\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\n94 runs\n\nLAKR\n\nMorrisville\n\nWon\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\n8 wickets\n\nSO\n\nDallas\n\nWon\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\n5 wickets\n\nTSK\n\nMorrisville\n\nNo Result\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\n-\n\nMINY\n\nMorrisville\n\nWon\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\n4 runs (DLS)\n\nWF vs TSK, MLC 2024: Players to watch out\n\nJasdeep Singh, who came into the side as a replacement for Netravalkar in our last match against MINY, made an instant impact with career-best T20 figures of 3/14 in three overs. He was a tricky customer, surprising batters with his pace and bounce.\n\nJasdeep bowled 13 dot balls in his spell, piling pressure on the MINY middle order, who succumbed to the rising scoring rate. Ferguson also chipped in with two crucial wickets to skittle MINY.\n\nMeanwhile, Andries Gous scored his first fifty in MLC to anchor our batting and powered us to a dominant total of 182/5 batting first. Coming in to bat during the powerplay, Gous scored 59 off 48 balls before being dismissed on the last ball of the innings.\n\nThe fact that three of Gous’ four sixes came against leg spinner Rashid Khan speaks to his class and big-hitting ability. Travis Head displayed his attacking game yet again with a 33-ball 54 to give us a steady start and a solid foundation to go big in the death overs.\n\nThe Australian duo of Head and Smith were severe on the Texas Super Kings bowling attack chasing 204, in their last meeting on July 9. But unfortunately, rain played spoilsport as we were well-placed at 62/0 after just four overs.\n\nWashington Freedom squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs TSK MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nLIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs Texas Super Kings match will be available on Monumental Sports Network and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA.

    "body": "BY Kyle Marie McMahon\n\nCognizant Major League Cricket (MLC) opened its 2024 season in Morrisville on July 5. Despite the sweltering heat, the community packed Church Street Park (5800 Cricket Pitch Way) to watch MI New York defeat the Seattle Orcas by six wickets.\n\nThis is just the second season for MLC, which has six teams. MI New York won the inaugural title last year, and while the players hope for a repeat, Head Coach Robin Peterson says, “Last year is last year. Yes, it’s nice to come into a tournament as defending champions, but everybody starts on no points again. We’re very cognizant of the fact we’ve got to go and earn it again and play some good cricket if we’re going to be successful in this competition.”\n\nMLC is a Twenty20 league, which is a shortened format of cricket, designed to be played in a few hours rather than five days. If you are new to the sport, the rules may feel intimidating, but upon arrival, the league provides you with a handout to explain the scoring. For those familiar with baseball, it can be helpful to use it as a comparison for understanding the basics.\n\nAs in baseball, there is a fielding team and a batting team. Imagine the area from home plate to the pitcher’s mound. In cricket, this is called the pitch. There is still a pitcher (called a bowler) and a catcher (called a wicket-keeper), but instead of bases, cricket has “wickets,” which are three stumps with connecting sticks on top. The remainder of the fielding team is in the circular field that surrounds the pitch. The fielding team’s goal is to dismiss batters (get an out), which can be done by breaking the wickets or fielding the ball.\n\nThe batting team’s goal is to protect the wicket and hit the ball for runs. Two batters take the pitch at a time, standing at opposite wickets. Only one batter will hit the ball, but both will run, and each time they cross the pitch to the opposite wicket, a run is scored. As with all sports, there are special rules around batting, fielding and scoring, but you don’t need to know them all to start enjoying the game.\n\nAnd with continued investment in Church Street Park, you can expect interest in the sport to continue to grow. Harmeet Singh Baddhan, bowler for the Orcas, loves getting to play here. He says, “Every time we come here, it’s such good hospitality. People love cricket out here. It’s a smaller community, but there’s a lot of love for the game.”\n\nIt’s been an exciting and tight race this season, which was expanded to 21 matches, up from 15 last season. Washington Freedom is in first place with seven points, but there are still plenty of games to play. You can still catch the last game in North Carolina on July 17 at 3 p.m. before the season wraps in Grand Prairie, Texas. The round-robin playoffs will start July 24, with the championship game commencing on July 28 at Grand Prairie Stadium. Don’t stress if you weren’t able to make it to a game: the Minor League Cricket season, where you can watch our very own Morrisville Raptors play at Church Street Park, will start soon after.",

The nasty blow left le Roux’s face completely bloodied. Thankfully, le Roux was still in his senses despite the hit, and walked off without any help from his teammates.\n\nBowling the third over of the game, South African Le Roux was smashed on the head by a shot from compatriot Rickleton. Rickleton, a left-hander, had looked to hit it straight, but the shot ended up going straight at the bowler.\n\nWatch: Scary moment in MLC as Carmi le Roux gets hit on the head\n\nMedical staff were rushed on to the ground, but to everyone’s relief, le Roux was able to walk off on his own.\n\nSeattle Orcas at the bottom\n\nAfter le Roux was taken off, former New Zealand and current USA all-rounder Corey Anderson completed the over. Defending 165, the San Francisco Unicorns were able to restrict Seattle Orcas to just 142, despite missing le Roux.\n\nFormer England pacer Liam Plunkett, 39, was the pick of the bowlers, ending the game with figures of 3/26 in four overs.\n\nAfter that game, the Seattle Orcas suffered another defeat two days later, this time to the Los Angeles Knight Riders.

    "body": "Cricket\n\n-OneArabia\n\nUnmukt Chand's crucial half-century (62) led the Los Angeles Knight Riders to a four-wicket victory over the Seattle Orcas in match 15 of Major League Cricket 2024 at Church Street Park, Morrisville. The win came with five balls remaining on Wednesday (July 17).\n\nDespite Ryan Rickelton's impressive 89 off 52 balls for the Seattle Orcas, his efforts were in vain. The Los Angeles Knight Riders secured their second win in six games, moving to fourth place on the points table. Washington Freedom has already qualified for the playoffs.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders chased a below-par score comfortably. Sunil Narine's lean run continued as Spencer Johnson dismissed him in the second over. However, Jason Roy (26) and Unmukt Chand (62) formed a vital partnership, taking the team to 47/1 by the end of the powerplay.\n\nThe partnership between Roy and Chand added 58 runs before Harmeet Singh broke it in the 10th over. Chand reached his half-century in 38 balls, hitting three sixes and three fours. Although he fell to Harmeet Singh in the 17th over, leaving LAKR at 120/5, they remained in control.\n\nEarlier, Seattle Orcas faced early setbacks when Corne Dry dismissed Shehan Jayasuriya (2), followed by Quinton de Kock's run-out without scoring. By the end of the powerplay, they were at 36/2, with Rickelton contributing 27 runs.\n\nRickelton accelerated in the ninth over, smashing Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a single over. He reached his half-century off just 28 balls with five sixes and four boundaries.\n\nLack of Support for Rickelton\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (23) provided some stability but was run out in the 12th over at 90/3. Despite Rickelton's continued aggression, hitting another six and four boundaries, other batsmen failed to support him adequately.\n\nAaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were bowled by Sunil Narine and Andre Russell respectively. Rickelton was eventually dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over, leaving Seattle Orcas at 142/6 after their allotted overs.\n\nFinal Push by LAKR\n\nNitish Kumar (12) and Saif Badar (18*) formed a brief partnership before Andre Russell contributed a quickfire 10 runs. This ensured that Los Angeles Knight Riders achieved their target with balls to spare. Harmeet Singh (2/27) and Cameron Gannon (2/35) were notable performers for Seattle Orcas.\n\nBrief Score:\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders:143/6(Unmukt Chand 62, Jason Roy 27; Harmeet Singh 2/27, Cameron Gannon 2/25)Seattle Orcas:142/6(Ryan Rickelton 82, Heinrich Klaasen 23; Corne Dry 1/8, Andre Russell 1/15)Result:Los Angeles Knight Riders won by four wickets\n\nStory first published: Thursday, July 18, 2024, 13:24 [GST]",

    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nLeague leading Washington Freedom, captained by Steve Smith, come into their fourth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket campaign on the back of one game with no result due to the weather and two victories thus far. The Los Angeles Knight Riders, on the other hand, have majorly dipped since beginning their campaign with a victory.\n\nDATE & TIME: Sunday 14th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:30pm / USA PT – 12:30pm / West Indies – 2:30pm / UK – 8:30pm / South Africa – 9:30pm / Monday 15th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:30am / India – 1:00am / Bangladesh – 1:30am/ Australia – 5:30am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 35c or 95 F with clear, sunny skies\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM FORM: THE IMPRESSIVE WASHINGTON\n\nLed by Steve Smith, the Washington Freedom have a generally very impressive squad in this season’s Major League Cricket competition and that has reflected in the results with victories over last season’s finalists, MI New York and the Seattle Orcas. Even in their game that was eventually washed out, they were on 62-0 off just four overs in the hunt for 204 against the Texas Super Kings.\n\nLAST THREE: WAWLL\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: BACK TO BAD HABITS\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders finished rock-bottom in the Major League Cricket table last season but they managed to win their opening game against the aforementioned Texas Super Kings. Since then, though, they have been handily beaten by both the San Francisco Unicorns and Seattle Orcas so are under pressure as they head into this one at Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nLAST THREE: ALLWW\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nTravis Head has had an inconsistent opening set of matches and was dismissed for a two-ball duck in a low-scoring victory over the Orcas the other day. It is and will remain a rarity for the Australian to miss out too often, though, and against what is a fairly weak LAKR attack, backing Head to cash in as the Freedom’s top scorer would seem a reasonable shout.\n\nIt was an impressive display with the ball the other day in that win against Seattle as they bowled them out for just 124 in 19.4 overs. Lockie Ferguson had bowled really well until that point but failed to take wickets so the New Zealander picking up 4-26 will please him greatly. Ferguson continuing his good form with two or more wickets here seems likely.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nLAKR have really struggled to get off the mark with any sort of a flyer so far. Even their 12-run win over TSK was an unlikely defence of just 162. There is a lot of onus on David Miller to continue where he left off against Seattle Orcas whereby he scored 44 off just 22. Miller to be their top batter in the match seems the best bet for every LAKR match.\n\nBowling-wise, LAKR are fairly ineffective and lack any real thrust and incision, reliant on an ageing attack that includes the likes of Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan and Ali Khan. Their one dynamic weapon with the ball remains Spencer Johnson and he should pretty much always be backed to be their top bowler in a game.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS LOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThis one does actually appear to be a bit of a mismatch. Having a victory already in this tournament, which is better than they had at this stage of last season, is a small improvement and yet still flattering to what is an average LAKR side. This could end up being quite one sided on what should be a dry and difficult pitch but one that should suit the impressive Freedom top order. A comfortable Washington Freedom victory is to be expected.",
    "summary": "**Match Details:**\nThe Washington Freedom, led by Steve Smith, will face the Los Angeles Knight Riders in their fourth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket campaign on July 14, 2024, at Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States.\n\n**Recent Form:**\nThe Washington Freedom have won two matches so far, defeating MI New York and the Seattle Orcas, while one game against the Texas Super Kings was washed out due to weather. The Los Angeles Knight Riders, on the other hand, won their opening game but have since been defeated by the San Francisco Unicorns and Seattle Orcas.\n\n**Key Players:**\nFor Washington Freedom, Travis Head is expected to score well against the Los Angeles Knight Riders' weak attack, while Lockie Ferguson is likely to continue his good form with the ball. For Los Angeles Knight Riders, David Miller is expected to be their top batter, while Spencer Johnson is their top bowling prospect.\n\n**Prediction:**\nThe article predicts a comfortable Washington Freedom victory, citing the team's impressive squad and form, while the Los Angeles Knight Riders are expected to struggle due to their average performance so far in the tournament.",

Nevertheless, they will be keen to secure a victory in their upcoming rematch against the Texas Super Kings, this time set to be played in Dallas.\n\nThe abandonment of the match due to rain underscores the unpredictable nature of cricket and the impact of weather on the sport. Fans and players alike were left frustrated as the elements took precedence over the game. Both teams will now look forward to their next face-off, hoping for clear skies and a chance to compete.\n\nAs the Major League Cricket 2024 progresses, every point becomes crucial, and both Texas Super Kings and MI New York will be eyeing their next clash with determination to improve their standings and continue their pursuit of the championship.",

The excitement continues with the first knockout game, the Eliminator, scheduled for Thursday, July 25th. In this high-stakes match, the Texas Super Kings will face off against MI New York for a coveted spot in the Qualifier. The first ball is set to be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT), but be sure to tune in earlier for all the pre-match buildup. Until then, cheers and goodbye!\n\nFaf du Plessis, the skipper of the Texas Super Kings says it was important for a few guys to get time in the middle and they decided to change the batting order a bit to make sure they head into the crucial stage with good momentum. Further adds that they focused on getting the small things right heading into the big Eliminator in a day's time.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, the skipper of Seattle Orcas says it has been a tough and difficult season for them. Adds that with a few guys being injured, it is quite difficult to find the concrete 11. Informs that the bowling group has been fantastic, but the batting group were the ones who could not make it count. Adds that it is very tough to find the rhythm of the game in just seven matches. States that they can make some investments in a couple of players. Concludes that it is not doom and gloom for the franchise and hopes to reset and re-focus for the next season.\n\nCalvin Savage is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his outstanding all-round performance. He says it was good fun after having put in so much hard work it felt very good. Adds that he tried to keep things simple in the middle and stay positive and it paid well for him with the bat. Further says he tries to vary the pace and keep it tight using long boundaries to his advantage. Concludes that he will try to keep things the same going ahead.\n\nEarlier in the game, Ayan Desai gave the Seattle Orcas a perfect start by dismissing Devon Conway on the very first ball of the innings. Cameron Gannon then joined the fray, taking another wicket in his first over. Despite these early setbacks, Faf du Plessis kept his intentions clear and continued to score from one end for TSK, but he lost his wicket just before the end of the powerplay. The Texas Super Kings kept losing wickets in the middle around Milind Kumar who looked steady in his outing but couldn't carry on after getting himself off to a good start. TSK however managed to get back on track in the final few overs, thanks to a blistering onslaught from Calvin Savage, who remained unbeaten with 45 off just 27 balls. He received valuable support from Cameron Stevenson, helping TSK reach a competitive total of 177 runs. For the Seattle Orcas, Keemo Paul and Ayan Desai had standout performances, each claiming two wickets.\n\nOttneil Baartman stood out with impressive figures of 3 for 20 for the Texas Super Kings. Alongside him, the other bowlers chipped in to ensure the job was done. Noor Ahmad was a mystery for the Orcas batters, ending with a couple of wickets, while Calvin Savage also claimed two wickets. Despite a few missed chances in the field, the Texas Super Kings will be mighty pleased with their efforts, particularly their comeback with the bat. They will now carry this momentum into the all-important eliminator.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, on whom the game was resting, once again failed to make his presence felt, extending his dry run with another low score and putting the Orcas in an even deeper hole. The Texas Super Kings' spinners compounded the Orcas' struggles, making run-scoring increasingly difficult. Shubham Ranjane and Keemo Paul fought back with a 39-run partnership, attempting to take on a few bowlers in the middle overs. However, with the asking rate soaring, it became an insurmountable task, resulting in another defeat for the Orcas. This marked their sixth loss in seven games, ending the tournament on a forgettable note.\n\nOttneil Baartman gave the Super Kings a perfect start by claiming the wicket of Ryan Rickelton on the very first ball of the innings. Despite a gritty partnership between Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya, the bowlers kept things tight, building pressure on the batters. This pressure led to the fall of a couple more wickets before the halfway mark, further complicating the chase for the Seattle Orcas.\n\nW\n\nOvers18.5\n\nScore132 - 9\n\nOttneil Baartman to Ali Sheikh, OUT! CAUGHT! Another one bites the dust. Ottneil Baartman entices the batter with the short one and he falls for it. Ali Sheikh swivels on his back foot and pulls it to deep square leg. The ball is hit flat and hard, but straight down the throat of Marcus Stoinis who makes no mistake this time either.\n\nW\n\nOvers18.3\n\nScore131 - 8\n\nOttneil Baartman to Cameron Gannon, OUT! CAUGHT! Marcus Stoinis takes a stunning catch near the ropes. It is too full, wide outside off. Cameron Gannon throws his blade at it and ends up slicing it to the left of deep backward point. Marcus Stoinis moves to his left and pouches it safely.\n\nW\n\nOvers16.4\n\nScore110 - 7\n\nOttneil Baartman to Shubham Ranjane, OUT! RUN OUT! A huge mix-up and Shubham Ranjane is a goner. It is a slower bumper, outside off. Shubham Ranjane miscues it towards mid on and ventures out looking for a single, but is caught in two minds here. Joshua Tromp charges in and throws it to the bowler, who gathers it and takes the bails off quickly at the non-striker's end.\n\nStrategic break! With 77 runs needed off the last 5 overs, the Seattle Orcas will need a few explosive overs right after this break to put pressure back on the opposition. These two batters have the capability to turn the game around but will need to focus on taking the game deep to maximize their chance. While for Texas Super Kings, a couple more wickets will probably put them closer to the winning line.",

    "body": "oi-Avinash Sharma\n\nDallas, (TX), Jul 24: Led by Calvin Savage's stellar all-round performance, the Texas Super Kings handed the Seattle Orcas a comprehensive 37-run defeat in the final league match of the Major League Cricket 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, on Tuesday (July 23).\n\nDespite Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya giving the Orcas a solid start in their run chase, the Texas Super Kings' bowlers, led by Ottneil Bartmann (3/20), Noor Ahmad (2/19), and Calvin Savage (2/23), dismantled the Seattle batting lineup.\n\nWith the match's conclusion, Seattle Orcas finished their campaign with six losses and a sole victory, whereas the Texas Super Kings, who secured three wins and two losses (two no results), will play MI New York in the eliminator.\n\nSeattle Orcas' Run Chase Falters\n\nMirroring the first innings, the Seattle Orcas' run chase lost Ryan Rickleton (0) off the first ball of the innings to Ottneil Bartmann. Shehan Jayasuriya (24) joined Quinton de Kock (26), and the pair took control of the run chase. At the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 47/1.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya eventually fell to Calvin Savage in the seventh over after a 27-ball stint at the crease. Not long after, the dangerous Quinton de Kock was also dismissed, leaving the Orcas at 59/3 in the ninth over.\n\nFaced with a steep equation, the onus was on Heinrich Klaasen (4) and Matthew Bracewell (4) to steer the innings. However, both batters were outfoxed by spinners and dismissed for single digits. Mitchell Santner saw the back of Klaasen, while Bracewell was trapped lbw by Noor Ahmad.\n\nComing together with the score at 67/5 in 10.4 overs, Shubham Ranjane (16) and Keemo Paul (25) laboured to keep the Orcas in contention. However, Ranjane was run out and Keemo Paul was castled by Noor Ahmad before the 17th over, comprehensively extinguishing the run chase.\n\nAli Sheikh chipped in with a consolatory knock, but the Orcas fell well short, finishing at 140/9. Ottneil Bartmann took two wickets in the tail to finish with figures of 3/20.\n\nTexas Super Kings' Innings\n\nEarlier in the day, the Texas Super Kings lost opener Devon Conway (0) and Joshua Tromp (6) early in the innings. However, Faf Du Plessis (37) was in fine form, smashing six boundaries and a six before he was scalped by Keemo Paul. At the end of the power play, the Texas Super Kings were placed at 56/3.\n\nMilind Kumar (27) played a watchful knock, scoring nearly a run-a-ball before he became Keemo Paul's second wicket of the day. The experienced all-rounders, Marcus Stoinis (11) and Mitchell Santner (15), both got starts but failed to convert them into bigger scores, falling to Aryan Desai and Matthew Bracewell, respectively.\n\nCalvin Savage (45*) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson.

As a result, USA have also qualified for the T20 World Cup 2026 to be played in India.\n\nMeanwhile, after giving us some enthralling cricket action, the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 season is nearing its climax, with the four teams advancing to the knockout stage already confirmed, even though one group-stage match remains as of writing this between the Texas Super Kings and Seattle Orcas. This upcoming match will not influence the standings or the knockout phase though.\n\nFind Best Betting Tips and Predictions for Major League Cricket 2024 Here\n\nThe teams advancing to the MLC 2024 knockouts are Washington Freedom (WSF), San Francisco Unicorns (SFU), Texas Super Kings (TSK), and MI New York (MINY), as all the teams finished in top four in the MLC 2024 points table. Now many might wonder how does the Major League Cricket (MLC) playoffs format works. In this article, we take a look at the MLC 2024 Playoffs format.\n\nThe Major League Cricket format is very much similar to that of the most successful T20 league in the world, the Indian Premier League (IPL).

However, in this case, in the MLC, we will have the Eliminator first between the 3rd and 4th placed team. The winner of the match of will progress into the playoffs further while the loser is completely out of the competition, just like the Eliminator match in the IPL.\n\nQualifier in MLC 2024\n\nNow, Major League Cricket’s Qualifier is equivalent of the Indian Premier League (IPL)’s Qualifier 1. The top 2 teams at the end of the league phase in the MLC 2024 points table will play in this match. And just the like IPL, the winner of this match will directly progress into the MLC 2024 Final while the losing team will have another opportunity.\n\nChallenger in MLC 2024\n\nIn the Indian Premier League (IPL), in the Qualifier 2, the winner of the Eliminator and the loser of the Qualifier 1 plays. It is exactly the same format here as well where the Eliminator winning team will take on the losing team from the Qualifier match and in the end, the winning team will qualify for the Final against Qualifier winner. And rather than calling it qualifier, they call it Challenger as it identifies the challenger team for the Qualifier winner in the MLC 2024 Final.\n\nELIMINATOR: Texas Super Kings vs MI New York – 25th July, 6 A.M Indian Standard Time (IST), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium\n\nQUALIFIER: Washington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns – 26th July, 6 A.M Indian Standard Time (IST), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium\n\nCHALLENGER: Winner of Eliminator vs Loser of Qualifier – 27 July, 6 A.M Indian Standard Time (IST), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium",

The fast bowler looked in good rhythm and bowled impeccable lines and lengths, not allowing the batters to free their arms in the chase of 166.\n\nCarmi le Roux bowled a full delivery outside off to which batter Ryan Rickelton drove it back to the bowler. The ball hit him straight in the face as it came hard. He had no chance to save himself as the ball hit him and went onto towards mid-on. The pacer was down and in a bit of pain.\n\nWith the blow that he faced, Carmi le Roux wasn't in a position to bowl. He then walked off the field and he looked in immense pain.

They picked wickets at regular intervals and sealed the game.\n\nLiam Plunkett was the pick of the bowlers with his figures of 3/26. Along with him, Matthew Short, Corey Anderson, and Pat Cummins picked one wicket each. They restricted the opposition to a total of 142/6 and won the game by the margin of 23 runs to get important two points under their belt.\n\nFor Seattle Orcas, Shehan Jayasuriya was the only batter who looked settled at the crease.

    "body": "Cricket\n\n-OneArabia\n\nWashington Freedom secured a dominant 94-run victory over MI New York in their fifth match of Major League Cricket 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas. Travis Head and Andries Gous led the charge with impressive half-centuries, propelling Washington to a formidable total of 182/5 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, Washington's openers, Steve Smith and Travis Head, provided a steady start. However, Smith was dismissed by Rashid Khan in the fifth over after scoring 8 off 10 balls. Head then took control and formed a crucial partnership with Andries Gous. Their combined efforts helped Washington cross the 100-run mark by the 11th over.\n\nHead's aggressive innings of 54 off 33 balls included nine fours and two sixes before he was caught at long-on by Rashid Khan off Romario Shepherd’s bowling in the next over. Glen Maxwell followed soon after, despite being dropped earlier by Steven Taylor. Rashid Khan eventually dismissed Maxwell in the 16th over for 15 off 14 balls.\n\nIn the final overs, Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra accelerated the scoring rate. Gous reached his half-century in the 19th over, while Ravindra hammered two sixes and a four off Trent Boult in the same over, adding 23 runs. Ravindra was dismissed by Kieron Pollard for a quickfire 31 off 14 balls on the third ball of the final over. Gous ended his vital knock of 59 off 48 balls by getting caught on the last ball of the innings.\n\nWashington Freedom's bowlers then delivered an exceptional performance to dismantle MI New York for just 88 runs. The win ensured Washington Freedom became the first team to qualify for the Playoffs this season, solidifying their lead at the top of the points table with nine points from five matches.\n\nMI New York's Struggles\n\nMI New York had a disastrous start to their chase as they lost five wickets within the Powerplay, scoring only 25 runs. Steven Taylor (0 off 3), Monank Patel (4 off 6), Dewald Brevis (2 off 5), Shayan Jahangir (3 off 9), and Nicholas Pooran (4 off 6) were all dismissed cheaply by Washington’s bowlers.\n\nThe situation worsened as skipper Kieron Pollard (4 off 9) and Rashid Khan (7 off 6) were also sent back to the pavilion by the ninth over with MI New York struggling at 56/7. Romario Shepherd and Trent Boult showed some resistance by adding a quickfire partnership of 33 runs from just 16 balls.\n\nMaxwell Seals Victory\n\nShepherd’s valiant effort ended in the 11th over when he was dismissed for a brisk 25 off just 14 balls. Maxwell wrapped up proceedings for Washington Freedom by taking two wickets in the same over. He removed Boult (16 off 13) on his first delivery and Ehsan Adil (0 off 2) on his third ball, bowling out MI New York for just 88 runs.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Andries Gous:59 off48; Travis Head:54off33; Kieron Pollard:2/14in2overs) beat MI New York(Romario Shepherd:25off14; Trent Boult:16off13; Jasdeep Singh:3/14in3overs)by94runs.\n\nThis comprehensive win highlights Washington Freedom's strong form this season as they continue their quest for glory in Major League Cricket.\n\nStory first published: Wednesday, July 17, 2024, 14:33 [GST]",

He has picked up 12 wickets for us so far this season at an astonishing average of 9.16 runs per wicket and a strike rate of 7.66.\n\nNetravalkar, who had a successful T20 World Cup 2024 campaign for the United States, has brought his rich vein of form into the MLC. The left-arm pacer was the USA’s top wicket-taker in the showpiece event with six wickets from six matches.\n\nNetravalkar averaged 20.83 and took a wicket every three overs he bowled (strike rate of 18.83) in the T20 World Cup. In a group where the USA were not even favorites to proceed to the Super 8, he, along with our wicketkeeper-batter Andries Gous, who finished as the USA’s top run-getter, took the team to the next round in a fairytale start to the country’s journey at ICC events.\n\nThe Mumbai-born Netravalkar earned accolades for his performance against Pakistan, where he bowled a high-pressure super over to win a thriller, and against India, getting the prized wickets of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.\n\nConsistent Performances\n\nNetravalkar had a tally of 10 wickets from six matches in MLC 2023, averaging 1.67 wickets per match. He picked up a wicket every 15.90 runs he conceded and for every 13.10 deliveries he bowled in the last edition.\n\nOur pacer finished as the joint fourth-highest wicket-taker overall in MLC 2023, with his 6/9 against the San Francisco Unicorns being the best figures recorded by any bowler in the MLC to date.\n\nComing into a new season, Netravalkar has become more lethal and consistent for us. His average wickets per match has moved up to three from 1.67 last year. The runs conceded per wicket has come down from 15.90 to 9.16 and balls per wicket has also reduced sharply from 13.10 to 7.66 compared to last year.\n\nNetravalkar’s economy has also marginally improved from 7.28 runs an over in 2023 to 7.17 currently. His clever variations and change of pace have made it difficult for batters to score against him with the dot-ball percentage going up from 42.75% last year to 52.17% this year.\n\nNetravalkar has had an excellent season so far in the MLC this year and his performance in the upcoming matches will be vital for us to go the distance.",

    "body": "Seattle Orcas will take on the LA Knight Riders in the 15th match of Major League Cricket 2024.\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Match 1 Preview\n\nThis match will be crucial for both of these teams’ hopes for a playoff qualification.\n\nSeattle Orcas have been dismal this season so far. Out of the four matches they have played, they have won only one. This puts them dead last in the points table with two points. On a two-match losing streak, this team needs to get a few positive results to turn around their season and they need to start winning some games now.\n\nAs for the LA Knight Riders, it could be argued that their season so far has been worse than that of the Orcas. Out of their five games so far, LA has won only one, lost three and one was washed out. They are only fourth on the table with three points because of their washed-out game against the San Francisco Unions. Out of the two reaming games, the Knight Riders have to win at least one for a place in the playoffs and a win here would give this side a solid boost.\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Match 1 MLC 2024: Match Details\n\nMatch: Seattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders, Major League Cricket match 14\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina\n\nDate & Time: Thursday, July 18, 12:30 AM (IST)/ July 17, 3:00 PM (local time)\n\nLive Broadcast and Streaming: Sony Sports Network, JioCinema App & Website\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Announced Squads\n\nSeattle Orcas Announced Squad\n\nWayne Parnell (C), Quinton de Kock (wk), Aaron Jones, Hammad Azam, Nauman Anwar, Heinrich Klaasen, Ryan Rickelton, Michael Bracewell, Shehan Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Waseem, Harmeet Singh, Nathan Ellis, Ali Sheikh, Obed McCoy, Nandre Burger, Lance Morris, Cameron Gannon, Ayan Desai, Zaman Khan\n\nLA Knight Riders Announced Squad\n\nSunil Narine (C), Jason Roy, Nitish Kumar, Unmukt Chand (wk), David Miller, Saif Badar, Alex Carey (wk), Adithya Ganesh (wk), Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Shadley van Chalkwyk, Corne Dry, Adam Zampa, Ali Khan, Josh Little, Spencer Johnson, Matthew Tromp, Derone Davis, Waqar Salamkheil\n\nCheck Out: Seattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Prediction MLC\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Pitch Report\n\nThis is one of the few pitches in modern T20 cricket (but maybe a typical pitch in the US) that is more bowling-friendly. This is a dry surface where the ball spins in the first innings. The pitch breaks down even more in the second, making it even more difficult to bat on.\n\nThe average score in the first inning here is somewhere around the 140-run mark, which falls drastically in the second inning, making batting first the common choice here after winning the toss.\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Weather Report\n\nThere is a heat advisory out in North Carolina, with the temperatures in the high 30s. The high humidity will make it feel like over 40 degrees Celcius.\n\nThe skies will be clear and cloudy periodically, with heavy thunderstorms and rains also expected. However, the match is not likely to be washed away. The winds will also be strong.\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Predicted Playing XI\n\nSeattle Orcas Predicted Playing XI\n\nRyan Rickelton, Shehan Jayasuriya, Quinton de Kock (wk), Heinrich Klaasen (C), Aaron Jones, Harmeet Singh, Hammad Azam, Cameron Gannon, Imad Wasim, Nandre Curger, Zaman Khan\n\nLA Knight Riders Predicted Playing XI\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine (C), Unmukt Chand, Shakib Al Hasan, Saif Badar, Nitish Kumar, David Miller, Andre Russell, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Head To Head Record\n\nMatches Played: 02\n\nSeattle Orcas Won: 01\n\nLA Knight Riders Won: 01\n\nNo Result: 00\n\nFirst Played: July 23, 2023\n\nLast Played: July 10, 2024\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Prediction MLC\n\nWhile this match will be highly affected by the toss, we can not keep that in mind while making a prediction. So instead, we will look back at the recent record of these two teams, which has been fairly similar in this tournament. It is clear that both these sides do not compete with the better team this season, seeing how they have lost most of their matches by a big margin.\n\nIn their game earlier this season, the Seattle Orcas won their one and only match, this team also seems to have a better bowling attack as a whole. But, the Knight Riders have a better spin attack, giving them a distinct advantage on this dry track.\n\nThe LA Knight Riders also seem to have a better batting order, making them the favorites to win this one.\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Prediction MLC: LA Knight Riders will defeat Seattle Orcas in the 1st Match of Major League Cricket 2024",

    "body": "Dallas-Fort Worth continues to expand its sports landscape and the state of Texas took a front row seat with the launch of Cognizant Major League Cricket in the United States in 2023.\n\nTexas Super Kings, the Major League Cricket franchise based in Texas, is headlined by veteran South African and Top Order Batter Faf du Plessis, who returns for his second season. He will be joined by wicket-keeper Devon Conway, Australian power-hitter Marcus Stoinis, fast-bowler Naveen Ul Haq, and Team USA’s Milind Kumar.\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) is the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States, which began in 2023. Exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, MLC showcases superstar players from around the globe, bringing world-class T20 cricket to America.\n\nAs the 2024 season is underway, here’s some quick facts on MLC and what you can expect from T20 Cricket:\n\nWhere are the matches played?\n\nMatches will take place at Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina. The full schedule and available tickets can be viewed here.\n\nWho are the teams?\n\nThere’s six teams currently in the MLC, representing different cities and regions within the United States - The Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom.\n\nWho won last year?\n\nMI New York claimed victory in the inaugural 2023 MLC season, defeating the Seattle Orcas.\n\nWhat is T20 Cricket?\n\nT20, or Twenty20 is one format of cricket.\n\nIt is a shortened format (around 3 hours) where each team has 20 overs (this includes 120 balls) to score the most runs.\n\nIt’s known for its explosive batting as the time constraints means more incentive to hit big “sixes” and take risks. (Sixes are similar to homeruns for all the baseball fans out there).\n\nAn 'over' is the name given to six consecutive balls bowled by one ‘bowler’. There are 20 of these overs in an ‘inning’.There are two innings in a game.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nEach team has 11 batsmen that will attempt to score more runs (points) than their opponent.\n\nThe fielding side will be trying to get all the batsmen out as soon as possible to keep the runs total low.\n\nA team earns one run when a batsman hits the ball and runs from one set of stumps to the other.\n\nTeams earn four runs for hitting the ball out of bounds and six runs for hitting the ball out of bounds without it hitting the ground.\n\nThe bowler is the player who throws the ball at the stumps to try to knock the ‘bails’ off. (The bowlers are the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball).\n\nWickets/stumps are the three vertical sticks with two smaller ones called bails laid horizontally on top. The goal is to knock the bails off.\n\nA player on the fielding team stands behind the stumps to catch the ball.\n\nThe white lines on the ground is the crease, this is where the wickets and batsman should be.\n\nWhat has MLC done for Cricket in the USA?\n\nMLC has revolutionized the cricket landscape in the USA. Cognizant Major League Cricket was recently awarded List-A status, recognized by the ICC as an official T20 league, making it America’s first world-class domestic tournament. The inaugural 2023 season was a huge success, with sold-out matches garnering millions of viewers worldwide. The recent T20 World Cup was played across the USA and West Indies and saw team USA both co-host and participate in the tournament for the first time. Forty-seven of the players who took part in the World Cup will remain in the USA for MLC.\n\nMLC FAMILY DAYS - SUNDAY SPECIAL\n\nMake your next family outing one to remember.

    "body": "Right then, that is it from the qualifier game of the Major League Cricket between San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom. It is Washingtom Freedom that have sealed their spot in the finals while the San Francisco will have another chance to make it there. The Challenger game will be played on the 27th of July 2024 at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT) where the Unicorns will face the Texas Super Kings. Our coverage will start an hour earlier so make sure to tune in for an exciting mactch. Until then, goodbye and cheers!\n\nSteven Smith, the captain of Washington Freedom says that captaincy has been fun and the team works as a unit. Says that it has been a good campaign and appreciates his team for playing well. Mentions that he wanted wickets with the new ball to make it easier towards the later stages. Credits Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell for playing well. Adds that Head is confident and tries to hit every ball and targets all the pockets of the ground which works for him.\n\nCorey Anderson, the captain of San Francisco Unicorns says that losing 4 wickets in the first innings was tough and that they were 20-30 runs short. Feels that they weren’t up to the mark throughout the game. Says that the batters need to take risks and they will bounce back stronger.\n\nTravis Head is the Player of the Match for his scintillating knock. He says that batting in the Powerplay is fun for him. Adds that he tries to get that fast start and that is his role in the team. Mentions that the wicket here is good and the swing on offer here allows him to play some good shots. Says that the team has full faith in him and has given him free air to do his thing.\n\nRachin Ravindra is up for a chat. He says that he is happy with his bowling and it was a good day for them. Mentions that it is all about execution and is happy to fulfill the role of the backup bowler. Adds that he aims to be a genuine all rounder and help the teams that he is a part of. Says that he tries to soak it as much as he can and learn from the senior players and coaches. Feels that he is adjusting to the role and learns from every experience.\n\nEarlier in the match, Washington Freedom won the toss and opted to have San Francisco bat first. The innings began with Marco Jansen claiming an early wicket, dismissing Finn Allen cheaply. Jake Fraser-McGurk followed suit, falling to Saurabh Netravalkar without scoring. Wickets kept on tumbling for them until Hassan Khan and Anderson joined hands. Hassan Khan played a commendable innings, scoring 57 runs, supported by Corey Anderson's 26 off 19, as they added 61 runs for the 6th wicket from just 35 balls. Once Anderson departed, the things kept falling apart for them. Rachin Ravindra was the standout bowler for the Washington Freedom with remarkable figures of 4 wickets for just 11 runs. Marco Jansen took three wickets but was expensive, while Saurabh Netravalkar ended up with 2 wickets in his kitty.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns would have wanted a few more runs on the board in the first innings but Pat Cummins gave them a great start with the wicket of Steven Smith. Hassan Khan then worked his spin magic and sent Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra back in consecutive overs. After that, the bowlers just gave away some loose deliveries and got themselves under pressure. The poor overs by Haris Rauf and Corey Anderson didn't help their cause and they failed to break the partnership. In the end, the total was a bit low to defend. However, they will still have one more chance in the Challenger to give themselves a ticket to the finals.\n\nWashington Freedom have beaten San Francisco Unicorns very confidently and established themselves in the finals directly! They had a shaky start with the early dismissal of Steven Smith and the initial struggle by Travis Head. However, Andries Gous came in to play a few shots while Travis Head too found his rhythm. His onslaught combined with Glenn Maxwell's power hitting gave the boost needed to this team. The positive intent got the opposition under pressure and sealed the game in their favor.\n\n6\n\nOvers14.4\n\nScore134 - 3\n\nHassan Khan to Glenn Maxwell, SIX! DISPATCHED! Too full and outside off. Glenn Maxwell fetches it from outside off and sends it flying over the long on fence for the second one of the over.\n\n1\n\nOvers13.4\n\nScore118 - 3\n\nCorey Anderson to Travis Head, BRILLIANT EFFORT! On a length and outside off. Travis Head reaches for it and carves it aerially towards deep point. Sherfane Rutherford runs in and collects it. The umpires want to have a check upstairs. The replays show that the ball has touched the ground and hence it has been given NOT OUT! The batters run a single.\n\n4\n\nOvers13.2\n\nScore113 - 3\n\nCorey Anderson to Travis Head, FOUR! EDGED AGAIN! On the hard length and outside off. Travis Head throws his bat at it and the ball flies over short third this time. The ball again, meets the ropes for four more.\n\n4\n\nOvers12.6\n\nScore105 - 3\n\nPat Cummins to Glenn Maxwell, FOUR! LOVELY! Slow and on a length outside off. Glenn Maxwell just opens up his blade and guides it past backward point. The ball races off to the fence for four runs to end the over.\n\n4\n\nOvers11.1\n\nScore86 - 3\n\nJuanoy Drysdale to Travis Head, FOUR! THE ATTACK IS ON! Full and outside off. Travis Head gets low and carves it past point. The ball races off to the fence for four runs to begin the over.\n\n6\n\nOvers10.6\n\nScore82 - 3\n\nHassan Khan to Glenn Maxwell, SIX! BANG BANG! Quicker now and on off. Glenn Maxwell slogs it with much power and timing to launch the ball into the stands behind long on for consecutive sixes. A good over by Hassan Khan was turned around in just a couple of deliveries.\n\n0\n\nOvers9.6\n\nScore69 - 3\n\nHaris Rauf to Glenn Maxwell, Short but angled into the batter. Glenn Maxwell slices it towards the fielder at point. A quiet couple of over for Washington Freedom, they might be hoping for some boundaries to come soon.\n\n1lb\n\nOvers9.4\n\nScore68 - 3\n\nHaris Rauf to Glenn Maxwell, Leg bye! Quick and on a length around leg. Glenn Maxwell is hit on the pads and the ball rockets towards Josh Inglis. Inglis tries to stop it but the ball hits the tip of his hand and rolls towards deep third. The batters cross for a leg bye and Inglis seems to be in some pain.\n\n1\n\nOvers9.1\n\nScore65 - 3\n\nHaris Rauf to Travis Head, FIFTY FOR TRAVIS HEAD! Full and on leg. Travis Head drives it to long on for a single. That is the fifth consecutive fifty for Travis Head.",

    "body": "The stunning match of the American-based Major League Cricket (MLC) season was between the Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas. While there was not much at stake in terms of qualification to the playoffs until the last games, it was still important for the Super Kings to score a victory in the game. This was a major decision that saw the Seattle Orcas take the field before the Texas Super Kings, though this did not take long. The Super Kings faced a lot of trouble on the field, which resulted in the collapse of the team at one point, and by the end of the second over, they were down 12/2.\n\nWhile Faf du Plessis painstakingly tried to ensure a more sedate approach, wickets tumbled in a heap, and the Super Kings were in a state of disarray.\n\nMitchell Santner’s Heroic Moment For Texas Super Kings\n\nWhile the Texas Super Kings struggled against the rising pressure of Seattle Orca’s bowling attack, Kiwi all-rounder Mitchell Santner rose to the occasion. The fifth delivery of the 11th over saw Santner come up with a shot, which must have been a huge relief for his team, who seemed to be teetering at that stage. This particular shot reminded me a lot of one of the legends of the Super Kings, Suresh Raina.\n\nAli Sheikh, the Orcas’ spinner, bowled the ball up on off-stump, and there was no nonsense about Santner, who started showing immense composure and accuracy and played a wonderful inside-out against the spinner over long-off for a giant six. It could also be seen as a soft skill for the analysis, and the timing for this shot was reminiscent of Raina’s famous move. Raina was famous for playing spinner, and this shot was famous with him when he played for Super Kings, while Santner did this well as a mimic to Raina.\n\nA Tribute to Suresh Raina\n\nIt was not just a show of force, but it was all about Suresh Raina and his great contribution to the Indian cricket team. Raina, one of the superior strapping batsmen loved for his originality and hostility against spinners, was a part of the Super Kings’ legacy. Santner, in particular, mimicked Raina’s shot in the context of the match’s execution, where he went inside out to a spinner, thus giving the fans a memory to denote.\n\nOver the courtesy of some fine fast bowling from the Orcas, Santner’s knock was the only bright spark for the Super Kings as the match went on. His capacity to embody the spirit of one of the squad greats established his worth within the lineup, becoming a symbol of strength at the touchdown poker site amid the team’s misfortunes.\n\nWhile the result of the match was not decisive and seemingly did not change the position of the teams significantly, the moment when Mitchell Santner set for the ball and scored a long shot supported by Ali Sheikh was the moment that made cricket exciting and presented the essence of the Texas Super Kings. In such a lighter vein, as the Super Kings will turn their attention to the playoffs, Santner’s innings underlined the best virtues of this team.",

Du Plessis scored 45 runs off 22 deliveries, including seven boundaries and one six. However, the TSK skipper's innings ended with a spectacular one-handed catch by Corey Anderson during the fifth over.\n\nThe right-handed batter mistimed a shot off pacer Carmi le Roux.

Anderson said that his catch of Faf du Plessis was pivotal in disrupting the Super Kings' momentum.\n\n\"I thought they kept going (TSK batters), but we kept hanging in and we had runs on the board. He was incredible tonight, won us the moments in the middle (on Drysdale), was a bit underdone coming into the tournament, but has got better with games. It was moments like that which will help us going further (on his one-handed catch), Faf has been playing well right through the tournament, so that catch helped us to stall some of the momentum away from them,\" Anderson said.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns will face the Washington Freedom in the final game at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday, July 29 (IST).",

    "body": "In a match that will be etched into Major League Cricket (MLC) folklore, Glenn Maxwell‘s colossal six propelled the Washington Freedom to a thrilling seven-wicket victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in Qualifier of the MLC 2024. Chasing a modest 146, Freedom were in trouble at 64/3 before Maxwell unleashed his power-hitting prowess to turn the game on its head.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have a stick\n\nBatting first, the San Francisco Unicorns posted a competitive total of 145 runs in their allotted 19 overs. Hassan Khan, the tournament’s standout bowler, once again showcased his talent with a quickfire 57. However, the Unicorns’ innings was derailed by a brilliant spell from Rachin Ravindra, who claimed four wickets for just 11 runs to stifle the Unicorns’ momentum. Marco Jansen also chipped in with three wickets as the Freedom bowlers kept a tight leash on the Unicorns’ batting.\n\nGlenn Maxwell’s masterclass\n\nWith the bat, Washington Freedom were off to a shaky start, losing their top three batters cheaply. The pressure was mounting on the Freedom, but then, Maxwell arrived at the crease. The Australian maverick wasted no time in asserting his dominance, launching into the Unicorns’ bowlers with reckless abandon.\n\nThe highlight of the innings, and perhaps the entire tournament so far, came when Maxwell deposited a Hassan delivery into orbit during the 15th over. The ball cleared the boundary with disdain, going a staggering 103 meters away. The crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium was left in awe as they witnessed a shot that will be replayed for years to come.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nMaxwell’s brutal hitting took the game away from the Unicorns. He raced to a fifty, providing the much-needed impetus to the Freedom chase. With Travis Head providing steady support, the duo ensured that Washington Freedom crossed the line with seven wickets in hand and three balls to spare.\n\nAlso WATCH: Pat Cummins dismisses Steve Smith on the very first ball of his spell in MLC 2024\n\nWashington Freedom advance to the Final\n\nThe victory propels Washington Freedom into the final of the MLC 2024. They will be brimming with confidence after Maxwell’s match-winning heroics. On the other hand, the San Francisco Unicorns will be disappointed to miss out on the final, but they can take solace from their impressive performance throughout the tournament.\n\nHassan, despite conceding the longest six of the tournament, has been a revelation and will undoubtedly be a key player for the Unicorns in the future. The final promises to be a blockbuster clash and cricket fans around the world will be eagerly anticipating the showdown between the two best teams in the tournament.",
    "summary": "**Match Result:** Washington Freedom won by 7 wickets against San Francisco Unicorns in the Qualifier of MLC 2024.\n\n**Score:** San Francisco Unicorns scored 145 runs in 19 overs, while Washington Freedom chased it down with 7 wickets in hand and 3 balls to spare.\n\n**Key Performances:**\n\n* Glenn Maxwell delivered a match-winning performance, scoring a fifty and hitting a 103-meter six, the longest of the tournament, to turn the game in favor of Washington Freedom.\n* Rachin Ravindra took 4 wickets for 11 runs to restrict San Francisco Unicorns' innings.\n* Hassan Khan scored 57 runs for San Francisco Unicorns, but conceded the longest six of the tournament to Maxwell.\n\n**Tournament Implications:** Washington Freedom advances to the final of MLC 2024, while San Francisco Unicorns are eliminated from the tournament.",

    "body": "Despite being 40, Faf du Plessis is the best batter in the Major League Cricket 2024. He was also brilliant in IPL 2024. There is no reason why he cannot play a few more years in the IPL. However, Royal Challengers Bengaluru may not retain him. He may not be worth the retention amount, especially because of his game. That said, a few other teams will target to sign him. On that note, here, we take a look at the list of two franchises which might target Faf du Plessis for IPL 2025 if he is released by RCB.\n\n1) Chennai Super Kings\n\nIt is for the Texas Super Kings that Faf du Plessis played so well in MLC 2024. He was decent for the Joburg Super Kings in SA20 2024. Considering his past success at CSK, it is not a surprise if CSK goes back for him again in the IPL 2025 Mega Auctions.\n\nAt the moment, CSK needs an opener who can make the best use of the powerplay. Both Faf and Devon Conway combined well for TSK in MLC 2024. CSK will look to have both of them back again in the side. Faf is a CSK legend and it is best that he gets his farewell at this franchise as per the fans of CSK. It needs to be seen if this could happen, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Punjab Kings\n\nPunjab Kings is one of the franchises which might target Faf du Plessis for IPL 2025 if he is released by RCB. It needs to be noted that Faf du Plessis is the skipper of St Lucia Kings in the CPL, a franchise which is also owned by the owners of Punjab Kings.\n\nPlus, Faf is in great form and would provide a captaincy choice straightaway. The home venue for PBKS might also suit Faf’s style although it might not be perfect for him. Under him, the franchise can adopt a better structure and streamline their progress.",
    "summary": "* Faf du Plessis, 40, is currently the best batter in the MLC 2024.\n* He played well for the Texas Super Kings in MLC 2024 and was decent for the Joburg Super Kings in SA20 2024.\n* Du Plessis' success in MLC 2024 could lead to interest from other franchises, including Chennai Super Kings and Punjab Kings, if he is released by Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n* Chennai Super Kings might be interested in re-signing du Plessis due to his past success with the franchise and his ability to pair well with Devon Conway, his opening partner for the Texas Super Kings.\n* Punjab Kings might also target du Plessis due to his captaincy experience with St Lucia Kings in the CPL, which shares the same owners as Punjab Kings.",

Lahiru Milantha (33* off 30) and Obus Pineaar (31* off 30) then made a crucial partnership of 63 runs to guide Washington Freedom across their 125 run target with 10 balls to spare.\n\nWith this victory, Washington Freedom moved to the top of the table with 5 points from three matches, standing as the only unbeaten team in the tournament thus far.\n\nSeattle Orcas came out blazing to defend a low total of 125 runs. Imad Wasim dismissed Travis Head for a duck on the second ball of the innings, ending his over with a wicket and a maiden. Steve Smith and Rachin Ravindra then tried to rebuild the score with a counter attack, and they scored as many as 18 runs in the 3rd over. Ravindra was looking dangerous with his bat, but Nandre Burger dismissed him in the fifth over for 26 off 16 balls. Smith followed him back to pavilion in the over that followed with 12 off 13, leaving the Orcas at 47/3 after 6 overs.\n\nBoth Mukhtar Ahmed and Glenn Maxwell were given lifelines as both of their catches were dropped once, but they couldn’t make use of their second chances. Ahmed(8 off 8) was dismissed by Burger in 8th over, and Maxwell(10 off 11) fell to Harmeet, leaving their team struggling at 68/5 after 10 overs.\n\nDespite the situation, Washington Freedom batters showed their agility as they carefully approached their target.\n\nEarlier in the contest, Seattle Orcas had a slow start to their innings. The Seattle batters struggled to accelerate on the slow batting track, only getting 35 runs in the powerplay.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen and Shubham Ranjane carefully made a crucial partnership that somewhat steadied Seattle’s innings. They crossed 100-run mark in the 15th over.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington bowlers didn’t allow the batters to score big.

Lahiru Milantha (33* off 30) and Obus Pienaar (31* off 30) then anchored a crucial unbeaten 63-run partnership to guide Washington Freedom past their 125-run target with 10 balls to spare.\n\nWith this win, Washington Freedom moved to the top of the points table with five points from three matches, remaining the only unbeaten team in the tournament thus far.\n\nSeattle Orcas Innings:\n\nSeattle Orcas struggled from the start, with Nauman Anwar falling cheaply for 3 off 9 balls to Saurabh Netravalkar in the second over. The batters found it difficult to accelerate on a slow batting track, managing only 35 runs in the Powerplay. Ryan Rickelton was dismissed for 4 off 11 balls by Lockie Ferguson in the sixth over.\n\nQuinton de Kock (24 off 19) started well but was bowled by Ferguson in the eighth over, leaving Seattle at 44/3. Heinrich Klaasen (51 off 29) tried to stabilize the innings with a half-century but was caught by Mukhtar Ahmed at long-off off Marco Jansen in the 15th over. Despite Klaasen's efforts, the rest of the batting lineup faltered, with Ferguson and Netravalkar dismantling the lower order.\n\nSeattle Orcas were eventually bowled out for 124 in 19.4 overs, with Cameron Gannon's brief attempt to add runs falling short as he was dismissed for 8 off 5 balls.\n\nWashington Freedom Innings\n\nChasing a modest total, Washington Freedom faced early setbacks. Imad Wasim removed Travis Head for a duck on the second ball, finishing the over with a wicket maiden. Steve Smith and Rachin Ravindra tried to rebuild with an aggressive approach, but Ravindra was dismissed by Nandre Burger for 26 off 16 balls in the fifth over, and Smith followed shortly after for 12 off 13 balls.\n\nMukhtar Ahmed and Glenn Maxwell were both given lifelines with dropped catches but couldn't capitalize. Ahmed fell for 8 off 8 balls, and Maxwell was dismissed for 10 off 11 balls, leaving Washington at 68/5 after 10 overs.\n\nHowever, Milantha and Pienaar displayed resilience, carefully steering the innings towards the target. They brought Washington Freedom to the 100-run mark in the 16th over, eventually surpassing the target with an unbeaten 63-run partnership, ensuring a win with 10 balls remaining.\n\nMLC 2024 Points Table Status after Washington Freedom win\n\nWith this victory, Washington Freedom climbed to the top of the points table, maintaining their unbeaten streak with five points from three matches.\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nSeattle Orcas: 124 all out in 19.4 overs (Heinrich Klaasen 51, Quinton de Kock 24; Lockie Ferguson 4/26)\n\nWashington Freedom: 125/5 in 18.2 overs (Lahiru Milantha 33*, Obus Pienaar 31*; Nandre Burger 2/27).",

    "body": "LAS vs SF, MLC 2024: Dream11 Predictions for Match 10 [X]\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAS) will be playing against the San Francisco Unicorns (SF) in the 10th match of the Major League Cricket (MLC 2024). This match will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, United States, on July 14th at 12:30 AM IST.\n\nAhead of the game, here is a look at the Dream11 predictions, the pitch report, fantasy tips, the top player picks and the best-predicted XIs for the fantasy contests of the match.\n\nLAS vs SF Head-to-Head Stats\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders and the San Francisco Unicorns have played two matches against each other so far. Both the games have been won by the Unicorns.\n\nLAS vs SF Pitch Report\n\nThe wicket at Chruch Street Park has looked good for batting. The batters have enjoyed the surface and have got full value for their shots. As for the bowlers, the pacers have had to rely on their cutters and variations in pace to be effective on this track. The spinners have also got some help from this wicket.\n\nHowever, with the incessant rain that has been happening here for the past 24 hours or so, there might be a might of moisture on the wicket and in the air, helping the new ball bowlers at the start of the innings.\n\nChurch Street Park Ground Stats (MLC 2024)\n\nMatches: 5\n\nMatches won batting first: 0\n\nMatches won batting second: 3\n\nNo Result or Abandoned: 2\n\nFantasy value from the pitch report\n\nThe pitch has been the best for batting in the first few overs when the ball is hard and coming on nicely to the bat. So, the top-order batters from both teams will be good picks for the game. Notably, the wicket has been easier to bat on in the second innings. So, keeping more batters from the team that is chasing could be a beneficial choice.\n\nThe spinners will be the best pick for this match. However, you can also back the faster bowlers who try to bowl into the wicket and mainly rely on the change of pace to deceive the batters.\n\nLAS vs SF Fantasy Cricket Tips\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nJason Roy, Unmukt Chand, and David Miller have been the inform batters for the Knight Riders. You can keep all three or at least two of these batters in your team if you are backing Los Angeles to win this game.\n\nSpencer Johnson has been in a great rhythm with the ball in this tournament so far. He is currently the wicket-taker for his team and will be a must-pick for the game. Andre Russell and Sunil Narine have not yet proved themselves with the ball in this tournament. However, the wicket at Church Streek Park might suit them, and the West Indian duo can give you high points.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nMatthew Short has been the man in for with the bat for the Unicorns. He has looked in supreme touch and will be one of the safest picks for the game. Finn Allen has also been in decent form and played a brilliant knock in the first game. Allen could also be a highly rewarding choice for the game.\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk has not yet found his rhythm with the bat in this tournament. However, the potential of this young Aussie batter is known to all, and he could be a decisive choice in the fantasy contests.\n\nBrody Couch has looked good with the ball and will be one of the safer picks from the Unicorns' bowling. You can also keep Haris Rauf in your team, as his ability to hit the deck could prove to be beneficial on this track. However, the game changer in this game could be the young Paksitanin spinner, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nLAS vs SF Winner Prediction\n\nThe wicket will favour the batters, and we can expect to see a match where both the teams will go past the 160 mark. In the games that have already taken place here in this edition of the MLC, we have seen that batting has got relatively easier in the second innings, and hence, the team chasing the target will have the advantage in the game.\n\nLAS vs SF Top Player Picks\n\nUnmukt Chand (LAS)\n\nThe Indian-origin US batter has looked in a decent touch with the bat. Although Unmukt Chand has not fired after the first game of the tournament, the form that he seems to be in makes him one of the safer choices from the Los Angeles batting line-up.\n\nSpencer Johnson has been the best bowler for the Los Angeles in MLC 2024 [X]\n\nSpencer Johnson (LAS)\n\nThe young Aussie speedster from this team looked the most impressive with the ball. Spencer Johnson has the most number of wickets in the tournament for his team and will be one of the better picks for the fantasy contests.\n\nMatt Short (SF)\n\nThe Australian top order batter has been in prime touch and has looked ominous in both the games. Matt Short has the form and rhythm with him and will be looking to build on that on a track that will encourage his audacious stroke play.\n\nAbrar Ahmed (SF)\n\nThough this Pakistan leggie has not picked up wicket, he has looked impressive with the areas the he has bowled.

    "body": "MI New York: In a rain-marred third match of the ongoing Major League Cricket 2024 at the Church Street Park in Morrisville, Washington Freedom prevailed over MI New York by four runs via the DLS Method.\n\nThe match was a tightly contested one. In the second innings, Washington Freedom faced an early setback with the dismissal of Travis Head (1). Steve Smith initially took a couple of overs to settle in, but once he found his rhythm and struck his first boundary on his seventh ball, the New York bowlers struggled to contain him. The Australian star batter smashed four fours and three sixes, racing to an impressive 46* off 28 balls.\n\nWith 7.4 overs of the Washington Freedom innings done, the match took a turn for the worse as rain and lighting brought on the covers. However, Smith’s power-hitting in the final over of the powerplay took them ahead on DLS with a score of 55/1. In the end, that proved enough to seal the match as rain played spoilsport.",

    "title": "After World Cup Buzz, Major League Cricket Finds Footing in U.S.",
    "date": "Mon Jul 22 01:00:00 2024",
    "body": "After many U.S. sports fans got their first taste of elite cricket during this summer’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup hosted partially in Florida, New York, and Texas, the country’s burgeoning professional competition is making noticeable strides in its second season.\n\nMajor League Cricket will finish its 21-match schedule this week before a four-team playoff crowns a new champion. While the league has six teams from coast to coast, all matches have been played at two cricket-specific venues in Texas and North Carolina. Still, attendance is tracking to potentially surpass the 70,000 fans who showed up for the inaugural season in 2023.\n\nMLC’s media rights are held by a niche cricket-focused channel called Willow by Cricbuzz. But the broadcaster struck deals with mainstream regional sports networks in each team’s market in an effort to attract more fans.\n\nDallas: Bally Sports Southwest\n\nLos Angeles: Bally Sports SoCal\n\nWashington, D.C.: Monumental Sports Network\n\nSan Francisco: NBC Sports Bay Area\n\nSeattle: Root Sports\n\nNew York: YES Network\n\nWillow took a similar approach during the T20 World Cup to get more exposure.\n\nMoney Game\n\nTeams in MLC operate under a $1.15 million salary cap. While that’s well under the roughly $12 million that franchises can spend annually in the world’s richest cricket competition, the Indian Premier League, it’s not far off from other global leagues like Cricket Australia ($2 million) and The Hundred ($1.3 million) in the U.K.\n\n“The money is good. But also the product’s good,” says Liam Plunkett (above, far right), a bowler for the San Francisco Unicorns who was a member of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup. “I think if the product wasn’t rolled out and the standard wasn’t good, people wouldn’t be that interested in coming across.”\n\nPlunkett has remained impressed with the quality of play two seasons in. “I think there were a lot of teething problems leading up to it, but when the competition started, it felt like you could be playing anywhere in the world,” he says.\n\nBig Ambitions\n\nBefore this season, San Francisco made a splash when it signed Australia national team captain Pat Cummins to a four-year contract. Have those moves been difficult to make? “Surprisingly not,” Anand Rajaraman, a co-owner of the Unicorns, tells Front Office Sports. “I think everybody in the cricket world is excited about the possibility of the U.S. market.”\n\nPlunkett echoes that sentiment. “There’s definitely opportunities,” he says of being in the U.S. “Are you looking to play some good cricket? But also, are you looking to do some business deals and build yourself even further as a brand?”",
    "summary": "**League Progress**: The MLC is in its second season, with 21 matches scheduled to be completed this week, followed by a four-team playoff to determine the champion.\n\n**Attendance and Viewership**: Despite all matches being played in two venues in Texas and North Carolina, attendance is expected to surpass the 70,000 fans from the inaugural season in 2023. The league has partnered with mainstream regional sports networks to broadcast games, potentially increasing viewership.\n\n**Team Operations**: The six teams in the league operate under a $1.15 million salary cap, comparable to other global leagues like Cricket Australia and The Hundred in the UK.\n\n**Player Experience**: Liam Plunkett, a bowler for the San Francisco Unicorns, praises the quality of play in the league, saying it feels like playing anywhere in the world. He also notes that the money is good, and the league offers opportunities for players to build their brand.\n\n**Signings and Recruitment**: The league has made significant signings, including San Francisco's four-year contract with Australia national team captain Pat Cummins. Co-owner Anand Rajaraman notes that the cricket world is excited about the US market, making it relatively easy to attract top talent.",

But launching a new major sports league in the United States has long been a sticky wicket.\n\nBy Sofia Chierchio, Contributor\n\nInside a crowded cricket stadium in Bangalore, India, as the Indian Premier League prepared to begin its inaugural match in April 2008, Anurag Jain gazed at the owner’s balcony as a familiar Hindi song pumped up the many fans in attendance. “Someday, I want to play that song and stand on the balcony like that guy,” he recalls saying. “It wasn’t about vanity; it was about bringing this sport that my family and friends enjoyed together to [America]—my home.”\n\nIn India, cricket is widely considered the most popular sport in the country, both by participation and viewership. Yet as successful as it may be in the UK and other former British colonies, the sport has hardly gained a foothold in the United States. But the 62-year-old Jain—chairman of Access Healthcare, a Dallas-based healthcare company—and a group of deep-pocketed investors—including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan and Jain’s co-owner, Texas real estate developer Ross Perot Jr.—are betting they can finally change that.\n\nIn 2019, American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the San Francisco-based parent company of Major League Cricket (MLC), pledged $1 billion to develop the sport in the U.S. Three years later, MLC secured $120 million in funding. With just six teams—New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Washington, DC—the inaugural 2023 season attracted some 70,000 fans across its games, generating an exceedingly modest $8 million in revenue. With its sophomore season, which began on July 5, underway, MLC is looking to capitalize on surging global interest in the sport, which was bolstered by Team USA’s upset of Pakistan in the Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup in June.\n\n“We're very serious as a collective,” says former Microsoft executive Sanjay Parthasarathy, who co-owns the Seattle Orcas with Nadella. “We're seasoned businesspeople. So, we have a discipline, a business discipline. We're running this like a startup. We're pinching pennies. We've got to invest in the right places so we're not throwing money around for sure.”\n\nMLC’s backers, many of whom are of Indian descent, don’t have to look too far to find a model for success. Established in 2008, the Indian Premier League (IPL) revolutionized cricket by adopting the T20 format, a shorter, more dynamic version of the game. Traditional cricket matches can last for days, but T20 cricket condensed the action into three and a half hours of energetic play, making it more appealing to a wider audience. And the value of IPL clubs has skyrocketed in recent years, with the average value of the league’s 10 teams crossing $1 billion in 2022, according to Forbes’ most recent valuations.\n\nAnd much as Major League Soccer had to overcome the fact that American soccer fans can already watch the world’s best leagues in the United States, the MLC has to contend with an fanbase that is already tuning in to IPL matches on Willow TV, the main broadcaster of cricket in the US.\n\n“The Commonwealth Diaspora has always looked at sports differently than the core American audience,” Parthasarathy says of the TV challenges. “There is an intersection between the diaspora and the hardcore American sports, so there’s a lot of opportunity to be tapped into. That’s the core; it doesn’t mean that’s where we end.”\n\nFor now, according to some owners, the goal for this season is simply to build on the product that debuted last year. The league also has a five-year broadcast partnership with Willow, its most substantial source of revenue. MLC also generates income from ticket sales and sponsorships, taking a page out of the Formula 1 playbook. “One of the biggest sources of income are the logos plastered on our jerseys,” Jain says. “In fact, I think we are the first team to get all of our logo spots sold this year, which I think is an amazing achievement.”\n\nBut if cricket is going to be successful in America, a massive investment in infrastructure is needed. Veteran Silicon Valley venture capitalist Anand Rajaraman, co-owner of the San Francisco Unicorns, estimates that a single purpose-built stadium in the Bay Area would cost at least $30 million.\n\n“You’ve got to have world-class places where people can train and play,” Parthasarathy emphasizes. “You can’t play on a baseball diamond because one of the big aspects of cricket is the pitch. It’s got to be well done and done the right way. Those facilities are really important, and I see that happening over the next 10 years.”\n\nIn addition to infrastructure for stadiums, many MLC owners believe that attracting a broader cricket audience goes hand-in-padded-glove with cultivating domestic talent. According to MLC rules, of the 11 cricketers on the pitch, at least five must be American players. Sanjay Govil, founder of the Maryland-based Infinite Computer Solutions and owner of the Washington Freedom, believes this strategy allows homegrown talent to learn from some of the best international coaches and players.\n\nCricket is expected to get another major boost when it makes its Olympic return in 2028 after a 128-year hiatus. Taking place in Los Angeles, the increased attention could be monumental in growing the new league.\n\n“I think it's extremely important that the world sees cricket at that stage,” Jain claims. “You’ll see how cricket grows because of the Olympics, but most important to us, it's coming here, it's coming to our country.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesIPL Cricket Team Values Would Soar With A $30 Billion Saudi InvestmentForbesThe World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams 2024",

It underlines further the importance of their victory last time out over Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: WLA\n\nMI NEW YORK FORM: A REVERSAL OF FORTUNES ESSENTIAL TO SAVE THEIR SEASON.\n\nLosing three games on the spin heading into this final group game has left MI New York on the outside looking in and even beating the Knight Riders here may not be enough for them to break into the top four. A significant net-run-rate swing is also required for them to overhaul Los Angeles.\n\nLAST THREE: LLL\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nExperience is key for Los Angeles Knight Riders in a contest of such magnitude, which could see bettors turn to all-rounder Andre Russell when it comes to investing in their players here. Russell offers value in multiple markets but with MINY forced to play aggressively with the bat in a bid to pile up quick runs, this may play to the strengths of the West Indian. His variations make backing him to accumulate 2+ wickets a shrewd play.\n\nJason Roy is a player that can so often get whatever team he plays for off to a good start and LAKR will hope for the same on this occasion. Roy struck 27 in a win over rock-bottom Seattle Orcas and even if he wasn’t to gain a really big score, even a cameo could be crucial. Therefore, consider backing Roy to put up over 23.5 match runs.\n\nMI NEW YORK BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWe’ve highlighted the big-hitting abilities of Dewald Brevis previously and the young South African didn’t let bettors down against San Francisco Unicorns last time out, striking 56 from 36 balls. Brevis cleared the boundary rope three times and stakes on him to not only score 20+ runs here, but also to hit over 0.5 match sixes has to be favoured in a must-win game.\n\nTrent Boult’s potency with the ball will be crucial both in the powerplay and the death. Early wickets especially has to be seen as essential for MI New York as they look to overhaul their net-run-rate deficit and the left-arm point of difference that Boult provides is ideal on this front. Back the New Zealander to take over 1.5 match wickets here as he did in his last appearance.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS MI NEW YORK EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nMI New York has no choice but to play fearlessly and aggressively, knowing that they not only need to win here, but win well to overturn the net-run-rate deficit between them and Los Angeles Knight Riders. This could go one of two ways, with either a fired-up and focused MINY blowing away their opponents, or reckless cricket ultimately costing them due to their hand being essentially forced.\n\nBut it’s important to note that LAKR don’t have prior success in this tournament and a bad start here could see doubts creep into the heads of their players. Whereas MINY have been there, done that and won the whole thing, so when it comes to the crunch win or bust games, they know how to get the job done. With that in mind, backing MI New York to win should be seriously considered, the question is whether it will be by enough of a margin to see them through to the play-offs.",
    "summary": "**Match Details:**\nThe article discusses an upcoming match between Los Angeles Knight Riders and MI New York in the Major League Cricket tournament. The match is scheduled to take place on July 21, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\n\n**Current Form:**\nLos Angeles Knight Riders have won their last match and need one more win to guarantee a spot in the eliminator. MI New York, on the other hand, have lost three games in a row and require a significant net-run-rate swing to overhaul Los Angeles and qualify for the play-offs.\n\n**Importance of the Match:**\nThe outcome of this match will decide the fate of both teams. A win for MI New York by a sufficient margin could send them into the play-offs, while a defeat would knock them out of the tournament. Los Angeles Knight Riders, on the other hand, need to win to avoid missing the play-offs for the second consecutive season.\n\n**Key Players:**\nThe article highlights the importance of players like Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Dewald Brevis, and Trent Boult in the match. These players could have a significant impact on the outcome of the game.\n\n**Expert Prediction:**\nThe expert predicts that MI New York will play fearlessly and aggressively, given the desperate situation they are in.

    "date": "Mon Jul 22 02:55:00 2024",
    "body": "It's not just about the cricket or the money, Cummins explains, but the opportunity to think about his career after cricket\n\nMatt Roller\n\n22-Jul-2024 • 6 hrs ago\n\n1:50\n\nCummins: MLC is giving cricketers a platform in the US\n\nPat Cummins does not make Major League Cricket sound like a tough sell. \"It was like, 'do you want to come to the US for a few weeks in summer, be around a team where I'm good mates with a few of the guys, play a bit of golf and play a bit of cricket in a new country',\" he tells ESPNcricinfo from Dallas. \"I jumped at it.\"\n\nYet his lucrative four-year contract with San Francisco Unicorns was a paradigm of change in the cricket world. Cummins had only previously played in one overseas T20 league - the IPL - but his interest was piqued by the identity of the franchise's owners: Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, a pair of India-born venture capitalists based in California.\n\nFive injury-ruined years early in his career made Cummins acutely aware that professional sport is transitory. He studied business at Sydney's University of Technology during his prolonged rehabilitation, sits on the Australian Cricketers' Association's board of directors, and has used his platform to advocate for action on climate change.\n\nIt is why the owners' Silicon Valley background was the clincher for him. \"It's a space that I find super interesting, particularly the venture-capital world,\" Cummins says. \"I potentially see that as something I'd like to do more of post-cricket, so [this is] a way to align with a few of those guys, learn off them over the next few years, be around some of those conversations.\"\n\nThe tournament effectively provides him with a chance to network: since arriving in the US, Cummins has already \"informally\" discussed potential opportunities over coffee. \"If it's something I do enjoy, hopefully I could dive a little bit deeper for the back-end of my career, and then maybe move into that space a bit more professionally after cricket.\"\n\n\"For the guys that play all three formats, you're always trying to make sure you're peaking for those major events - and it feels like there's been about ten major events in the last 18 months, so I haven't really taken much time to reinvest back in my body\"\n\nPat Cummins\n\nCummins' contract with Unicorns runs until 2027. By then, he will be 34 and closer to the end of his international career. \"The intention is definitely to make this a long-term partnership,\" he says. \"Obviously playing for Australia, it's going to clash at certain times. But outside of that, I want to make sure MLC is a real focus.\"\n\nMLC remains at a nascent stage, with just 25 matches shared across two venues. But its combination of high salaries, a short window, and the novelty of playing in the US have proved attractive. Its pool of overseas players comfortably outstrips that of rival leagues, including the Hundred in England. \"I hadn't thought of the Hundred,\" Cummins admits.\n\nCummins makes it clear that, as Test and ODI captain, \"playing for Australia will come first\". Cricket Australia only made him available for four out of six MLC group games this year to manage his workload after the T20 World Cup, and his availability for the 2025 edition will depend on a potential clash with a two-match Test series in the Caribbean.\n\nHe has also been rested for Australia's white-ball tour to Scotland and England in September, giving him a prolonged break ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Tellingly, that decision received minimal pushback.\n\n\"Everyone's a little bit more realistic about the schedules nowadays,\" Cummins says. \"We spend ten-plus months of the year away on the road, so some tours probably carry a little bit more importance than others. For the guys that play all three formats, you're always trying to make sure you're peaking for those major events - and it feels like there's been about ten major events in the last 18 months, so I haven't really taken much time to reinvest back in my body.\"\n\n1:38\n\nCummins explains why he will miss the September tour to England\n\nJosh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc are part of September's tour, but Cummins had long planned to miss it. \"That window has always been earmarked as a time to really give my body a rest and do close to a full pre-season,\" he explains. \"I should get six or eight weeks off bowling and then build up again. Once this MLC opportunity came up and we mapped out the plan, it didn't really change much.\n\n\"I still get that same amount of break and then just probably start one or two weeks later heading into the summer… I'll get home, I'll have a good six or eight weeks off bowling where I'll get in the gym every day, do some running, and get some strength back into my body. And then we've got a big Test match series [against India] for our home summer, so that'll be the focus.\"\n\nCummins has only taken one wicket in three MLC appearances, but has helped Unicorns seal a top-two finish, closing out a win over MI New York on Friday night. \"It's a really high standard,\" he says. \"The calibre of players is ridiculous and for a competition in its second season, it's super organised and super competitive… I couldn't speak highly enough of it.\"\n\nAustralia played exclusively in the Caribbean during the T20 World Cup, but Cummins watched the US leg with interest: \"That Pakistan-India game looked insane… everyone talks about baseball, basketball and NFL, but there's hundreds of thousands of cricketers here going about their work quietly who are now starting to get a platform.\"\n\nUnicorns' long-term ambition is to bring MLC to California, with plans to build a stadium in San Jose. \"Hopefully that will be ready to go in the next couple of years, and I'll be coming back to San Fran a lot,\" Cummins says. That sentence alone from Australia's captain is proof that cricket has changed for good.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",

Except for Ryan Rickelton, no other batter showed any promise whatsoever. The big names like Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen and Aaron Jones, all failed to get going. Rickelton smashed 89 off 52 balls but he barely got any support at the other end. Once he got out in the 19th over, it was all clear that Orcas will not reach a decent total. They were littled and only scored 142 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Sunil Narine as usual got out cheaply. Jason Roy tried his best to take control but he consumed too many balls for his knock of 27 runs. A real game changing innings was played by Unmukt Chand, who smashed 62 runs off 47 balls.

The middle order of San Francisco Unicorns came good as Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan smashed 59 and 44 runs respectively to help San Francisco Unicorns get to a strong total of 148 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, MI New York lost Ruben Clinton quite early into the innings. Dewald Brevis played like a champion and he smashed 56 runs off 36 balls. He instilled the hope for a successful chase. Nicholas Pooran also supported him well, he scored 26 runs but consumed too many balls to get going. It cost the team dearly. The rest of the middle order batters including Romario Shepherd and Monank Patel failed terribly and despite the efforts of Heath Richards, who smashed 24 off 13 balls, Seattle Orcas failed to achieve the target and fell short by 3 runs in the end.\n\nWicket Takers T20",

It was MI New York who took home the win and qualified in the fourth spot for the playoffs. However, we will be back with more coverage of the Major League cricket on 23rd July. It will be a top-of-the-table clash between San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom. The first ball will be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT) but our coverage will start much earlier. Until then, goodbye and cheers!\n\nKieron Pollard the skipper of MI New York is up for a chat. He says that he is happy and congratulates his entire team for their performance. Adds that they were good with the bat in this tournament but the results were not in their favor. Mentions that this win was a complete team performance and it gave a lot of confidence to everyone. Ends by saying that their hard work paid off and will perform well further as well.\n\nSunil Narine, the captain of the Los Angeles Knight Riders is up for a chat. He says that they were some runs short and the innings by Pooran and Pollard took the game away from them. Jokes that he will have to improve his skills at the toss. Adds that batting first is always tough but it was a good tournament for them. Mentions that they tried their best and appreciates his bowlers for giving it their all. Ends by saying that they will keep fighting and that he is happy with the team balance.\n\nRashid Khan is the Player of the Match for his impactful bowling spell. He says that the win was a much needed one. Adds that the wickets he took were crucial. Adds that it was all about bowling in the right areas and that went well. Says that everything went perfect for him. Ends by saying that they will look to carry on with the momentum and try to win the next game.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw the Los Angeles Knight Riders batters struggling against MI New York. Trent Boult, Nosthush Kenjige, and Rashid Khan got wickets and put the Knight Riders in a tough spot. However, a late boost by Andre Russell took them to a competitive total and gave some relief to their bowlers.\n\nNicholas Pooran says that he is happy with the win and they believed. Adds that they have been in similar situations before and they did well. He says that Kieron Pollard played the role of finisher well and he has all the experience. Ends by saying that they will give their best in the playoffs.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders executed their plan well. The pacers troubled the batters initially and Spencer Johnson gave them the opening wicket. Corne Dry soon followed and cleared the path for the rest of the bowlers. Sunil Narine and Andre Russell put further pressure with quick wickets. Johnson was shown a glimpse of vintage Pollard and that over, changed the momentum of the game. Ali Khan got rid of Pooran but the damage was already done. They couldn't make the cut this year but will hope to make a strong comeback next year.\n\nMI New York had a struggling start to their innings. They had to chase down the target in 18.2 over to qualify and Ruben Clinton couldn’t get going. He succumbed under pressure and so did Dewald Brevis. Nicholas Pooran couldn’t find an ideal partner to attack from both ends as Monank Patel, Heath Richards, and Romario Shepherd also crumbled under pressure. Kieron Pollard was at his best and he hit three sixes in Spencer Johnson’s one over to get his team right back in the game. In the end, Rashid Khan and Kieron Pollard sealed the game in their favor. The defending champions will once again have the chance to compete for the coveted trophy.\n\nMI NEW YORK HAVE MANAGED TO QUALIFY FOR THE PLAYOFFS!

A difficult chance though.\n\nTime Out! MI New York have lost Nicholas Pooran here but it won't matter much. They just need 5 runs off 16 balls to qualify for the playoffs. Rashid Khan comes on the crease now.\n\nW\n\nOvers15.4\n\nScore126 - 6\n\nAli Khan to Nicholas Pooran, OUT! LBW! The finger goes up and Nicholas Pooran refers again.

Pooran then anchored most of the chase with an innings of 35 for 28, before being caught LBW by Ali Khan.\n\nHowever, the finishing touch came from Pollard, who showcased his immense power by smashing three consecutive sixes off Spencer Johnson, effectively sealing the game. He finished with an unbeaten 33 off just 12 balls, striking the ball at a rate of 275, to seal the win.\n\nEarlier, MI New York justified the decision to bowl first after delivering an exceptional bowling performance to bolster their playoff ambitions. They dominated from the powerplay on a slightly slow surface.\n\nJason Roy started well with a 23-ball 27 at the top, but the Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) struggled to find momentum, with a series of single-digit scores plaguing their middle order.\n\nMINY's bowlers maintained tight lines and lengths, making it difficult for LAKR to break free during the middle overs. Rashid Khan and Trent Boult turned back the clock with their strong showcase, as regular wickets further hampered LAKR's progress, and they appeared on the verge of a subpar total. However, a late onslaught by Russell, who hammered a quickfire 35 from just 21 balls, salvaged the innings and pushed LAKR to a somewhat respectable 130.\n\nWith this victory, MINY have completed the playoffs lineup and will now face the Texas Super Kings in what promises to be a thrilling Eliminator clash.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Fall of wickets: 1-17 (Sunil Narine - 1.5 ov), 2-42 (Unmukt Chand - 5.3 ov), 3-50 (Jason Roy - 6.4 ov), 4-55 (David Miller - 8.6 ov), 5-78 (Saif Badar - 12.3 ov), 6-80 (Nitish Kumar - 13.4 ov), 7-81 (Corne Dry - 14.2 ov), 8-100 (Spencer Johnson - 15.6 ov), 9-102 (Ali Khan - 16.1 ov), 10-130 (Andre Russell - 19.1 ov)\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-32 (Ruben Clinton - 4.5 ov), 2-36 (Dewald Brevis - 5.3 ov), 3-42 (Monank Patel - 7.5 ov), 4-78 (Heath Richards - 12.1 ov), 5-91 (Romario Shepherd - 13.2 ov), 6-126 (Nicholas Pooran - 15.4 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nKnight Riders\n\nJason Roy\n\nSunil Narine(C)\n\nUnmukt Chand(WK)\n\nDavid Miller\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nSaif Badar\n\nAndre Russell\n\nCorne Dry\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nAli Khan\n\nJosh Little\n\nMI New York\n\nDewald Brevis\n\nRuben Clinton\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nMonank Patel\n\nRomario Shepherd\n\nRashid Khan\n\nHeath Richards\n\nTrent Boult\n\nRushil Ugarkar\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Monday, July 22, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: MI New York elected to bowl",

Pooran then anchored most of the chase with an innings of 35 for 28, before being caught LBW by Ali Khan.\n\nHowever, the finishing touch came from Pollard, who showcased his immense power by smashing three consecutive sixes off Spencer Johnson, effectively sealing the game. He finished with an unbeaten 33 off just 12 balls, striking at a rate of 275, to seal the win.\n\nEarlier, MI New York justified the decision to bowl first after delivering an exceptional bowling performance to bolster their playoff ambitions. They dominated from the powerplay on a slightly slow surface.\n\nJason Roy started well with a 23-ball 27 at the top, but the Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) struggled to find momentum, with a series of single-digit scores plaguing their middle order.\n\nMINY's bowlers maintained tight lines and lengths, making it difficult for LAKR to break free during the middle overs. Rashid Khan and Trent Boult turned back the clock with their strong showcase, as regular wickets further hampered LAKR's progress, and they appeared on the verge of a subpar total. However, a late onslaught by Russell, who hammered a quickfire 35 from just 21 balls, salvaged the innings and pushed LAKR to a somewhat respectable 130.\n\nMLC 2024 Playoffs\n\nWith this victory, MINY have completed the playoffs lineup and will now face the Texas Super Kings in what promises to be a thrilling Eliminator clash. On the other hand, Washington Freedom will take on San Francisco Unicorns in the Qualifier 1.\n\nBrief Scores: MI New York (Nicholas Pooran 35, Kieron Pollard 33, Sunil Narine 2/24) beat LA Knight Riders (Jason Roy 27, Andre Russell 35, Rashid Khan 3/22) by 4 wickets.\n\n(An Excerpt from Agency)",

    "body": "The Washington Freedom secured a convincing 42-run victory over the Texas Super Kings in the 17th match of Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC), played at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nDwayne Bravo Fools Smith\n\nOn the fourth ball of the 18th over, with Washington’s score at 186/4, Dwayne Bravo delivered a decisive blow to Smith Smith. Facing the experienced Smith, Bravo bowls a slower delivery that proved a masterclass in deception.\n\nAnticipating a faster ball, Smith had committed himself early and moved significantly outside off stump. Bravo’s slower ball was expertly disguised and delivered with precision, skirting close to the stumps. Brought off balance by the change of pace, Smith attempted to swipe across the line but missed entirely, his shot falling well short of connecting.\n\nHowever, on the next delivery, he again used a subtle variation in pace and trajectory to induce an error from Smith. This time, Smith misjudged the ball and attempted a shot that resulted in a straightforward catch for Devon Conway behind the stumps.

    "body": "Kicking off cricket in the United States of America has been a dream for many years and that dream was finally realised in 2023 when the first edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC) competition was played. And right from that first season, we saw big sixes, high scores, electrifying fielding, and much more.\n\nWhile we’ve spoken about the top bowlers and batters in this league, we’re going to list down all Major League Cricket centuries on this page. Since it’s a global league with top T20 players signed from USA and around the world, you’ll find players from different countries being a part of the MLC centuries list. Keep reading for more details…\n\nThe first ever Major League Cricket century was scored by South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen, proving why he’s known as one of the best cricketers in the world in this format. And right after him a few days later, we saw another highly sought T20 batter in Nicholas Pooran who bagged himself an MLC century, doing so in the all-important MLC 2023 final.\n\nSEE ALSO: List of top online sports betting websites\n\nPost that, we saw a couple of more South African players (Faf du Plessis and Ryan Rickelton) getting MLC centuries and when we last updated this page, there were a total of four (4) centuries in this league.

Not only was it scored at a 250 strike rate but it came in an important final when his team was down initially. It’s also the highest score in MLC’s short history so far, getting 137* in just 55 deliveries.\n\nTill date, Seattle Orcas is the only franchise to have multiple entries in the MLC centuries list thanks to tons from Klaasen and Rickelton. A few teams are few to enter this list but considering there’s plenty of successful seasons to come over the years, we expect more entries in this list over the years.\n\nThree of the four centuries scored in this tournament have ended on a winning note while Faf’s centuries in MLC 2024 went in vain as the match was washed out due to rain after his century in the first innings.

Rachin Ravindra registered his best figures in T20 cricket with impressive stats of 4/16, while Jasdeep Singh finished with three wickets as we continued our unbeaten run this season. Earlier, Maxwell scored 34 off 23 balls to power us to 206/5.\n\nTravis Head smashed his third consecutive fifty to lead us to the highest total by any team in the MLC this season. Head amassed 53 off just 22 balls, hitting eight fours and two sixes. Meanwhile, our skipper Steve Smith scored 57 off 40 balls, including three sixes and two fours, to top-score in the contest.\n\nBatting first, Head got into the act quickly with two boundaries in the first over of the innings. The southpaw continued unabated, scoring five fours and a six in just 10 balls, reaching his fifty in only 20 balls.\n\nHead’s carnage pushed us to 74/2 at the end of the sixth over, equaling the second-highest powerplay score of MLC 2024. Although we lost three wickets in quick succession, Maxwell and Smith rebuilt our innings, adding 58 off 42 balls and taking us past the three-figure mark.\n\nMaxwell was severe on the spinners, hitting all his boundaries—three sixes and a four—against the slower bowlers. After a cautious start, Smith shifted gears effortlessly, reaching his first fifty of the MLC in style with a reverse hit for four.\n\nSmith, who was at 24 off 25 balls initially, smashed 33 runs off the next 14 balls before getting dismissed in the penultimate over. Obus Pienaar provided the finishing touches, scoring an unbeaten 21-ball 33 to take us past 200. Noor Ahmad picked up 3/38 for Texas Super Kings whereas Dwayne Bravo got two wickets.\n\nIn response, Maxwell once again provided the crucial breakthrough dismissing Devon Conway. However, TSK raced to 76/1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nBut we bounced back, picking up four wickets and conceding just 29 runs in the next six overs. Player of the Match Jasdeep dismissed TSK skipper du Plessis, who was looking in good nick, immediately after his fifty, to tilt the odds heavily in our favour.\n\nOnce Marcus Stoinis holed out in the deep to be Jasdeep’s third victim, there was no looking back as we romped home for our fifth victory of the season. Jasdeep recorded figures of 3/25 to round off a clinical bowling display.\n\nWith 11 points from six matches, we continue to be on top of the MLC 2024 points table.\n\nWe are up against the San Francisco Unicorns in our last league match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday.\n\nWashington Freedom vs Texas Super Kings MLC 2024 brief scores: WF 206/5 in 20 overs (Steve Smith 57, Travis Head 53, Noor Ahmad 3/38, Dwayne Bravo 2/40) vs TSK 164/10 in 19.5 overs (Faf du Plessis 55, Calvin Savage 35, Rachin Ravindra 4/16, Jasdeep Singh 3/25).\n\nWashington Freedom won by 42 runs.",

However, Faf du Plessis and TSK rewrote both records during the chase. Head also has the most fifties by any player this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Smith endured a slow start to go big in the later stage guiding the team to its first 200-plus total in MLC. He also scored his first half-century in the process.\n\nJasdeep Singh won the Player of the Match for a second straight match with an impressive three-wicket haul. He was reintroduced into the attack after the powerplay when TSK were flying high.\n\nJasdeep brought us back into the match with a spell of 3/17 in his last three overs, including the wickets of the dangerous du Plessis and Aaron Hardy.

However, they are both talented players and will look to the experienced pair of Sunil Narine and Andre Russell for tips ahead of this clash.\n\nLAKR Team Form\n\nIt was four matches without a victory before Los Angeles Knight Riders’ win in their last game.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Predicted Playing 11\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine (c), Unmukt Chand (wk), David Miller, Nitish Kumar, Saif Badar, Andre Russell, Corne Dry, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan, Waqar Salamkheil\n\nMI New York Team News & Playing 11\n\nMINY Team News\n\nWith only Seattle Orcas below them in the table, and only a one point cushion above them, it has been a desperately disappointing tournament for MI New York and they lost their last game by three runs against San Francisco Unicorns on Thursday.\n\nMINY Team Batting\n\nSouth African Dewald Brevis struck a quick-fire and impressive 56 runs from 36 balls in the last game and he made an exciting 77 for the second wicket with Nicholas Pooran. Captain Pooran has not been in the greatest form but his side need him to be at his best in this game if they are to progress up the table.\n\nMINY Team Bowling\n\nThere is no doubt that MI New York have a strong bowling attack and in spinner Rashid Khan along with left-arm opening bowler Trent Boult they have two of T20s all time best bowlers. Nosthush Kenjige comes into this game after an excellent performance with the ball in Dallas in Match 16.\n\nMINY Team Form\n\nMI New York have not won any of their last five matches in the 2024 MLC.\n\nMI New York Predicted Playing 11\n\nDewald Brevis, Ruben Clinton, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Kieron Pollard (c), Monank Patel, Romario Shepherd, Rashid Khan, Heath Richards, Sunny Patel, Nosthush Kenjige, Trent Boult",

Their bowling looks strong too with the inclusion of Rashid Khan in the squad. Considering their squad strength, MI New York will start as favorites for winning the tournament.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Nicholas Pooran - He played brilliantly in the last edition of the Major League Cricket. He was the top run scorer for the season. Pooran is an exciting player who can change the course of the game in a matter of few balls.\n\n2. Rashid Khan - One of the best T20 spinners in World Cricket, Khan will be vested with the responsibility of putting a leash on to the opponents with his tight bowling.\n\nCurrent Form Seattle Orcas:\n\nSeattle Orcas are the runners up of the Major League Cricket. They lost the Final match of the last edition.\n\nThe top run scorer for Seattle Orcas in the previous edition was Quinton de Kock with 264 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Seattle Orcas in the previous edition was Cameron Gannon with 11 scalps under his belt.\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup hero for USA, Harmeet Singh is a part of the Seattle Orcas squad. He will add a great dimension to their team. Heinrich Klaasen, Quinton de Kock and Nathan Ellis are also part of the squad. Seattle Orcas are looking good on papers and should go a long way in the tournament.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Quinton de Kock - He looked in sublime touch in the recently concluded ICC Men's T20 World Cup and almost won the match for South Africa in the Finals. Quinton de Kock will play an important role for Seattle Orcas in the upcoming matches.\n\n2. Nathan Ellis - He is one of the best T20 bowlers in World cricket. Ellis can take early wickets in the Powerplay overs and put pressure on to the opposition.\n\nLet’s have a look at the squads:\n\nMI New York\n\nNicholas Pooran, Shayan Jahangir, Nosthusha Kenjige, Dewald Brevis, Rushil Ugarkar, Ruben Clinton, Anrich Nortje, Monank Patel, Steven Taylor, Romario Shepherd, Trent Boult, Ehsan Adil, Tim David, Heath Richards, Kagiso Rabada, Rashid Khan, Kieron Pollard\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nNandre Burger, Harmeet Singh, Obed McCoy, Nathan Ellis, Shubham Ranjane, Andrew Tye, Angelo Perera, Hayden Walsh, Nauman Anwar, Michael Bracewell, Dwaine Pretorius, Nisarg Patel, Shimron Hetmyer, Cameron Gannon, Dasun Shanaka, Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen, Shehan Jayasuriya, Wayne Parnell, Quinton de Kock, Ryan Rickelton, Imad Wasim, Phani Simhardi\n\nCricket Betting Tips and Match Predictions* - PrePlay\n\nWho will win the toss? – MI New York\n\nWho will win?- MI New York\n\nTop Batter (Runs Scored) - Nicholas Pooran (MI New York), Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas)\n\nTop Bowler (Wickets taken) - Rashid Khan (MI New York), Nathan Ellis (Seattle Orcas)\n\nMost Sixes – Nicholas Pooran (MI New York), Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas)\n\nPlayer of the Match- Rashid Khan (MI New York)\n\nTeam Scores Batting first – MI New York 160+, Seattle Orcas 150+\n\nMatch Handicap: MI New York\n\nWicket Takers T20\n\nLIVE SCORES - Match 2 - LA Knight Riders vs Texas Super Kings (Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas)\n\nCurrent Form LA Knight Riders:\n\nLA Knight Riders finished at the bottom most position on points table in the previous season of Major League Cricket. They managed to win only one match out of the 5 games they participated in.\n\nThe top run scorer for LA Knight Riders in the previous edition was Andre Russell with 206 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for LA Knight Riders in the previous edition was Adam Zampa with 9 scalps under his belt.\n\nLA Knight Riders have retained their premium spinner Adam Zampa. He was the leading wicket taker for LA Knight Riders last season. They also have capable batters in Andre Russell, Jason Roy and David Miller. Sunil Narine, who is in the form of his life is also part of the LA Knight Riders squad.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Sunil Narine - He showed great signs of form in the recently concluded Indian Premier League. He can change the course of the match both with bat and the ball. Narine is expected to be LA Knight Riders' best player in the Major League Cricket.\n\n2. Jason Roy - He is an experienced campaigner who is capable of playing long innings and placing the opposition under pressure right from the word go.\n\nCurrent Form Texas Super Kings:\n\nTexas Super Kings finished at the 2nd position on points table after league stages of the previous edition.

They do match winners in their team like Gerald Coetzee, Daniel Sams and Devon Conway. However, their chances for making it to the Playoffs are bleak.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Faf du Plessis- He can hit the ball a long way and provide quick starts to his team in the powerplay overs. Faf du Plessis will play an important role for Texas Super Kings in the tournament.\n\n2.

The Bangla tigers will take on their next-door neighbours in two Tests and three T20Is which begin from September 19 to October 12.\n\nThe all-rounder has already left for the USA on July 1 to take part in the Los Angeles Knight Riders’ upcoming season in Major League cricket. He suggested that he is not thinking too far ahead and remains focused on taking part in MLC followed by Canada’s Global T20 League.\n\n“I don’t have many plans. There are two T20 tournaments in front of me one is MLC and the other one is the Global T20 League in Canada. Let me see where I stand after playing these two tournaments because I need to understand (how I feel),” said Shakib as quoted by Cricbuzz.\n\nREAD MORE: From IGI Airport to ITC Maurya Hotel – Delhi Police Provide Security Arrangements for Team India’s Arrival\n\nHe does not feel that he has the time to think too far into the future and has resorted to focusing more on the short-term and will think of his next move following the Pakistan tour where they will take part in a two-match Test series.\n\nShakib’s performances with both bat and ball have certainly not lived up to his lofty standards. He finished the T20 World Cup 2024 with only 111 runs in the seven games he was a part of and his strike rate was disastrous at just 106.73. With the ball, he ended up with just three wickets through the campaign.\n\nREAD MORE: PCB Chairman Advised Against Massive Changes in Pakistan Team Due To Pressure From Senior Players\n\nThe south-paw has been featuring for the Bangladesh side for quite some time and his recent performances have warranted questions from the likes of Virender Sehwag who questioned whether it was time for him to give his spot to someone younger, keeping the future in perspective.\n\nSo far Shakib has not done anything to indicate that he might call time on his international career. He, however, continues to regularly feature in franchise cricket across many leagues and his experience will be key to returning to his best form.",

    "body": "Bangladesh star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan said he preferred to make short-term plans rather than long-term ones, considering that the 37-year-old is in the twilight of his career.\n\nShakib left for the USA earlier today to take part in the upcoming season of Major League Cricket, starting on July 6. He will play for the Los Angeles Knight Riders and will then make the journey across the border to play for Bangla Tigers Mississauga in the Global T20 in Canada which will begin on July 25.\n\nFollowing the back-to-back franchise tournaments, Shakib will be expected to return to national colours in August when Bangladesh will tour Pakistan for a two-match Test series.\n\n\"I haven't really planned much. And I don't really have that much time to plan for three-four years. I think that it is good to plan for three months, or six months. So up until now, my planning goes as far as the Pakistan series,\" Shakib told reporters at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport before leaving for the USA on Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't have a plan regarding myself. At this moment, I'm looking forward to the two T20 tournaments, one is Major League Cricket for which I'm heading to the USA followed by the Global T20 League in Canada. I'll play these back-to-back tournaments and then will see where things are. After that, there is the Test series against Pakistan. So, my planning is about these three competitions.\"\n\nShakib has been going through a lean patch with both bat and ball. While his batting has left a lot to be desired in the past two ICC events (the 2023 ODI World Cup and 2020 T20 World Cup), his ability to strike with the ball, which has rarely come into question throughout his career, has taken a nosedive.\n\nIn an abysmal campaign in the recently concluded T20 World Cup, Shakib managed just 111 runs in seven matches at a strike-rate of 106.73. He did score a fifty against the Netherlands in their Super 8 run in the tournament but that was all that one would remember from his campaign. With the ball, he picked up three wickets at an economy rate of 7.50 and it was not until Bangladesh's fourth match of the group-stage against Nepal that the left-arm spinner was able to register his first wicket. He took two in the match and scalped one in a Super 8 fixture against India meaning he went wicketless in five matches in the major event.\n\nThe interesting part about Shakib's statement was that he was not particularly keen on long-term plans and it won't be a surprise if he is picky when deciding which matches to play in the upcoming series. There have been a few instances in which Shakib has opted out of Tests in the recent past. Moreover, his sporadic absences have often left the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) struggling to explain the reasoning behind his unavailability. So, BCB would have a hard time planning ahead with Shakib in the mix but the loop of the board chasing the Bangladesh star for his availability may very well continue.",

Undoubtedly, they have one of the strongest and most formidable sides in this competition.\n\nSeveral USA cricketers in the form of Monank Patel, Steven Taylor and Shayan Jahangir will be players to watch out for as Kieron Pollard and co. look to defend their title.\n\nIn this article, we take a look at 3 reasons why MI New York can defend their title in Major League Cricket 2024:\n\n1. Well-rounded balanced side\n\nMI New York have a lot of superstars in their team and all of them would be looking to sparkle together in order to win something big in the 2nd edition of the Major League Cricket 2024.\n\nThe batting department has some big guns in the form of Nicholas Pooran, Tim David and Kieron Pollard. On the other hand, the bowlers in the form of Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult and Sunny Singh will be looking to leave a mark.\n\n2. Able leadership\n\nMI New York’s captain Kieron Pollard has served the Mumbai-branch of the MI franchise for 14 long seasons and is also the present batting coach of Mumbai Indians. He is a vastly experienced campaigner and has won a lot of titles in this T20 franchise cricketing career.\n\nPollard had sustained a shoulder injury in the last league game of MI New York in the previous edition and therefore Nicholas Pooran, had to don the captain’s hat.\n\nThe swashbuckling southpaw led the team extremely well and also played a jaw-dropping innings in the finals to lift the title. Pooran had smashed 137* runs in 55 deliveries and had sent shockwaves down the spines of the opposition team.\n\n3. Quality domestic talent\n\nMI New York have USA’s cricket team’s captain Monank Patel in their ranks and also have Steven Taylor. Both these players had a good outing in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and would be confident of good performances in this competition.\n\nLeft-arm orthodox spinner Nosthush Kenjige will be another key talent to watch out for and he has grown in confidence, in the last few years. Kenjige had bagged 3 wickets in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 for USA.",

The series, scheduled from September 19 to October 12, includes two Tests and three T20Is. This uncertainty follows Bangladesh’s tour of Pakistan in August, where they will play a two-match Test series.\n\nFocus on T20 Leagues: Shakib Al Hasan\n\nShakib al Hasan, who departed for the USA on July 1 to play for the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the Major League Cricket, stated that his current plans only extend to the Pakistan tour.\n\n“I don’t have many plans. There are two T20 tournaments ahead: the MLC and the Global T20 League in Canada. I’ll reassess my position after these tournaments,” Shakib told reporters before leaving for the USA as per Cricbuzz.\n\nHe emphasised the need for short-term planning given his age and experience. “Planning for three to six months is more realistic for me now, and I’ll decide on my next steps after the Pakistan series,” he added.\n\nTaskin Ahmed apology confirmed by Shakib\n\nIn related news, Shakib Al Hasan confirmed that pace bowler Taskin Ahmed had apologised to his teammates for missing the team bus ahead of their Super 8 clash against India in the ICC T20 World Cup. Taskin’s tardiness led to his late arrival at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, missing the game against India.\n\n“The team bus leaves at a fixed time, and if a player misses it, they must find alternate transportation. Taskin arrived just minutes before the toss, making it impossible to include him in the playing XI,” Shakib explained. “Taskin apologised to the team, and everyone accepted it as an honest mistake.”\n\nFuture Plans and Senior Farewells\n\nBCB President Nazmul Hasan indicated that the board is planning a fitting farewell for senior players Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, and Mahmudullah, who are nearing the end of their careers.",

    "body": "The Major League Cricket, MLC 2024 is knocking at the doorstep, as the second edition of the tournament begins on Saturday. With its inaugural season played in 2023, the MI New York were the standout performers in the league and went on to be the champions under skipper Nick Pooran, who played a stunning hand in their title victory.\n\nWith some very crucial signings, especially with the drafting of several Australian maestros ahead of the 2nd edition, the MLC will be a contest worth witnessing.\n\nWith a new set of players, along with the retained players from the first season, let’s take a look at the Top 5 batters who stand a chance to score the highest runs ahead of MLC 2024.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTop 5 batters who stand a chance to score the highest runs ahead of MLC 2024\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have drafted the big Australian for their 2024 MLC campaign. The last time semifinalists had already had quite some spectacular performers in their team sheets, while Stoinis will be an in-form inclusion to the side.\n\nThe big Australian was a commanding performer in the Indian Premier League and also performed overwhelmingly for his national side in the T20 World Cup. Stoinis, who has evolved to be a middle-order batter, letting go of his role as a finisher has helped sides retain him, and his evolving bowling skills are a cherry on top.\n\nQuinton de Kock\n\nThe South African veteran, who announced his retirement from the Tests and ODIs, has been a constant surprise in the shortest format of the game. He has been a part of every global T20 league since he stopped featuring for the Proteas.\n\nPlaying for the Seattle Orcas, QDK scored 264 runs, averaging a brilliant 44 in the 7 games of the tournament. He is one of the most worthy retentions of the MLC 2024, and his contributions are supposed to be of great value to his team. In short, the veteran can once again be found among the top scorers of the league.\n\nYOU MAY LIKE IT: IND vs ZIM: 3 bowlers to watch out for in India’s tour of Zimbabwe who can be assets in the T20 World Cup 2026\n\nJ.Fraser-McGurk\n\nThe hard-hitting youngster from Australia is now gaining the status of a world-class T20 batter due to his fearless stride and fast run-scoring in the powerplay, for which he has often received praise and recognition from players around the world.\n\nFeaturing for the Delhi Capitals in the IPL 2024, McGurk was one of the very reasons the Capitals bounced back in the later stages of the competition. Though he was not the most consistent performer, he added fire to the innings whenever he got going in the powerplay.\n\nSuch will be his role, as the 21-year-old is about to make his debut in yet another league featuring players of global standard. Picked by the San Francisco Unicorns, McGruk will be most probably seen alongside Finn Allen, and together they can be the most explosive opening pair of MLC 2024.\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nThe West Indies wk-bat has been a constant performer over the recent few years, in whichever league he has played in. From playing in the IPL for Lucknow Super Giants to making vital contributions to his team’s score in the T20 World Cup, Pooran is one of the most reliable batters to keep your cards on.\n\nThe small-packet dynamite is often seen hitting massive sixes; it was his blistering knock of 137 runs on just 55 balls that included 13 sixes, which took MI New York over the line, and they went on to be the champions of the debut season. Not only MI New York but the entire cricket world would hope to witness such brilliance from the Windies batter.\n\nTravis Head",
    "summary": "The second edition of the MLC is set to begin on Saturday, with the MI New York being the defending champions after winning the inaugural season in 2023 under skipper Nick Pooran. Several Australian players have been drafted into the tournament, making it an exciting contest to watch. The article highlights the top 5 batters who are likely to score the highest runs in MLC 2024, including:\n\n1. Marcus Stoinis, who was drafted by the Texas Super Kings and is expected to perform well after his impressive showings in the Indian Premier League and the T20 World Cup.\n2. Quinton de Kock, who will play for the Seattle Orcas and is expected to continue his good form in the shortest format of the game.\n3. J. Fraser-McGurk, a young Australian batsman who is making his MLC debut with the San Francisco Unicorns and is known for his fearless and fast-scoring abilities.\n4. Nicholas Pooran, the West Indies wicketkeeper-batsman who is a consistent performer in various leagues and was instrumental in MI New York's title win in the inaugural season.\n5. Travis Head, an Australian batsman who is expected to perform well in the tournament.\n\nOverall, the article suggests that MLC 2024 is shaping up to be an exciting tournament with a strong lineup of players.",

    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nLast season’s Major League Cricket runners’ up, the Seattle Orcas, come into this one on the back of a difficult season so far whereby they are fighting for a place in the next phase as they come up against a San Francisco Unicorns side that were thumped by the Texas Super Kings in their most recent outing.\n\nDATE & TIME: Monday 15th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:00pm / USA PT – 12:00pm / West Indies – 2:00pm / UK – 8:00pm / South Africa – 9:00pm / Tuesday 16th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:00am / India – 12:30am / Bangladesh – 1:00am / Australia – 10:00pm\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 36c or 96.8 F with clear, sunny skies\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS FORM: MUST REACT FROM THUMPING\n\nSeattle Orcas most recently suffered a hammering at the hands of an impressive Washington Freedom side at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas last week. They were bowled out for just 124 in 19.4 overs before Freedom cruised through with an eight-wicket victory. The Orcas currently sit at the bottom-of-the-table.\n\nLAST THREE: LWLLW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: MUST REACT FROM THUMPING\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns come into this one on the back of their own shaky start to the 2024 Major League Cricket season. Their most recent played match, ignoring the abandonment against the Los Angeles Knight Riders, saw them hammered by the Texas Super Kings with the Unicorns being bowled out for just 127 before TSK chased it in 12.5 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: ALWLL\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Seattle Orcas have reshuffled their top order already in this tournament with Quinton de Kock moving down to three behind Ryan Rickelton and Nauman Anwar. De Kock has been in poor form for some time now, though, and the Orcas’ best bet of getting runs has been via captain Heinrich Klaasen with Klaasen scoring 30+ seemingly always a good option.\n\nIt is a fairly weak attack that the Orcas possess with the likes of Imad Wasim, Nandre Burger, Cameron Gannon, Harmeet Singh and Zaman Khan providing little potency. That said, it is South African Burger that has often looked to be the most controlled and Burger to be the Orcas’ top bowler would be a reasonable shout.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIt is a modern day top order for the San Francisco Unicorns and it is a top order that should look to threaten most bowling attacks. Josh Inglis has been demoted down to five with Sanjay Krishnamurthi moving up but neither of those players their biggest threat. That falls on the shoulders of Matthew Short and whilst the Australian is hit and miss so 30+ is not always as likely as the aforementioned Klaasen, he is likely to be the Unicorns’ top batter in the match.\n\nHaris Rauf and Liam Plunkett are symbols of what is an ageing and actually ineffective Unicorns’ bowling attack. Abrar Ahmed appears more suited to Test cricket so the responsibility to take two or more wickets in the match is actually on Hassan Khan.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThis is a weird game because both sides found their batting line-ups totally outplayed in previous matches, both being bowled out for fairly low scores. However, their respective bowling attacks would appear to be the weakest sections of their sides on paper. That means, with a response needed from both, it could end up being a surprisingly high scoring match and if that is the case then the Unicorns’ top order should be tipped to out score their opposition most times.",

    "body": "The Texas Super Kings triumphed over MI New York by 15 runs in Major League Cricket Match 12.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 12\n\nTexas Super Kings 176/6 (20 ov)\n\nMI New York 161/7 (20 ov)\n\nTexas Super Kings won by 15 runs.\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nWhat should have been a comfortable victory for the Texas Super Kings (TSK) over MI New York (MINY) turned into a tense finish after a spirited fightback by Rashid Khan and Monank Patel during their Cognizant Major League Cricket 2024 fixture at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday.\n\nChasing 177 for the win, MI New York faced early setbacks courtesy of Marcus Stoinis’ bowling onslaught. They lost three wickets in quick succession, including that of the dangerous Nicholas Pooran (1), inside the powerplay. The situation worsened when skipper Kieron Pollard (5) fell cheaply, leaving MINY at 52/5 in 11.2 overs.\n\nAt this stage, the match appeared firmly in TSK's grasp. However, Rashid Khan (50) walked out to the middle and injected much-needed energy into the innings. His aggressive approach stabilized the innings and brought out the best in Monank Patel (61). The pair found boundaries at regular intervals, turning the tide on TSK.\n\nThe duo held on to a 97-run stand for the 6th wicket, giving MINY a glimmer of hope. However, Dwayne Bravo's experience came to the fore. In the crucial 19th over, he conceded just 8 runs, which effectively sealed the game for the Texas Super Kings. Despite the late scare, TSK managed to hold their nerve and secure a 15-run win.\n\nEarlier in the day, Faf du Plessis took full advantage of the powerplay, smashing the MI New York bowlers across the field. His aggressive approach paid off with a quickfire fifty, setting a strong foundation for the Super Kings as they ended up scoring 176/6.\n\nThe breakthrough for MI New York came in the 9th over when left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was introduced into the attack. Despite being expensive, Kenjige managed to dismiss du Plessis, who was caught at long-on by Tim David while attempting another big hit, having scored 61 in 38 balls.\n\nNew Zealand’s Devon Conway provided valuable support with a handy knock before Faf’s dismissal, but he fell short of his fifty, getting dismissed for 40 by Ehsan Adil in the 14th over. The Super Kings then faced a mini-collapse, losing key wickets. Then, Marcus Stoinis stepped up towards the end with some lusty blows, propelling the Super Kings past the 175-run mark.\n\nIn the bowling department, MI New York had their moments. Rashid Khan was the standout performer, maintaining an economical spell with figures on 1/17. Trent Boult also claimed a couple of wickets but was quite expensive on the day.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-85 (Faf du Plessis - 8.5 ov), 2-121 (Devon Conway - 13.1 ov), 3-127 (Aaron Hardie - 14.1 ov), 4-138 (Joshua Tromp - 16.1 ov), 5-143 (Milind Kumar - 16.5 ov), 6-160 (Calvin Savage - 18.1 ov)\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-14 (Ruben Clinton - 1.5 ov), 2-17 (Nicholas Pooran - 2.6 ov), 3-27 (Steven Taylor - 3.5 ov), 4-39 (Kieron Pollard - 8.4 ov), 5-52 (Tim David - 11.2 ov), 6-149 (Rashid Khan - 19.2 ov), 7-157 (Monank Patel - 19.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nNaveen ul Haq\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nMI New York\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nMonank Patel\n\nTim David\n\nSteven Taylor\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nRashid Khan\n\nRuben Clinton\n\nTrent Boult\n\nKagiso Rabada\n\nEhsan Adil\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Monday, July 15, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: MI New York elected to bowl",

In the second innings, a hard-hitting knock from Travis Head (54) and a composed innings from Steven Smith (42*), helped the Washington Freedom romp home with four overs to spare.\n\nThe Washington Freedom dominated the run chase from the outset. Openers Travis Head and Steven Smith ensured an explosive powerplay, with Head clearing the ropes effortlessly. By the end of six overs, Washington Freedom were well ahead at 61/0. While Steven Smith batted cautiously, Travis Head reached his half-century in just 27 balls, including six maximums. However, Shadley Van Schalkwyk broke the 79-run partnership by dismissing Head in the ninth over.\n\nRachin Ravindra (11) then joined Steven Smith, who began to accelerate, adding 29 runs together. However, the pace and bounce of Spencer Johnson deceived Ravindra in the 13th over, leaving the score at 109/2. Andries Gous (15) and Steven Smith comfortably saw the team through the remainder of the innings, finishing at 130/2 in just 16 overs.\n\nEarlier in the day, the LA Knight Riders’ innings began disastrously, as they found themselves at 39/4 during a tempestuous powerplay. Saurabh Netravalkar struck early, removing Sunil Narine (0) and Unmukt Chand (1) in the second over. The collapse continued with Shakib Al Hasan (0) bowled by Glenn Maxwell and Jason Roy (12) dismissed by Lockie Ferguson.\n\nAttempting to stabilize the innings, Nitish Kumar(11) and Saif Badar (35) forged a 44-run partnership. Badar counter-attacked, taking 17 runs off Netravalkar in one over, including two consecutive sixes, during his 35-run knock. However, both batsmen fell in quick succession—Badar to Ravindra and Kumar to Maxwell.\n\nAndre Russell looked dangerous, smashing 20 runs off just 12 deliveries before Maxwell claimed him as his third wicket of the day. The very next over saw Lockie Ferguson dismiss David Miller (1), leaving the Los Angeles Knight Riders struggling at 89/8 in 13.1 overs.\n\nThe tail-enders fought valiantly to push the score to a competitive total. Shadley van Schalkwyk remained unbeaten on 12*, while Spencer Johnson (16) and Ali Khan (11) added crucial runs before Netravalkar returned to wrap up the innings with two more wickets.

Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nSteven Smith the skipper of Washington Freedom says they have been looking for a complete show and this was close to it. Adds they bowled well, and fielded well and it was a dominant chase. Says it was his gut feeling due to which he made the bowling changes, informs Maxwell wasn’t going to bowl but they went with it and he did well. Says they wanted to be positive with the bat and that happened. Adds Head takes the pressure off and he’s batted really well again.\n\nSunil Narine the skipper of Los Angeles Knight Riders says he can’t complain about the toss. Mentions they needed early wickets and did not get it. Adds they need to back their players and he feels his players are still up for it. Ends by saying they were thinking about wickets but that was not the case and now they need to do well in the next games.\n\nGlenn Maxwell is the Player of the Match. He says he’s pleased with his effort. He’s happy to keep the runs down and get the wickets. Adds he’s happy with how the team has played so far.

Adds it was good to spend some time in the middle and he is happy to play the way he did. Mentions it was good to get a few out of the middle and he's pleased with how he batted. Ends by saying he's looking forward to the next games.\n\nEarlier in the game, it was a poor batting performance from the Los Angeles Knight Riders, with only Badar showing resilience while other batters failed to stay at the crease. The team's aggressive approach backfired on a challenging wicket, resulting in soft dismissals and a low total of 129. Netravalkar and the spinners bowled well to keep the pressure on Los Angeles Knight Riders throughout the innings.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders just did not have enough on the board! They created a few chances but it just did not go their way. They though will be disappointed for the speed at which they let their opposition score the runs. They were completely outplayed by much better side on the day.\n\nA thumping win then for Washington Freedom and they remain unbeaten. 130 was never going to be a challenge for them. Yes, they had a bit of luck at the start but their openers provided them the perfect opening. Head and Ravindra fell quickly but Smith and Andries Gous ensured there were no more wickets to fall and took their side over the line.\n\n4\n\nOvers15.4\n\nScore129 - 2\n\nShakib Al Hasan to Andries Gous, FOUR!

Faf du Plessis-led side has won two games, lost one and one of their games was abandoned.\n\nChasing a target of 177, MI New York faced early setbacks due to Marcus Stoinis' devastating bowling spell. They lost three crucial wickets in quick succession, including that of the dangerous Nicholas Pooran (1), all within the powerplay. The situation worsened when skipper Kieron Pollard (5) fell cheaply, leaving MINY reeling at 52/5 in 11.2 overs.\n\nAt this stage, the match appeared firmly in TSK's grasp. However, Rashid Khan (50) stepped onto the field and injected much-needed energy into the innings. His aggressive approach stabilized the innings and brought out the best in Monank Patel (61). The pair found boundaries at regular intervals, turning the tide against TSK.\n\nThe duo held on for a 97-run stand for the 6th wicket, giving MINY a glimmer of hope. However, Dwayne Bravo's experience came to the fore in the crucial 19th over, where he conceded just 8 runs, effectively sealing the game for the Texas Super Kings. Despite the late scare, TSK held their nerve and secured a 15-run win.\n\nEarlier in the day, Faf du Plessis capitalized on the powerplay, smashing the MI New York bowlers across the field. His aggressive approach paid off with a quickfire fifty, setting a strong foundation for the Super Kings, scoring 176/6.\n\nThe breakthrough for MI New York came in the 9th over when left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was introduced into the attack. Despite being expensive, Kenjige managed to dismiss du Plessis, who was caught at long-on by Tim David while attempting another big hit, having scored 61 in 38 balls.\n\nNew Zealand's Devon Conway provided valuable support with a handy knock before Faf's dismissal, but he fell short of his fifty, getting dismissed for 40 by Ehsan Adil in the 14th over. The Super Kings then faced a mini-collapse, losing key wickets, but Marcus Stoinis stepped up towards the end with some powerful shots, propelling the Super Kings past the 175-run mark.\n\nIn the bowling department, MI New York had their moments. Rashid Khan was the standout performer, maintaining an economical spell with figures of 1/17. Trent Boult also claimed a couple of wickets but was quite expensive on the day.",

The 31-year-old speedster is no stranger to American soil, having recently participated in the T20 World Cup held in the USA and West Indies.\n\nCummins' commitment to the San Francisco Unicorns is substantial, with a four-year deal in place. This move is particularly noteworthy as Cummins has limited experience in overseas T20 leagues, having only played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) previously. The right-arm pacer picked 18 wickets in 16 games at an average of 31.44 and an economy of 9.27 in this edition of the cash-rich league.\n\nHis last appearance in Australia's domestic T20 competition, the Big Bash League, dates back to the 2018-19 season, primarily due to his international commitments.\n\nThe timing of Cummins' arrival couldn't be better for the Unicorns, who have struggled this season with only one victory in three matches. The pacer's recent form has been exceptional, including his historic back-to-back hat-tricks in the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nAlso read: How Pat Cummins’ love for technology lured him to Major League Cricket\n\nHis leadership skills were also on display when he guided Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL final. With an impressive T20 record of 172 wickets in 151 matches at an average of 26.66 and an economy rate of 8.11, Cummins is expected to significantly bolster the Unicorns' bowling arsenal.\n\nThe Australian skipper's addition to the team also witnesses the departure of West Indies all-rounder Sherfane Rutherford, who is unable to continue in the MLC due to a family bereavement. This personnel change is likely to alter the team's dynamics and strategy in the upcoming matches.\n\nOther teams also have made changes in their squad, with Ottneil Baartman replacing Gerald Coetzee (injury) at Texas Super Kings and Lungi Ngidi coming in for Wayne Parnell (player withdrawal) at Seattle Orcas.",

His aggressive approach paid off with a quickfire fifty, setting a strong foundation for the Super Kings as they ended up scoring 176/6.\n\nThe breakthrough for MI New York came in the 9th over when left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was introduced into the attack. Despite being expensive, Kenjige managed to dismiss du Plessis, who was caught at long-on by Tim David while attempting another big hit, having scored 61 in 38 balls.\n\nNew Zealand’s Devon Conway provided valuable support with a handy knock before Faf’s dismissal, but he fell short of his fifty, getting dismissed for 40 by Ehsan Adil in the 14th over. The Super Kings then faced a mini-collapse, losing key wickets. Then, Marcus Stoinis stepped up towards the end with some lusty blows, propelling the Super Kings past the 175-run mark.\n\nThe breakthrough for MI New York came in the 9th over when left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was introduced into the attack.

    "body": "The Major League Cricket 2024 is going on in the USA, with popular players from different nations joining in the play. The tournament started on 5 July, 2024, the day after USA celebrated its independence and will go on until 28 July. While the season is midway, Australia‘s star cricketer Pat Cummins is set to join San Francisco Unicorns in MLC.\n\nCummins signed a four-year deal with the franchise. The 31-year-old has mainly played in the IPL among overseas T20 leagues and has been absent from Australia’s Big Bash League since the 2018–19 season due to his international commitments.\n\nCummins joins the San Francisco Unicorns midway during the MLC\n\nPat Cummins is set to return to the USA for the MLC 2024. Cummins played the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 in the USA and West Indies for Australia. Cummins’ arrival comes as Sherfane Rutherford departs. The hard-hitting West Indies allrounder, who has not participated in any of the Unicorns’ matches this season, will miss the rest of the Major League Cricket (MLC) due to a bereavement in his family.\n\nThis change marks a significant shift for the team, which hopes Cummins will fill the gap left by Rutherford’s absence.\n\nOther teams in the MLC are also experiencing roster changes. Ottneil Baartman will replace Gerald Coetzee in the Texas Super Kings. Gerald is sidelined due to an injury.\n\nBaartman’s inclusion is to bolster the team’s bowling attack as they navigate through the remainder of the season. Coetzee’s injury has been a setback, but the team is optimistic about Baartman’s potential contributions.\n\nSimilarly, the Seattle Orcas have made a key substitution, with Lungi Ngidi taking over from Wayne Parnell, who withdrew from the tournament.\n\nNgidi’s addition is a strategic move to strengthen the Orcas’ lineup. Parnell’s withdrawal required a swift response, and the team believes Ngidi’s experience and skills will be crucial in maintaining their competitive edge as they advance in the MLC.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns look for a fate change\n\nPat Cummins’ arrival in the team is expected to mark the comeback for the San Francisco Unicorns. The Unicorns have won just one of their three games this year, and they will benefit greatly from the addition of Cummins.\n\nKnown for his impressive performances, Cummins made history by securing back-to-back hat-tricks at the T20 World Cup. Before that, he led Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL final.\n\nHis experience and skill will help provide a much-needed boost to the team. Sun Risers Hyderabad got to the IPL 2024 finals but lost the season to Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nCummins brings a wealth of experience, having played 151 T20 matches and taken 172 wickets with an average of 26.66 and an economy rate of 8.11.\n\nHis consistent performance in T20 cricket makes him a valuable asset for the Unicorns. The team hopes his presence will enhance their bowling attack and improve their standings as the season progresses.",

Opting to bowl first on a slow pitch, Freedom’s bowlers capitalized on the conditions, restricting Knight Riders to a modest total of 129.\n\nThe decision to bowl first proved to be a masterstroke, as the pitch offered just enough assistance to keep the Knight Riders batters in check, leading to a comfortable chase for Freedom.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar’s bowling masterclass\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar, who had been a standout performer in the recent T20 World Cup, showcased his prowess with a phenomenal spell, returning figures of 4/35. He struck twice in his opening over, removing Sunil Narine with a perfect full length delivery that knocked over his stumps and Unmukt Chand with a short pitched ball.\n\nBy the fifth over, Knight Riders were reeling at 18/4, with Jason Roy and Shakib Al Hasan also back in the pavilion. Roy was caught at deep midwicket trying to clear the boundary, while Shakib was bowled through the gate by a beautifully disguised slower ball. Saif Badar attempted to stabilize the innings with a cautious 35, playing some elegant shots and rotating the strike effectively. However, his dismissal – trapped LBW by a skidding delivery from Rachin Ravindra – triggered another collapse.\n\nAlso READ: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024: Complete squads of all six teams\n\nSteve Smith’s remarkable catch off Glenn Maxwell’s bowling\n\nGlenn Maxwell then tightened the screws with his accurate off-spin, finishing with figures of 3/15. His spell included the crucial wicket of Andre Russell, who looked dangerous during his brief stay at the crease. Russell, trying to accelerate the scoring, was caught at long-on, failing to clear the boundary. And then, Steve Smith‘s exceptional fielding claimed the wicket of Nitish Kumar.\n\nOn the third ball of the eleventh over, Maxwell bowled a delivery pitched on a length at middle stump. Nitish attempted to clear the ropes but failed to achieve the desired elevation. The ball went towards short mid-wicket, where Smith timed his jump perfectly and took a stunning airborne catch.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nPowerful batting seals the win for Washington Freedom\n\nAfter that Lockie Ferguson added to the pressure with his express pace, taking two wickets in quick succession, ensuring that LAKR folded with eight balls left in their innings.\n\nIn the chase, Travis Head and captain Smith provided a solid start, amassing 61 runs in the powerplay. Head was particularly aggressive, scoring 40 off just 23 balls, smashing six sixes in his 32-ball 54. Despite his dismissal, which led to a slight dip in the scoring rate, Smith anchored the innings with an unbeaten 42. His composed knock ensured that Freedom chased down the target comfortably, with eight wickets and four overs to spare, maintaining their perfect start to the season.",

Steve Smith had not played a competitive game since the Christchurch Test against New Zealand in March. He did not play in the IPL as he was not picked up by any franchise in the auction but he did ply his trade as a commentator. The right-handed batsman was also not a part of Australia's squad for the T20 World Cup last month.\n\nHe finally returned to action earlier this month in the ongoing MLC 2024. The former Australia skipper has looked in good touch with the bat so far. And on Sunday (July 14), he once again showed that he is still one of the sharpest fielders in the game as he pulled off a stunning catch during the game between Washington Freedom and Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nOn the second ball of the 11th over, Glenn Maxwell bowled a flighted delivery on the pads to Nitish Kumar and the Knight Riders batter decided to hit the ball through the mid-wicket area. However, the USA batter failed to keep his shot down and paid a price for it as Steve Smith came up with a brilliant effort to catch the ball and send him back.\n\nWatch the catch from Steve Smith:\n\nTalking about the game, Washington Freedom thrashed the Knight Riders by 8 wickets. Asked to bat first, the Knight Riders were bowled out for just 129 runs. At one stage, they were reeling at 89 for 8 before the lower-order players guided them to a respectable total.",

    "date": "",
    "body": "During the Major League Cricket match between the Los Angeles Knight Riders and Washington Freedom at Church Street Park in Morrisville on Sunday, Andre Russell delivered a powerful ball that struck Travis Head’s bat with such force it broke the bat in two. Despite this, Head showed incredible resilience, continuing his impressive performance to score 54 runs off just 32 balls, hitting 2 fours and 6 sixes.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders, having been sent in to bat by Washington Freedom’s captain Steve Smith, managed to score only 129 runs in 18.4 overs. This was largely due to superb bowling by Saurabh Netravalkar, who took 4 wickets for 35 runs, and Glenn Maxwell, who took 3 wickets for 15 runs.\n\nWhile chasing the target of 130 runs, Washington Freedom’s openers Head and Smith provided a strong start with a partnership of 79 runs, making the run-chase easy. However, in the second over of their innings, Russell bowled a fast, short-pitched delivery that broke Head’s bat into two pieces as he attempted a pull shot. The ball hit the upper part of the bat, leaving Head with just the handle while the rest of the bat flew towards mid-wicket.\n\nThis unexpected incident left Head visibly surprised, and his reaction went viral on social media. Nonetheless, Head went on to score 54 runs off 32 balls, helping Washington Freedom secure a magnificent eight-wicket win.\n\nAfter the match, Head commented, “The pitch was on the slower side and took more spin than previous games. It was nice to get a few good shots and secure a win. It felt great to play the entire match and get some luck. The crowd’s energy was amazing, and it helped us maximize our performance when Smithy and I were batting. I’m looking forward to the rest of the tournament.”",

Fixtures\n\nMajor League Cricket Teams\n\nReady to dive into the action with the best Major League Cricket betting sites? Here, we give the lowdown on all the MLC 2024 teams, including their strengths and weaknesses, to enable you to place more informed bets on the tournament. Importantly, to stay abreast of the latest news and team updates, check out this space on ESPNcricinfo.\n\n1. MI New York\n\nCaptain: Kieron Pollard\n\nOverseas players: Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran and Romario Shepherd (West Indies), Kagiso Rabada, Dewald Brevis and Anrich Nortje (South Africa), Tim David (Australia), Rashid Khan (Afghanistan), Trent Boult (New Zealand)\n\n2023 Standing: Champion\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Nicholas Pooran (388)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Trent Boult (22)\n\nKey players: Nicholas Pooran, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan\n\nTeam analysis: The defending champions have the most balanced squad on paper, which consists of several hard hitters, quality pacers, and a spin wizard in Rashid Khan. They have retained most of their core squad from last season and have also roped in USA national team captain Monank Patel. They are the frontrunners to retain the trophy for the second successive season.\n\n2. Los Angeles Knight Riders\n\nCaptain: Sunil Narine\n\nOverseas players: Spencer Johnson and Alex Carry (Australia), Jason Roy (England), Sunil Narine and Andre Russell (West Indies), Shakib Al Hasan (Bangladesh), Waqar Salamkheil (Afghanistan), Joshua Little (Ireland), David Miller (South Africa)\n\n2023 Standing: Last\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Andre Russell (206)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Adam Zampa (9)\n\nKey players: Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Ali Khan\n\nTeam analysis: They had a disappointing season last year, finishing at the bottom of the table and winning only one match. This year, however, they have made some good signings. Most of their overseas players are in great form, with many of them winning T20 leagues around the world. With a perfect combination of aggressive batters, all-rounders, and domestic talent, they have a great chance of turning things around and becoming the Major League Cricket champions in 2024.\n\n3. Washington Freedom\n\nCaptain: Steve Smith\n\nOverseas players: Marco Jansen (South Africa), Lockie Ferguson and Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand), Akeal Hosein (West Indies),\n\nSteve Smith, Jack Edwards, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Andrew Tye (Australia)\n\n2023 Standing: 3rd\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Matthew Short (152)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Saurabh Netravalkar (10)\n\nKey players: Saurabh Netravalkar, Akeal Hosein, Travis Head\n\nTeam analysis: Washington Freedom came in third last season, losing to MI New York in the eliminator. In a total revamp, they have filled their squad with bona fide T20 stars, including as many as five Australians who can destroy any opponent on a given day. With the induction of Lockie Ferguson, Andrew Tye, and Akeal Hosein, they have also bolstered their bowling lineup. Importantly, they also have an excellent domestic crop of players.\n\n4. San Francisco Unicorns\n\nCaptain: Corey Anderson\n\nOverseas players: Finn Allen and Matt Henry (New Zealand), Haris Rauf and Abrar Ahmed (Pakistan), Sherfane Rutherford (West Indies), Matthew Short, Josh Inglis, Pat Cummins and Jake Fraser-McGurk (Australia)\n\n2023 Standing: 5th\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Corey Anderson (190)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Liam Plunkett (7)\n\nKey players: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Sherfane Rutherford, Pat Cummins\n\nTeam analysis: Having finished fifth last season, the San Francisco Unicorns have made some sweeping changes to their overseas roster. They have got all their bases covered this season, signing aggressive openers, excellent middle-order batters, and T20 specialist pacers in their ranks. However, when it comes to their domestic recruits, the team does look slightly weak on paper.\n\n5. Texas Super Kings\n\nCaptain: Faf du Plessis\n\nOverseas players: Faf du Plessis and Aiden Markram (South Africa), Dwayne Bravo (West Indies), Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner (New Zealand), Noor Ahmad and Naveen ul Haq (Afghanistan), Marcus Stoinis (Australia), Matheesha Pathirana (Sri Lanka)\n\n2023 Standing: 2nd\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Devon Conway (221)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Mohammad Mohsin (9)\n\nKey players: Mohammad Mohsin, Marcus Stoinis, Faf du Plessis\n\nTeam analysis: A star-studded side with quality players, the Texas Super Kings came in second in the group stage last year, eventually losing to MI New York in the challenger. They have an excellent bowling lineup; however, they seem to have missed the bus when it comes to choosing their batsmen. With Devon Conway an uncertain starter due to his injury, they hardly have any T20 specialist batters this time around.\n\n6. Seattle Orcas\n\nCaptain: Wayne Parnell\n\nOverseas players: Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, Wayne Parnell, Nandre Burger and Ryan Rickelton (South Africa), Zaman Khan and Imad Wasim (Pakistan), Obed McCoy (West Indies), Michael Bracewell (New Zealand)\n\n2023 Standing: Runner-up\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Quinton de Kock (264)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Cameron Gannon (11)\n\nKey players: Heinrich Klaasen, Cameron Gannon, Imad Wasim\n\nTeam analysis: The 2023 Major League Cricket runner-up, the Seattle Orcas had to let go of many overseas players this time. Yes, they have a good bowling department, but their batters, barring Heinrich Klaasen, are either not in form or at the tail end of their careers. Everything considered, we do not expect the Orcas to reach the playoffs.\n\nMajor League Cricket (2024): Overview\n\nThe 2024 MLC (also called the Cognizant Major League Cricket for sponsorship reasons) is only the second edition of this franchise T20 cricket league, and will be held from (IST) July 6 – 29, 2024.\n\nThe league was established by the American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in the United States in 2019. The first season of the competition was played in 2023.\n\nMuch like the previous season, the 2024 chapter of the Major League Cricket will be hosted across two venues: Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas (Texas) and Church Street Park in Morrisville (North Carolina).\n\nIn May 2024, MLC announced it had obtained a List A status (one of the three major forms of the sport recognised by the ICC) for all the fixtures in the tournament.\n\nA total of six teams will participate in the competition: Los Angeles Knight Riders (captained by Sunil Narine), MI New York (Kieron Pollard), San Francisco Unicorns (Pat Cummins), Seattle Orcas (Wayne Parnell), Texas Super Kings (Faf du Plessis), and Washington Freedom (captain TBD).\n\nThe tournament will follow this structure: a total of 21 round-robin matches, followed by the playoffs.\n\nThere will be three playoff matches: eliminator (3rd vs 4th), followed by a qualifier (1st vs 2nd, the team that wins qualifies for the final), and finally the challenger (the loser of the qualifier meets the winner of the eliminator, with the winner going to the final).\n\nThe final will be played on July 29 (IST).\n\nEach team can choose a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 19 players in its squad, including a maximum of nine overseas players.\n\nMI New York are the defending champions, having won the inaugural MLC season in 2023.\n\nNicholas Pooran (388) and Trent Boult (22) are the tournament's top run-getter and wicket-taker, respectively. Both play for MI New York.\n\nHow To Bet on The Major League Cricket\n\nStep 1: Choose your preferred MLC betting site from the bookmakers we've recommended here.\n\nStep 2: Click on ‘Sign Up’ or ‘Register’.\n\nStep 3: Fill in your personal details, set a username and password, and click on ‘Submit'.\n\nStep 4: Your betting account is now ready.\n\nStep 5: Now, log in and don’t forget to claim your sports welcome bonus.\n\nStep 6: Choose ‘Cricket' from the sportsbook and then select the Major League Cricket match you wish to bet on.\n\nStep 7: Choose a suitable betting market for that game, look for the best odds, and place your wager.\n\nMajor League Cricket: Best Live Betting Sites\n\n1. Melbet\n\nWith multiple live betting markets available for every game, Melbet is widely preferred for live betting on the Major League Cricket. The intuitive interface adds to the convenience; the cash-out option gives you control over your bets; and the high-quality livestreaming feature has a multi-view option that lets you stream several matches simultaneously.\n\nThat said, the absence of a quick-bet feature is a bit of a letdown.\n\n2. 10CRIC\n\nThe bookmaker arguably offers the most competitive odds for pre-match wagers across tournaments, but is equally adept if you wish to place live bets. The 10CRIC sportsbook is tailored to cricket betting and Indians, with competitive in-play odds, an excellent live betting interface that neither lags nor takes time to update, and a mix of several in-play markets to choose from. The cash-out option comes in handy as well.\n\nRegrettably, the bookmaker does not offer livestreaming as of the day of writing. That said, you find detailed match statistics and a seamless ball-by-ball live simulation, both of which are helpful in their own right.\n\n3. Parimatch\n\nThe Parimatch live betting interface is definitely better than decent. You can watch live action, make quick analyses of events, and place your bets on the game while it's still unfolding in the middle. The live betting odds also update promptly and without any interruption, contributing positively to the overall experience.\n\nHowever, much like 10CRIC, Parimatch does not have a livestreaming option at this time. But the platform somewhat makes up for it by providing exhaustive match statistics and a ball-by-ball live simulation.\n\nMajor League Cricket: Popular Betting Markets\n\nMatch Winner: Predict the winner of any MLC game.\n\nTop Team Batsman: Predict who you think will be the top runscorer for his team in any match.\n\nTop Team Bowler: Predict who you think will be the top wicket-taker for his team in any match.\n\nPlayer of the Match: Predict who you think will be the Man of the Match in a particular game.\n\n1st Dismissal Method: Bet on the way the first batsman in an innings will be dismissed.\n\nFirst Ball of the Match: Bet on the outcome of the first ball of the game.\n\nTo Score 50+ Runs: ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ if you think any batsman will score a half century or more in a game.\n\nTo Score 100 Runs: ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ if you think any batsman will score a century in a game.\n\nMost Boundaries: Bet on the team or player who will hit the most boundaries in a game.\n\nMost Sixes: Bet on the team or player who will hit the most sixes in a game.\n\nMajor League Cricket 2024 Schedule\n\nBelow is the full Major League Cricket schedule for 2024.

    "title": "Watch: Pat Cummins Smashed For Six Off First Ball In Major League Cricket",
    "date": "Tue Jul 16 09:57:00 2024",
    "body": "Earlier this year, the World Cup-winning Australia captain confirmed that he had signed a deal to play in the second season of Major League Cricket in the USA, with the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nCummins missed the side's first three matches as he took an extended rest following the 2024 T20 World Cup, which saw Australia fail to make the semifinals. He arrived in time to make his MLC debut in the Unicorns' fourth match of the campaign, against Seattle Orcas.\n\nSan Francisco batted first and scored 165-7. Matthew Short top-scored with a solid 56, and quickfire contributions came from Finn Allen (34) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (30). Cummins batted at No.8, and remained not out on six.\n\nIn the run chase, Seattle had made a sedate start, getting to 22-0 in 4 overs. Cummins came on to bowl the fifth over, and started with a fullish off-cutter on leg-stump. Left-hander Ryan Rickleton duly obliged the loosener, swinging through the line and sending the ball over long-on to welcome Cummins.\n\nThe over ended up going for 14 runs.

    "body": "Right then, this is it from Match number 13 where the momentum shifted back and forth in favor of both sides, but eventually, it was the San Francisco Unicorns who held their nerves and emerged victorious. Up next in the Major League Cricket, 2024 is another exciting clash in Match number 14. It will be MI New York going tooth and nail against Washington Freedom at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas. That game will be played on July 17th, Wednesday and the first ball will be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT). Till then take care, and cheers!\n\nCorey Anderson, the victorious skipper of San Francisco Unicorns says that it was a good outing overall. Says that the new ball came on nicely but mentions that when it slowed down, it got tough to play the strokes. Appreciates Sanjay Krishnamurthi and says that he is a young lad and he played a good crucial cameo. On Pat Cummins, he says that Cummins is a world class player and just to have him in the group is a huge luxury. Adds they will plan how to plan the next game at Dallas and would look to get on a roll now.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, the captain of Seattle Orcas says that they didn't bat well once again and lost key players at the back end. Says they need to close games out responsibly. Says the bowlers have been fantastic but the batters need to step up big time. He says a win here and there can hopefully flip things for them.\n\nLiam Plunkett wins the PLAYER OF THE MATCH Award for his brilliant bowling figures (4-0-26-3). He says that the way the Seattle Orcas batted inside the powerplay, it looked like going one way but after the break, they came back strongly. Adds it got more and more tough to get along as the ball got older. Ends up saying it was all about trying to execute their plans and maximizing that phase.\n\nMatthew Short is in for a chat. He says that it felt nice to bat there. Adds that he feels good about batting in the first six overs. Mentions that Ryan Rickelton and Quinton de Kock were in form but the wicket was in his favour. Says that Rickelton was in fine form but thinks the wicket was spinning and was a bit skiddy as well. Adds they have been a bit unlucky with the rain. Says in a short tournament like this, every game is critical. Says that they are looking forward to their following games and will look to win them.\n\nEarlier in the game, the Unicorns were asked to bat first and had a bit of a rocky start. JFM was gone in a flash, but then Matthew Short and Finn Allen teamed up for a fireworks display, smashing 75 runs together and sending the score rocketing. But the game twisted as both fell in quick succession and suddenly the boundaries dried up. Cameron Gannon and Imad Wasim spotted their chance and pounced. While their teammates were getting a bit of a hammering. They snagged three wickets each, tightening the screws on the Unicorns' innings. Just when it looked like the Unicorns might fizzle out, Krishnamurthy charged in for some last-minute heroics. His late blitz helped push the total to a respectable 165, which realistically made the difference in the end.\n\nOn the flip side, the Unicorns must have felt that they were short of 10-15 runs. They needed a wicket desperately but couldn't get any breakthrough inside the restrictions. As many as six bowlers were used in the powerplay but they couldn't find that scalp. But the tide turned dramatically when Plunkett finally cracked the code, grabbing the first wicket. Short quickly followed suit, and then Cummins, despite leaking runs, struck gold by dismissing the well-set Jayasuriya. This trio of wickets swung the momentum, with the Unicorns cleverly using slower deliveries to keep the Orcas off-balance. The bowlers then literally ran through the opposition lineup giving away next to nothing and closed up in fine fashion.\n\nHowever, as the innings progressed, the Orcas found themselves lagging behind the asking rate with Jayasuriya too, back in the hut. Just when they needed a steady partnership to ease the mounting pressure, they kept losing quick wickets with all the hitters back in the hut without any impact. The inning that once looked in absolute command suddenly lost its momentum in a jiffy in the mid overs and just couldn't recover from the collapse.\n\nDone and dusted! The San Francisco Unicorns seal the deal winning this clash by 23 runs and climbing to the third spot. A job well done by the Men in Orange and Blue. The Seattle Orcas on the other hand will be gutted with the way things panned out for them towards the second half of the chase. The Seattle Orcas kicked off their chase of 166 with a measured approach. Shehan Jayasuriya and Ryan Rickelton got things rolling nicely, forming a steady opening partnership and pouncing on any loose deliveries. Jayasuriya, in particular, was the aggressor in chief as he was timing the ball to perfection, making it look effortless. Even as wickets tumbled at the other end, Jayasuriya stood firm, notching up a solid resilient half-century.\n\nThe Orcas are heading up for their third defeat of the season here and it would be interesting to see how they recover from this in their latter games. However, this game was really under control in the first half with Jayasuriya going hammer and tonks, but they certainly lost the momentum in the next half.\n\nPat Cummins (3-0-30-1) is back into the attack to bowl the last over of his quota. With 33 runs needed off the 11 remaining deliveries, and all the recognised batters into the sheds, the chances of Orcas getting through have zeroed now.\n\nWith Harmeet Singh back in the hut, the tensions further deepen and things have gotten precarious for the Orcas now. They still need 38 off the last 18 remaining deliveries. Cameron Gannon is the next batter in at number 8. Haris Rauf (2-0-23-0) is back into the attack.\n\nW\n\nOvers16.6\n\nScore128 - 6\n\nLiam Plunkett to Harmeet Singh, OUT! TAKEN! Matthew Short with an excellent running catch at deep mid-wicket. Short, on middle, Singh pulls it from closer to the body and hence, he fails to generate the requisite power and the distance as gets the timing completely wrong. It carries towards deep mid-wicket where Matthew Short takes a sharp catch running to his left.\n\n4\n\nOvers16.5\n\nScore128 - 5\n\nLiam Plunkett to Harmeet Singh, FOUR! Edgy but they will take it! Short, on off, Singh looks to pull it but gets a top edge as the ball flies over short fine for a boundary.\n\nStrategic Break! This has been a fabulous comeback from the San Francisco Unicorns with the ball. What looked like a lopsided affair at the beginning of the chase, has turned out to be a nail biting one. With all the big hitters back in the hut, Orcas are still in the hunt of 53 off the last 30 remaining deliveries. Every bowler from the Unicorns has struck timely scalps and helped their team sneak back into the contest. Will Corey Anderson and Co manage to squeeze their opposition further, or will Harmeet Singh play a heroic here? Let's find out together. Corey Anderson (2.2-0-13-1) to continue after the break.\n\n1\n\nOvers14.5\n\nScore110 - 5\n\nPat Cummins to Harmeet Singh, On a length and on off, Singh looks to flick it but gets a leading edge as the ball carries and lands safely at mid on. They cross.\n\n4\n\nOvers14.3\n\nScore109 - 5\n\nPat Cummins to Harmeet Singh, FOUR! They need more of these! Touch short and on off, Harmeet Singh looks to pull it but gets a top edge as the ball goes over the keeper's head for a boundary.",
    "summary": "Match 13: San Francisco Unicorns won against Seattle Orcas by 23 runs. The Unicorns batted first and set a target of 166, which the Orcas failed to chase down. Liam Plunkett was awarded Player of the Match for his excellent bowling figures of 4-0-26-3.\n\nIn the match, the Unicorns had a rocky start but recovered thanks to a partnership between Matthew Short and Finn Allen. Sanjay Krishnamurthi's late cameo helped push the total to 165. The Orcas struggled to chase down the target, losing wickets regularly, and eventually fell short.\n\nThe Unicorns' captain, Corey Anderson, praised his team's performance and credited Liam Plunkett and Pat Cummins for their crucial contributions. On the other hand, Seattle Orcas' captain, Heinrich Klaasen, lamented his team's batting woes and hoped for a turnaround in their next games.\n\nNext up is Match 14 between MI New York and Washington Freedom at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, scheduled for July 17th, at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT).",

Their timely boundaries and steady play helped Washington cross the 100-run mark in the 11th over.\n\nHowever, Head's blistering knock of 54 off 33 balls, featuring nine fours and two sixes, came to an end in the next over when he was caught by Rashid Khan at long-on off Romario Shepherd. Glen Maxwell soon followed Head back to the pavilion, despite being given a lifeline in the 15th over when Taylor dropped him at mid-off. Rashid Khan eventually dismissed Maxwell in the 16th over, with him managing to score 15 off 14 balls. After 16 overs, Washington stood at 133/3, with Andries Gous still in the middle.\n\nWashington finished their innings strongly, as they scored 49 runs in the last four overs, thanks to the free-flowing strokes of Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra.

However, Rashid's timely strike brought a sigh of relief to the MI camp as he castled Maxwell.\n\nFrom over the wicket, Rashid bowled a well-disguised googly, which Maxwell failed to read.

It is a recurrence of what transpired following his exclusion from the Ashes trip in the 2022–2023 season.\n\nThe pacer had earlier sustained a side strain in his second ODI match, which curtailed his summer.

He last played for Australia against Sri Lanka in mid-2022.\n\n\"Jhye is in a similar boat. He's fit and firing now, and again looking for match opportunities. I think he'll get opportunities again across the summer. For both [him and Morris] I think it's getting through the season fit and then hopefully maximising the amount of cricket they play. Some of that will be domestic, hopefully, there will be some international opportunities [and] Australia A opportunities, then I think we set them up for success in the long term,\" he said.\n\nAustralia's national selector added that the dominance of the pace trio of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Josh Hazlewood with Scott Boland making inroads with some stunning performances in Test cricket.\n\n\"Jhye is in a similar boat.

Washington Freedom's victory makes them the first team to qualify for the Playoffs of the second season, consolidating their lead at the top of the points table with nine points from five matches.\n\nMI New York faced a disastrous start in their run chase as Washington Freedom bowlers wreaked havoc.

However, Smith was dismissed by Rashid Khan in the fifth over, scoring 8 off 10. Head then took charge, forming a solid partnership with Andries Gous. Their timely boundaries and steady play helped Washington cross the 100-run mark in the 11th over. Head's blistering knock ended in the 12th over when he was caught by Rashid Khan off Romario Shepherd, having scored 54 off 33 balls. Glen Maxwell soon followed, despite being given a lifeline in the 15th over when Taylor dropped him at mid-off. Rashid Khan eventually dismissed him in the 16th over, with Maxwell managing to score 15 off 14 balls. After 16 overs, Washington stood at 133/3, with Gous still anchoring the innings.\n\nWashington finished their innings strongly, adding 49 runs in the last four overs, thanks to the free-flowing strokes of Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra. Gous reached his half-century in the 19th over, while Ravindra smashed two sixes and a four off Boult, producing 23 runs in the same over. Ravindra was dismissed by Kieron Pollard in the final over after a quickfire 31 off 14 balls.

    "title": "Rewriting Cricket’s Narrative: How Major League Cricket is Transforming the Sport in the United States",
    "date": "Tue Jul 16 12:26:42 2024",
    "body": "In the United States, there have always been four primary sports that ruled over all others — football, baseball (obviously), basketball, and hockey. That said, another new competition is just beginning to flex its muscles and gain respect from fans across the country — Major League Cricket (MLC). MLC T20 cricket league launched in 2022 to bring Cricket on similar lines to major sports leagues in the USA.\n\nMeaning of MLC for Cricket in the United States\n\nCricket is no new entrant to the U.S. sporting landscape; it is undoubtedly a niche sport upheld as an elitist and unattainable spectator sport compared to the other major leagues. However, the rise of MLC may well see that story shift. The league has started to promote Cricket at a scientific level, hack new audiences, and enrich the local role of American Cricket on the professional stage.\n\nMLC plans to tap into a broad audience and introduce Cricket in a traditional form by setting up franchise-based teams across important metropolitan centers. The league’s efforts to groom home-grown talent and the arrival of some international stars are likely to help increase young American cricketers decide they want to be part of their nation side, creating new fanbases for the sport around America.\n\nPartnership with Global Environment: Major League Cricket\n\nBeyond the U.S., MLC has more significant ideas. The General Manager of the league has already announced strategic partnerships with established cricket boards and leagues around the globe, including Cricket West Indies, Cricket Australia, and Emirates Cricket Board. These international connections have allowed MLC to bring on the best global players and coaches, as well as technical expertise in new Netball tactics, raising the standard of play.\n\nDepending on how successful MLC is, the impact on the wider game could be huge for Cricket worldwide. While the league has long been a hit in South Africa, its growing appeal stateside could make it a blueprint for Cricket to establish itself in other non-traditional markets and broaden its global reach.\n\nAlso Read: Major League Cricket (MLC): Showcasing the Rise of Cricketing Titans with Grandest Stage\n\nChallenges and Opportunities of MLC\n\nWhile MLC enters with some encouraging noise, several headwinds ensure the league has its work cut out for it in trying to stay stateside long-term. This will involve massive infrastructure spending, from building world-class cricket stadiums to practice facilities and creating audiences around the game.\n\nThe league also has to lure in American sports fans who are used to a quicker pace and higher scores than the kind dished out by so much soccer. The content and depth of the story created by this will ultimately determine MLC’s success, in conjunction with good marketing efforts to commercialize it.\n\nImpact on the USA Economy of Major League Cricket\n\nThe birth of Major League Cricket represents a historic moment for the game of cricket in America and can have an enormous economic impact!!! The league is expected to have a significant economic impact on America as it continues to grow and makes its mark in North America.\n\nThe future operation of these facilities is expected to provide an economic boost in the long run, while their construction will create work in the short term. Furthermore, better availability of quality cricket infrastructure can aid the genesis and flourishing of the sport at grassroots levels by enhancing financial paybacks.\n\nMajor League Cricket has the capacity to transfer this wealth into the American economy by leveraging professional cricket and may transform itself into a national economic powerhouse, creating jobs, revenue generation, and ancillary industry development. As the league develops further and more rapidly, its economic influence is expected to be a key determinant of both sustainability in the long run and success everywhere else.\n\nConclusion\n\nMajor League Cricket will become a turning point in the global proliferation of Cricket; wait. By launching a new professional league here, MLC seeks to change the dynamic of how Cricket is played in this country and lead American cricketers by example while capturing the attention and imagination — and wallets — of sports fans throughout the USA. As the league keeps evolving and expanding, its contribution to future Cricket will be watched by everyone in their homes worldwide.",

MI New York scored 154-9 with US international Saurabh Netravalkar taking 3-24 off his four overs before Steve Smith’s unbeaten 46 from 28 balls saw Freedom home by a slender margin before the rain came.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLWW\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: EXPERIENCED IN ABUNDANCE\n\nThe Texas Super Kings, built with the help of so-called ‘Dad’s Army’ Indian Premier League franchise Chennai Super Kings, began their season with a 12-run loss to last season’s wooden spoon outfit Los Angeles Knight Riders in Dallas with Devon Conway’s 53 runs from 39 deliveries not enough to see TSK reach the target of 163.\n\nLAST THREE: LLLWL\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Washington Freedom have a squad heavily influenced by Australians with aforementioned captain Steve Smith leading the likes of Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell among others. Head missed out with just one run from seven balls against MI New York but that is not expected to be a common occurrence for their Test number five and Head to top score for Freedom is always a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, they have a well-rounded attack, too, with plenty of spin options but also the pace of Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar. Ferguson took 1-28 the other day and his bowling has been difficult to hit for a while now, famously taking 3-0 from four overs for New Zealand against Papua New Guinea last month, so Ferguson to be Freedom’s best bowler in this one would be a good shout.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nAs mentioned, there is experience throughout the TSK side but the downside to that is there is perhaps not bundles of energy and that was shown in their fairly slow chase the other day. If they are to up the tempo then a lot will rest on the shoulders of Aaron Hardie and Marcus Stoinis. Stoinis didn’t have the best of starts with two from six but if he gets going he is a formidable hitter and Stoinis to hit two or more sixes in any innings, especially one where he needs to respond, would be a reasonable expectation.\n\nIn the bowling department, the Super Kings lack a bit of quality experience with Zia-ul-Haq their best bowler from the other day, taking 2-16. Spin is likely to be their biggest threat against the likes of Head and Smith, and even Maxwell, though, so Mohammad Mohsin, despite going wicket-less the other day, would be tipped to take two or more wickets here.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS TEXAS SUPER KINGS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThere are quite a few issues in the Texas Super Kings side and there is probably too much reliance on the opening pair of Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway to score their runs. That means they will likely take their time to get set and TSK having the better opening stand, or at least the biggest with the pace of Head’s innings likely to be a major factor in the game, would be a good bet but Washington Freedom, albeit not overly convincing against MI New York the other day, would still be viewed as favourites for the match.",

Opener Jason Roy contributed a brisk 26 off 18 balls before being bowled by Plunkett. Despite small contributions from Sunil Narine (6), Nitish Kumar (20), and David Miller (24), the team struggled to maintain momentum.\n\nShakib Al Hasan stood out with a solid 35 off 26 balls, but it was Andre Russell's explosive unbeaten 40 off 25 balls that provided a late surge, helping LAKR to a total of 165 for 6 in their 20 overs.\n\nThe Unicorns' bowling attack was led by Brody Couch and Haris Rauf, both claiming two wickets each. Couch finished with impressive figures of 2 for 24, while Rauf took 2 for 38. Their disciplined bowling ensured that LAKR's batsmen could never fully capitalize on their starts.\n\nIn response, the Unicorns got off to a shaky start, losing Jake Fraser-McGurk early for 9 runs. However, New Zealand opener Finn Allen and Matthew Short took control of the chase.\n\nAllen's aggressive 63 off 37 balls and Short's blistering 58 off 26 balls formed a match-winning partnership of 116 runs for the second wicket. Their combined assault left the LAKR bowlers struggling, particularly targeting Spencer Johnson, who despite taking three wickets, conceded 36 runs in his four overs.\n\nVeteran spinner Sunil Narine managed to take a wicket, finishing with 1 for 39, but the rest of the LAKR bowlers failed to make significant inroads. The Unicorns achieved the target comfortably, reaching 166 for 4 in just 15.2 overs, sealing a comprehensive victory.\n\nWith this dominant performance, the San Francisco Unicorns have set a high standard for their season ahead. The LA Knight Riders will need to regroup and strategize better for their upcoming matches to bounce back from this defeat.",

    "body": "San Francisco Unicorns: San Francisco Unicorns registered a comprehensive six-wicket win against LA Knight Riders in the fourth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket.\n\nElecting to bowl first at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, San Francisco Unicorns limited the LA Knight Riders to 165/6, with debutant Broady Couch (2/24) and Harris Rauf (2/38) bagging two wickets each, before blistering half-centuries from Finn Allen (63) and Matthew Short (58) orchestrated a swift run chase for the Unicorns.\n\nAndre Russell’s (40*) late surge proved too little for the LA Knight Riders, whose star batters such as David Miller (24), Shakib Al Hassan (35) and Jason Roy (26) failed to capitalise on their starts.\n\nTrending\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns’ run chase saw opener Jake Fraser Mcgurk (9) fall early, caught behind on Spencer Johnson’s bowling. However, Finn Allen looked eager to make a quick meal of the target. The right-handed opener smashed Russell for two consecutive sixes in the fifth over, followed by three consecutive sixes of Shakib Al Hassan in the next over, to complete five maximums in just as many deliveries. At the end of the powerplay the Unicorns were firmly in the driver’s seat with a score of 67/1.\n\nOpener Matthew Short switched gears following the powerplay, striking Corne Dry for two more sixes in the seventh over. In the eighth over, Fin Allen brought up his half-century in 23 deliveries, while Matthew Short continued to clear the ropes with ease, bringing up his half-century soon after in 23 balls too, comprising five sixes and three fours.\n\nWhen the colossal 116-run stand between Allen and Short was finally dented by Sunil Narine in the 12th over, the Unicorns were cruising to their target, needing only 29 runs in 48 balls. While Finn Allen became Spencer Johnson’s second wicket of the night in the 13th over, Josh Inglis (15), Corey Anderson (11), and Hassan Khan (2) helped the Unicorns reach their target in 15.2 overs.\n\nSpencer Johnson was the leading wicket-taker for the LA Knight Riders with figures of 3/36.\n\nEarlier, San Francisco Unicorns bowlers did well to restrict the LA Knight Riders. By the end of the powerplay, LA Knight Riders were 42/2, having lost the wickets of Sunil Narine (6) and Unmukt Chand (0). Opener Jason Roy (26) looked threatening and cracked four boundaries in his 18-ball stint before he was cleaned up by Liam Plunkett in the seventh over.\n\nThe experienced Shakib Al Hassan (35), and Nitish Kumar (20) came together to put on the biggest partnership of the innings. The pair put on 45 runs in 31 deliveries in the middle overs before Abrar Ahmed and Brody Couch dismissed the pair in consecutive overs.\n\nEarlier, San Francisco Unicorns bowlers did well to restrict the LA Knight Riders.

In their opening game of the second edition of the Major League Cricket, Saurabh Netravalkar and Justin Dill picked up three wickets each, while Glenn Maxwell and Lockie Ferguson have done a decent job. With the bat, skipper Steven Smith led by example.\n\nWhen it comes to Texas, they lost to Los Angeles Knight Riders in their opening game. Devon Conway looked sensational, as the New Zealand international hit a half-century, but the other batters struggled with the bat. Among bowlers, Zia-ul-Haq, Aaron Hardie and Marcus Stoinis picked up two wickets each, but there’s a lot of room for improvement.\n\nMatch Details\n\nPitch Report\n\nScoring runs hasn’t been easy in Morrisville. However, if a batter spends enough time in the middle, one can make a difference.

However, on his first match in the MLC 2024, the 33-year-old looked in good touch, scoring 53 runs off 39 balls. After losing the first match, Texas are under pressure and Conway would hope to help the franchise win their first match in the season.\n\nAlso Check: MLC 2024 Most Runs\n\nProbable Best Bowler: Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nUSA’s Saurabh Netravalkar had a remarkable time in the T20 World Cup. He was a key component in USA’s success and the pacer has continued with a similar momentum for Washington in the ongoing MLC. If he continues in the same rhythm, Washington can very well challenge for the title.\n\nToday’s Match Prediction: Washington Freedom to win the match\n\nScenario 1\n\nWashington Freedom win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 35-45\n\nTEX: 145-165\n\nWashington Freedom win the match\n\nScenario 2\n\nTexas Super Kings win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 35-45\n\nWAS: 155-175\n\nWashington Freedom win the match",

Allen's aggressive play during the powerplay provided the Unicorns with the momentum they needed, bringing them to a powerplay score of 66/0.\n\nDespite Noor Ahmad's quick wickets of Jake Fraser-McGurk (18) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (0), Josh Inglis added a crucial 37 from 25 deliveries to support Allen through the innings.\n\nAllen's exploits included 16-run overs off Marcus Stoinis in both the second and the 13th over, and an 18-run over off Zia Ul Haq, comprising two consecutive sixes. Hassan Khan's quick 27 off 15 balls was also vital in propelling the Unicorns to the 200-run mark.\n\nFor the Texas Super Kings, Noor Ahmad was the standout bowler, capturing key wickets and finishing with figures of 3/27. Mohammad Mohsin, Marcus Stoinis and Ottoneil Baartman also claimed a wicket each in the losing cause.\n\nIn the run chase, the Texas Super Kings opened strong with Devon Conway (62*) leading the pursuit. Pushing the pace of the innings, Conway's knock came in just 38 balls.\n\nThe New Zealander struck four fours and two sixes in an innings where he did not see enough of the strike. Faf du Plessis contributed a brisk 45 off 22, but his dismissal derailed the Texas Super Kings' momentum.\n\nWhile middle-order contributions from Aaron Hardie (19), Milind Kumar (2), and Marcus Stoinis (1) were lacking, Joshua Tromp scored a breezy 56 from 36 balls, keeping the Super Kings in the hunt until the final over.\n\nConway brought up his half-century in only 30 balls, whereas Tromp powered his way to the milestone in 31 deliveries, including four fours and two sixes.\n\nThe match came down to the wire in the last five overs, with the Texas Super Kings needing 64 runs. With the dangerous Conway and Tromp at the crease, Haris Rauf and Cummins held their nerves for the San Francisco Unicorns, delivering tight overs under pressure.\n\nCummins was pivotal in the 20th over, conceding only 7 runs when 18 were needed, showcasing experienced death bowling that ensured a Unicorns' victory.

    "body": "Ricky Ponting is the coach of Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket 2024 ©MLC\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Cricbuzz, Ricky Ponting talks about his coaching philosophy, how to work with maverick talents like Glenn Maxwell, his stint with Delhi Capitals, and why he's gone from being a hard-nosed Australian captain to someone that is more widely appreciated. Excerpts:\n\nThis is your first stint in the franchise world outside of the IPL, if I'm not wrong. Why America as a coaching destination?\n\nWell, a lot of friends of mine and coaches and guys that I'm pretty close to played in MLC last year. And during the IPL, it was spoken about a little bit, last year even about potential for some growth here and how big the game already was in the US. Everyone I spoke to last year, had a really good time and enjoyed the tournament and felt that it will just get bigger and better. So I wanted to get involved early on to have a look at it.\n\nAnd I think all of us that are here now play a role in promoting the game. Even though I'm here coaching and looking after this team Washington Freedom, I think the fact that ex-international players are being involved in a tournament like this will hopefully help it grow.\n\nIs it also a means to carve out a legacy for the Freedom franchise by leading them in their nascent stages, and basically formulating that culture, identity, and the way they go about their cricket in a manner that is on course with your beliefs and other decision makers around you?\n\nYeah, absolutely. I think Cameron White and Shawn Bradstreet were here last year along with Michael Klinger. I think they'd set a pretty good culture. The team made the playoffs, but didn't go all the way. The plan going forward for us this year was to make sure we have sustained success and as you say, build the right culture for this franchise. I think I've been lucky to be around a lot of really successful teams as a player and as a coach, and got a pretty good grasp on cultural sort of matters. It's what makes me a good coach, and what I think makes people enjoy me being around them. So that's what I continue to work on every day. Talking to a lot of the guys here, there's a lot of them that haven't been around a lot of international experience like I've been able to bring here. So that makes it more enjoyable for me to work in that sort of environment.\n\nThere are about 15 Aussies in the MLC. Most of them are your star Australian cricketers that were part of the World Cup squad. Now compare that to The Hundred where there are only four Australia cricketers. We know Aussie cricketers are a golden asset for any league, so is the cricketing world order changing right now in front of our eyes?\n\nI think the whole game is in quite an interesting phase right now with different tournaments almost popping up every year. A lot of those tournaments overlap. Even the BBL in Australia overlaps with ILT20 and also the SA20. It's good and bad for players, I guess. Players get a chance to play in lots of different competitions. But with the overlapping like we've seen with San Francisco Unicorns' Matthew Short leaving MLC early to go to play in The Hundred, that's one thing I'm not a big fan of. I don't like seeing players leave early to go and play in a different tournament, and I think it's something that needs to be addressed going forward. I think there need to be certain windows cut out for every tournament - make sure there's clean air for that tournament to get over and done with, and keep their players for the big games. I've been there before with the BBL, where you sign players up at the start and you make the finals and you lose your stars when the big games come around. That's not ideal for anybody.\n\nBut I think a lot of the players have probably had a similar attitude like me, that they wanted to have a look at MLC in the early days. Get involved early and hopefully be part of the growth. Even having someone like Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell here. As you say there are a lot of big name Australian players playing this year. And I think that's great for the tournament.\n\nWas there also the lure of leaving your imprints on a franchise and making a legacy for yourself?\n\nI don't look at it that way. I don't look at leaving legacy or imprints. I just want to get here and do the best job that I can and make sure that the players understand what I'm all about and how much I love working with good players and making them better. More importantly, understand how important winning is to me. That's the first thing I say to any group that I come to - that anything we do from here until the end of this tournament, we'll find ways to to get better and win. That attitude certainly seems to work so far this year.\n\nWith the type of personality you are, you're all in when you take up an assignment. It has come to my knowledge that you were heavily active on the team WhatsApp group, and tried to stay on top of what was going on in the practice sessions even while you were in the Caribbean. So what sort of involvement can we expect from you with Freedom in the future? Especially considering the task of bridging the gap between domestic talent and international talent.\n\nIt actually wasn't ideal for me this year as my first year with this team, considering the overlap with the World Cup. But when Michael Klinger rang me and asked me to think about the job, the first thing I said was, 'Look, I know I'm actually going to be in the Caribbean, and I'll be commentating in the World Cup final. So it's not gonna be perfect for you. It's not gonna be perfect for me.' But, I think our conversations first started maybe in about January when I was working in the BBL. Right back then when I decided to go ahead and do it, then I was the one that was reaching out to make sure we signed the right players as well. So, my involvement sort of stems back to getting Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, these guys to come and sign here and play with us.\n\nWhen I'm here, I'm obviously heavily involved. Even some of the players the last couple of days have come to me and said we can't believe how actively involved you are with throwing balls all day, every day and being out in the field and running drills and things like that. But that's my opportunity to make players better. So I don't ever want to miss a minute or a practice session where I'm not giving my best to make every player in the squad as good as they can be. That's just the way that I am. It's ingrained in me. I'm not going to sit back and waste any time around cricket. And that's one of the other things I say to the boys first off is I don't like lazy people. I don't like people with talent that don't try and get the most out of themselves. So if I can show that attitude as a retired player and almost impose on them the way that I want them to go about their cricket while I'm here then hopefully that only makes them better.\n\n'I've played 15 years of cricket with him [Justin Langer]. I actually didn't even look at him or shake his hand until the game or games were over. So that's just my competitive nature coming out' ©BCCI\n\nAs a captain, you had mentioned in your autobiography that you asked the team not to address Kevin Pietersen as 'KP', or for that matter not call any of the Englishmen by their nicknames during the 2006-07 home Ashes. You stated you were too chummy with them in the previous series and now wanted to impose yourselves on them. There was also another side to it where Justin Langer once revealed how you asked the team to be humble before the final English wicket fell in the Perth Test when you were about to clinch that series. Does franchise cricket allow for these intense mind games? Have you ever done something similar to that as a coach?\n\nYes and I'd love to give a bit of an example for that as well. One thing that I always struggled with the IPL, obviously, was that a lot of the Indian guys play in the national team together and you tend to get to the ground really early - about two hours before the game starts. And a lot of the players sort of catch up on the ground and put their arms around each other and give them a cuddle whenever they meet each other before the game starts, but I'd never do that. Justin Langer this year, for instance. I've played 15 years of cricket with him. I actually didn't even look at him or shake his hand until the game or games were over. So that's just my competitive nature coming out.\n\nIt probably doesn't change the outcome but I think it sets a pretty good idea to the opposition that I'm there to get my job done and to have my team win that game of cricket. I'll probably have been a little bit more relaxed here to be honest. I actually saw Shane Watson before our last game but the only reason we crossed paths was we were having team photos on the ground, otherwise I would have stayed away from him. Pravin Amre has been an assistant coach with me at Delhi for seven years. I didn't see him until after the game was over so that's just me, but everyone's different I guess.\n\nWhat Rishabh's been through last year is one that's probably the most emotional, with how close I was with him and what he went through and the fear of all of us that he might not play cricket again. Seeing him back and doing what he's doing and leading DC, I think it's a pretty emotional time for everyone.\n\n***\n\nSix IPL seasons with DC is quite a long time. How have you evolved as a coach over the years at DC?\n\nI actually think even though I'm quite intense, I'm a bit more relaxed as a coach now than I once was. I'm better at understanding an individual's own preparation better than I probably once was. Coming reasonably new out of the game and straight into coaching, it was easy for me to sit back and expect everyone to train the same way that I did. But that doesn't necessarily bring the best out in people.\n\nSo even in this tournament, yes we've played well, but I think we've probably only had one or two compulsory training sessions on the way. The rest of them have been optional. I've left it up to the players. I've told them that I've got full trust in them to understand what they need, as far as their preparation is concerned, if they don't come to train, that's fine. But if they come to training, make sure they come with a real intent and purpose to get something out of it and try and improve. So I think that's probably the biggest thing. I try to learn more about people quicker and understand who they are as people more so than cricketers. I think if I do that I gain respect back pretty quickly and then hopefully they'll perform for you.\n\nYou mentioned the way you adapted to allow individuals the liberty to prepare as per their individual preferences. Would you want to add to this list where you would have learned something new which quashed or sort of negated some of your beliefs regarding your own coaching philosophy?\n\nI'm still learning every day. And if I'm not then I'm probably wasting my time because you get so many people around you that you can learn from. Little things I've tried to do in this tournament is that this group has played a lot of golf together since we've been here. And one thing I've tried to do is make sure that I'm playing in the groups with the local boys for five hours a day, rather than playing with Maxwell, Smith and Head, all the guys I know. I'm wasting five hours if I do that when I can be playing with Gous and Obus and Justin Dill and these guys. That's a perfect opportunity for me to learn more about them and spend time with them and have them understand that I actually chose to play with you guys this day over playing with the Aussie guys. So I've just tried to maximise my time with them here but also make sure that I've given them their own space. I think that's another important thing for me as a coach now is you gotta understand that you are a coach, you're not one of the players.\n\nIn an interview with Cricbuzz three years back, you had mentioned how you were a relationship-based coach. Over the course of six years you might have built some strong interpersonal relationships at DC. Can you recall having some moving moments with some of the individuals at DC that will kind of stay with you for the longest time?\n\nI haven't spoken publicly about not being there next year. I sort of let it go because I was here and been paying pretty close attention to what I'm doing here. Look, I had a great time there. DC, for me, was like my second home and my family was there with me for a month or five weeks in the last three or four years. It hasn't always been the most successful franchise. So we tried to build a real family inclusive environment where everyone was treated the same and everyone was on the same page.\n\nI mean what Rishabh's been through last year is one that's probably the most emotional, with how close I was with him and what he went through and the fear of all of us that he might not play cricket again. Seeing him back and doing what he's doing and leading DC, I think it's a pretty emotional time for everyone.\n\nSo it is what it is, we've decided to part ways and we decided to move on but that doesn't mean that I won't be coaching again. I'm very keen to get back involved in the IPL. There might be a few opportunities coming up and we'll see what happens over the next few weeks.\n\nYou have been fabulous at nurturing young talent during your time as the Australian captain as well as a coach in the IPL. Speaking to some of the domestics at Washington Freedom, they haven't been short of singing your praises on the experience they had with you. What is the first quality you want to see in a young player?\n\nIt depends where you are in a scouting role, or a coaching role. You want to see skill and talent first. But my coaching mantra is based around four words. That's attitude, effort, commitment, and care. I think as a coach, it's much easier to coach skill than it is to try and change someone's attitude, or character. So, give me the right attitude and the right effort, and the right commitment, then I feel that I can make those players better, but you give me the highest skill players that don't want to change, then they're wasting everyone's time.\n\nEven in a tournament like this, where there's been a lot of players that I've seen, I sit back and say, 'Well, that kid's good, he's got some real talent.' A lot of those are the ones that we've got here, which has made working here that bit more fun. I've obviously had a lot of players on the other end of the scale. Even at DC there's a lot of players that I've coached there that are highly talented players that I haven't been able to change. It's disappointing for me and it's also disappointing for the player not to be able to understand and see how much better they can become if they really want to.\n\nPiggybacking on what you've said there is also this curious case of supremely talented Prithvi Shaw that went from the most promising to being benched in the final season at DC. How does the coach's role become important in that situation where you have to handle people with truckloads of talent who are sort of outliers?\n\nI mean to start with I don't like talking about individual players, but Prithvi shouldn't be an outlier. He should be someone that's in every team; the first pick in most teams with the skill that he's got. He's had a chance to represent India as a youngster, making a hundred on his Test debut. And as you say, halfway through this year, we couldn't find a slot for him in our DC team. So that's disappointing for me as a coach not to be able to make certain players better and get the best out of them. But sometimes there's only so much you can give and so many times you can try. When you feel like you're not making players better and they're not doing what you need for the team, then you've got to look for other players that can do it for you.\n\nSo that then comes back to the player. With him in particular I've had a lot of chats with him, a lot of conversations to try and make him a better cricketer. I mean, he's still a young man. And he's still a very talented young player. And hopefully one day the penny really drops for him and he works out what he needs to do to be the best cricketer that he can be.\n\nTravis Head, Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell are part of the Washington Freedom setup ©Getty\n\nMarcus Stoinis mentioned not too long back that Maxwell, one of your Freedom stars, is the most talented batter he has ever seen till date. An Australian media outlet reported about his Test comeback on the tour of Sri Lanka. It is this outrageous talent of his that has had Cricket Australia toying with the idea of having him back in the Test scheme of things time and again. Obviously, we all know the range of strokes that he has. That makes him extra special. But coming from your X-ray eyes, if you can dissect Maxwell the batsman, his mind and the superhuman talent that he possesses.\n\nI think Glenn's name quite often gets thrown up when it's a subcontinent tour because of what he can do with bat and ball. He gives the Australian team a lot of flexibility as far as a second spin bowling option or even sometimes a third spin bowling if they go that way. I've known Glenn for a long time, and hopefully he gets the chance to play Test cricket again. But he's really made his name for himself in white ball cricket. He's had some outrageously good moments throughout his career.\n\nGuys like that who have that X factor talent about them, I don't like to talk to them too much about their cricket. You just have to be really careful with the way that you phrase things in the way that you speak to them. Because for players that have got that sort of talent, you don't want to get in their way. You don't want to have something that you said in the back of their mind that can actually stop that X factor play coming out. So for me, it's much easier to coach the guys that have less talent and less skill because I think I can help them and give them things that they can think about that can make them better.\n\nAnd Travis is exactly the same right now. I mentioned in one of our postgame chats the other night that there's a lot of things that I could talk to Travis about with his batting but I'm not going to because it's all good. It's going so well that I don't need to get in the back of his head. I don't want to be this little voice sitting on his shoulder. I want him to play with freedom and keep doing what he's doing and Maxwell was a bit the same. So it's hard to dissect. Now that AB de Villiers and those guys aren't around, Glenn and Suryakumar are probably the most complete 360-degree players in the modern game. And with what he can bring with the other dimensions to his cricket - his fielding and with the ball - he's obviously a very, very good player.\n\nDo you think people like Glenn Maxwell are a prototype of a T20 batter 10 years from now?\n\nGlenn probably almost had some of this flamboyance coached out of him when he was young. He got out a lot playing the reverse sweep and the switch hit when he was younger. Had coaches left, right and centre and commentators and media, and probably even me being one in certain times were questioning why he was trying to do that. But if he hadn't worked on it then and he hadn't got so good at playing it, then we wouldn't see the Glenn Maxwell of now. So he's shown a lot of courage to continue to play the way that he wants to play. For 10 or 12 years now he's reaped the rewards whether that's on-field performance or certainly the money he's made from the game has been on the back of the skill set that he's had.\n\nSince we have touched the future and you are one of the most prominent voices in the game, where do you see the international cricket calendar heading towards? How does one maintain the sanctity of Test cricket? And also be mindful that franchise cricket is the real cash cow now for the international players living outside of India. There is an argument to play only Test cricket as bilaterals and the white ball cricket only in ICC tournaments. What's your opinion on that?\n\nI don't want to see any international cricket played less. I just think it's something that's been sort of happening even when I was playing. Probably when the IPL started up was when this sort of stuff started to happen. Conversations were around about franchise cricket compared to international cricket. It's got to the point now where franchise cricket is probably the most talked about and certainly the most played because there are so many leagues around the world that have been allowed to start up, and international cricket is trying to slot in around these tournaments now, which is the opposite way that it used to be.\n\nSo there's some great challenges there but I would hate to see one day cricket, for instance, only played during World Cup years. I think there's a time and a place for all three formats. Where the game gets in trouble is when we start comparing one format to the other and immediately playing a Test match on the back of a 50-over or T20 World Cup. A great example is the last T20 World Cup that was in Australia that England won, they stayed on in Australia after that to play some one-dayers against Australia and I took my son to the MCG with his U-11 team to watch a contest between Australia and England. There were something like 8000 people there. When I was playing Australia vs England at the MCG, it was 80,000 plus every game. So that's the scheduling, and that's the unfortunate thing about it. There's still as many people watching the game as ever, they're just choosing what they want to watch and when they want to watch it.\n\nIf you've just had an international Test series, don't expect the attendance to be strong for the ODI series against Sri Lanka in the West Indies immediately after it for they'll be watching it at home. So that's the one thing we have to understand. But look, I'm not sure where it's headed. Well I know where it's headed. Obviously more and more franchise-based cricket where I think we're going to see in a lot of countries like New Zealand, like the West Indies have been doing for a long time and maybe Sri Lanka, these sorts of countries that don't get paid a lot to play international cricket then they're going to be choosing franchise cricket over international stuff which is a little bit sad, but that's the reality of the world right now.\n\nFor the most part in your playing days, you were someone who non-Australian fans hated to love because of your skill, how unabashedly pro-team or pro-teammates you were, which obviously the fans from the rest of the world were not fond of. Now after retirement that is exactly the quality the fans from MI, which you coached once, DC or Freedom now love about you. You won a lot of trophies as a player, but seem to be winning more hearts as a coach. Did you expect this turn around?\n\nI don't know if I expected it, or I didn't really care too much to be honest. When I was playing, I mean everything you said there was right. All I cared about was the guys on my team and making sure I was doing the right thing by them as people and players and getting results for them. When I was the captain of the Australian cricket team, I looked at myself as a protector, my job was to protect my teammates and look after them. I was a senior player and had lots of younger players coming in. The cold, hard facts of it is that international cricket can be a tough, lonely place. Some young players need older people like me around to look after them and protect them.\n\nThe way I describe it is when I was playing, I had a helmet on, I didn't say anything, didn't give anything away. But now that I've retired and taken my helmet off, I can actually start to show the world and people that maybe that wasn't me as a person. That was me trying to do my job as an Australian cricket captain. I want people to enjoy the time that they have when I'm around them, basically. If that means that I protect them or look after them or make them better, then at the end of the day that's what my job is.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet",

    "body": "Washington Freedom convincingly beat the San Francisco Unicorns to book their place in this year’s Major League Cricket final with the elimination of MI New York in the first playoff against Texas, where the competition will crown a new winner this year. And given their stellar run in the season, where they finished on top, it seems the team representing the capital is the team to beat.\n\nIt was a dominant show all around by the Washington Freedom. Having restricted the Unicorns to 145 in 19 overs, the Washington Freedom wasted little time in chasing down the score. With destroyer-in-chief, Travis Head led the way with a dominant 77 off 44 inclusive of three sixes and ten fours. When chasing the Washington Freedom, despite losing wickets cheaply, they maintained their rhythm to cruise to a seven-wicket win.\n\nWashington Freedom Bowlers Bowl Out the Unicorns\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIn a closely fought season between the two top sides, it was interesting to see who would come out on top. The team winning the toss seems to have the advantage for the most part, and when the Freedom captain Steve Smith won the toss he elected to bowl first. And having done so his decision was backed up well as his bowlers came to the party. A major concern for the Unicorns has been the inconsistency at the top of the order. The rising star player Jake Fraser-McGurk produced another failure managing just 11 off 11 deliveries.\n\nWhat followed was a tame batting performance by the side from San Francisco as none of the top-order players made an impact. The saving grace came in the form of Hassan Khan who scored 57 off 36 and a resistant 26 off 19 by Corey Anderson. Given the lack of big scores from top-order batsmen, the Unicorns struggle to a 145 before being bowled out in the 19th over.\n\nDominant Travis Head Leads the Washington Charge\n\nTravis Head is in the form of his life. His remarkable innings in the 2023 World Cup final have set him on a cracking path of batting dominance. Opening the innings Travis Head played an unbeaten 77 off 44 delivers inclusive of 13 boundaries in total. When chasing a modest target like 145, this sort of inning knocked the wind out of the Unicorns’ sails.\n\nThe side from San Francisco despite knocking over a few Washington top-order batsmen, were unable to keep a lid on the scoring and when fellow Australia international Glen Maxwell joined the fray, the game quickly got away from the defending side. Maxwell scored a rapid 56 off 23 with five sixes: a strike rate of 234+. This was the last nail in the coffin as the Washington Freedom got home with over four overs to spare.\n\nWashington Freedom into Major League Cricket Final\n\nSo we now have a new finalist in the Major League Cricket tournament. The Washington Freedom as the most dominant side this year has booked a deserving spot in the final. The question is can they go one step further and clinch the trophy? They certainly have the team to do so, and all would wait for what becomes the final playoff game between the Texas Super Kings and the Unicorns, who have another shot at qualification.\n\nFor More Great Content",
    "summary": "* The Washington Freedom have qualified for the final of the Major League Cricket tournament after defeating the San Francisco Unicorns in the playoff.\n* The Freedom restricted the Unicorns to 145 in 19 overs and then chased down the score, winning by 7 wickets.\n* Travis Head was the star of the show, scoring 77 off 44 balls with 3 sixes and 10 fours, while Glen Maxwell also contributed with a rapid 56 off 23 balls.\n* The Freedom's dominant performance was set up by their bowlers, who bowled out the Unicorns for 145.\n* The Unicorns struggled with inconsistency at the top of their order, with rising star Jake Fraser-McGurk failing to make an impact.\n* The Washington Freedom finished top of the table in the regular season and are the team to beat in the final.\n* The other finalist will be determined by the playoff game between the Texas Super Kings and the San Francisco Unicorns.",

    "date": "Sat Jul 27 18:13:00 2024",
    "body": "Washington Freedom qualified for the final of the Major League Cricket 2024 season by winning the Qualifier against the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas on Thursday. This puts us within touching distance of our maiden MLC title.\n\nThe captain-coach duo of Steve Smith and Ricky Ponting has developed a well-knit side that has been clinical and delivered some gritty performances. As we get ready to play our first final of MLC in just its second year, here is a glance at our consistent journey so far this season, highlighting the match results and key performers.\n\nGame 1 vs MI New York, Morrisville\n\nWe started our MLC 2024 campaign with a win over defending champions MI New York by four runs under the DLS method in a rain-shortened match in Morrisville. We reached 55/1 after restricting MINY to 154/9 before rain intervened and halted further play.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar and Justin Dill shone with the ball, picking up 3/24 and 3/33, respectively, as MINY were restricted to 154 due to the regular fall of wickets.\n\nMeanwhile, our skipper Steve Smith, got off to a memorable start both as a batter and as captain. Smith’s counter-attacking display, where he scored 22 runs in a single over, got us over the line, as we were ahead of the par score when play was stopped.\n\nGame 2 vs Texas Super Kings, Morrisville\n\nOur second game in Morrisville was also affected by rain, as our match against the Texas Super Kings was called off.\n\nAfter TSK reached a huge total of 203/5, we were on track as we raced to 62/0 in just four overs. Unfortunately, we needed to complete five overs for the DLS method to calculate the par score, so the match was abandoned.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nNetravalkar got two wickets, while both Travis Head and Steve Smith got to brisk starts in a game where we shared points with TSK.\n\nGame 3 vs Seattle Orcas, Dallas\n\nThis was our first full game in MLC 2024. We were put in a tough position in the second innings, chasing 125 against the Seattle Orcas in Dallas.\n\nReduced to 64/5, the team showed grit and resilience to come back and win the match by five wickets. This was undoubtedly the most important two points we earned in the league phase.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nLockie Ferguson’s four-fer and Netravalkar’s three-wicket haul was half the job done. But it was the unbeaten sixth partnership of 63 between Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar during the chase that changed the course of the game.\n\nGame 4 vs Los Angeles Knight Riders, Morrisville\n\nWith a hard-fought win in the last game, we rose from strength to strength in our next match. We beat Los Angeles Knight Riders by eight wickets, our highest margin of victory by wickets, in Morrisville in our fourth game to cement our position on top of the points table.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nNetravalkar was again the pick among bowlers with a spell of 4/35 as Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell picked up three and two wickets, respectively. LAKR were restricted to 129, while Travis Head got his first fifty to take us home with four overs to spare.\n\nGame 5 vs MI New York, Dallas\n\nThis was our second win against MINY in the 2024 edition of the MLC. The 94-run win in Dallas was our highest in terms of runs this season and also made us the first team to qualify for the playoffs of MLC this year.\n\nAfter scoring 182/5, our bowlers did an admirable job of restricting the opposition to just 88 runs as the game came to a close with 6.3 overs remaining.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nTravis Head warmed up for the crucial matches ahead by scoring his second fifty of the tournament, while homeboy Andries Gous also scored a half-century. Rachin Ravindra’s game-changing cameo was crucial for us as we posted a big score in the first innings.\n\nHowever, Jasdeep Singh’s MLC debut was the highlight of the night. He seized the opportunity with open hands, recording figures of 3/14. Jasdeep, the player of the match, was well supported by Marco Jansen, Ferguson, and Maxwell, who each picked up two wickets.\n\nGame 6 vs Texas Super Kings, Dallas\n\nBatting first against Texas Super Kings in Dallas, we notched up our highest score in the history of MLC, 206/5. The result was a 42-run win over TSK, who scored 164 in the second innings.\n\nThis win was important too, as it helped us continue our winning momentum from the start of the season and also gave us an advantage of a top-two finish in the points table.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nOpeners Head and Smith once again set the tone as Glenn Maxwell put his all-round skills on display with a 30-plus score with the bat and a three-wicket haul with the ball.\n\nJasdeep made an impact for the second straight match in a row picking three crucial wickets as Ravindra finished with an impressive haul of 4/16.\n\nGame 7 vs San Francisco Unicorns, Dallas\n\nWe got our first defeat this season in our last league match against San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. In a third match affected by rain, we fell short by six wickets under the DLS method.\n\nIt was an excellent batting display from SFU, headlined by Sanjay Krishnamurthi with an unbeaten 79, which made our first-innings tally look inadequate.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nThe Australian trio of Smith, Head and Andrew Tye did well for us, albeit in a losing cause, with the openers scoring fifties and Tye picking up three wickets.\n\nQualifier vs San Francisco Unicorns, Dallas\n\nWe came back well in the Qualifier match of MLC 2024 in Dallas, registering a win against SFU by seven wickets to progress to the final of the event.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nIt was a clinical show from our side, with both the batters and bowlers contributing in equal measure to our win. Ravindra recorded career-best figures with the ball, as Jansen and Netravalkar too contributed.\n\nHead and Maxwell were at their imperious best as the duo smashed eight sixes and 14 boundaries among them.",
    "summary": "The Washington Freedom have qualified for the final of the MLC 2024 season by winning the Qualifier against the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. Led by the captain-coach duo of Steve Smith and Ricky Ponting, the team has been clinical and delivered gritty performances throughout the season.\n\nIn the league phase, the Freedom won five out of their seven matches, with notable wins against defending champions MI New York, Seattle Orcas, Los Angeles Knight Riders, and MI New York again. Their only loss came against San Francisco Unicorns in their last league match.\n\nKey performers for the Freedom include Steve Smith, who shone with the bat and as captain, Saurabh Netravalkar, who consistently took wickets, and Travis Head, who scored two fifties. Other notable performers include Lockie Ferguson, Glenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, Jasdeep Singh, and Marco Jansen.\n\nIn the Qualifier match, the Freedom won by seven wickets against San Francisco Unicorns, with Ravindra recording career-best figures and Head and Maxwell smashing eight sixes and 14 boundaries.

    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nWith six wins from eight games in the 2024 edition of Major League Cricket including victory in the qualifier, many see this as Washington Freedom’s lose, but anything can happen in a final and San Francisco Unicorns will believe that they if play their best cricket, the trophy will be bound for the Golden State.\n\nDATE & TIME: Sunday 28th July 2024 - USA ET – 8:30pm / USA PT – 5:30pm / West Indies – 7:30pm / Monday 29th July 2024 - UK – 1:30am / South Africa – 2:30am / Pakistan - 5:30am / India – 6:00am / Bangladesh – 6:30am / Australia – 10:30am\n\nVENUE: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, Texas, United States\n\nWEATHER: Extremely hot conditions with temperatures at around 30c come the start of play.\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – Sony Sports / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – TBA\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – discovery+ / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – Sony LIV / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia & New Zealand – Amazon Prime Video\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM FORM: UNICORNS WITH LITTLE TIME TO RECOVER FROM DEFEAT\n\nWashington Freedom gained their revenge on the Unicorns for ruining their unbeaten league stage campaign by beating them in the all-important qualifier to book their place in Sunday’s night’s final in Dallas. The win came by seven wickets, the Freedom bowling out San Francisco for 145, before chasing that target down in just 15.3 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: WLW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: CAN SUPER KINGS SECURE A MUCH-CRAVED HOME FINAL\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns may have been put in their place by Washington in a qualifier, but showed huge guts and class to bounce back in the challenger, breaking the hearts of home team Texas Super Kings. The Unicorns made 200/6 in a high-scoring thriller, which they ultimately won by 10 runs, restricting Texas to 190/4.\n\nLAST THREE: WLW\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe two Washington Freedom openers being the second and third highest scoring batters in the tournament is testament to the strength of their top order. Travis Head’s 77 not out in the qualifier took his overall tally to 327, whilst opening partner Steve Smith boasts 248 runs of his own. The smart move would be placing a stake on both via the ‘Team - Top Batter’ and also backing the pair to each record over 30+ match runs.\n\nSo often a left-arm pacer can prove worth their weight in gold across the T20 format and Marco Jansen demonstrated that last time out, taking three wickets against San Francisco. Jansen’s height poses an additional threat in regards to generation extra bounce and making a play for the South African to pick up over 1.5 match wickets looks good value.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nOnce again, Finn Allen was the star for San Francisco Uniforms in the challenger having accumulated one of his best individual innings in T20 cricket. It was his 101 off 53 balls which ensured an eventual winning total for the Unicorns vs Texas. He will have a huge role to play in the final and on the back of such a brilliant score, is worth backing to accrue over 24.5 match runs here. His six-hitting abilities could also warrant investment, specifically via the ‘Batter Total Match Sixes’ market.\n\nOn the bowling front, Hassan Khan has taken three wickets across the play-offs so far and his left-arm orthodox slow bowling has been tricky to deal with from an opposition point of view. You’d expect Hassan to bowl his four-over allocation in the final and a stake on him to pick up 2+ wickets via the ‘Bowler Milestones’ market is worth serious consideration.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERTPREDICTION\n\nThe last time these two teams met, Washington Freedom demonstrated their class in all departments. Outplaying San Francisco with bat and ball, the Freedom have shown why they’ve set the standard throughout this year’s edition of Major League Cricket. Having a world class top order that combines control with aggression has been key to their success, whilst all avenues are well-covered within the bowling department.\n\nPlenty depends on Finn Allen from a San Francisco point of view, but if he was to fail then you would worry about the Unicorns’ depth, particularly if Washington was to take a cluster of early wickets. With just one defeat across the tournament so far, in a game that had precious little at stake from their point of view, Washington Freedom have been outstanding and the expectation is that they will take that final step and emerge triumphant in the second year of Major League Cricket.",

    "body": "The Washington Freedom, led by Steve Smith, have been crowned the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 champions after a decisive 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe skipper’s blistering 88 runs off just 52 balls propelled Washington Freedom to a commanding total of 207-5. The bowlers then went on the rampage, bowling out the opposition for a mere 111 runs.\n\nThe Unicorns skipper Corey Anderson elected to bowl first after winning the toss. This decision paid off early as Travis Head was dismissed cheaply, leaving the Freedom at a precarious 86-3 midway through the innings. In the second half of the innings, Smith and Glenn Maxwell batted relentlessly and tormented the Unicorns bowlers.\n\nA 22-ball 40-run blitz from Maxwell, along with quick-fire innings from Mukhtar Ahmed and Obus Pienaar, propelled the team past the 200-run mark.\n\nThe Washington side displayed clinical efficiency with both their bowling and batting. Meanwhile, the San Francisco Unicorns were overwhelmed by the demanding run rate from the start, losing their top order batsmen within the first five overs.\n\nThe left-arm pace of Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar proved devastating during the powerplay and mounted pressure on the Washington Freedom. Led by Anderson, the side struggled, losing wickets at regular intervals and limping to 68-7 by the halfway mark.\n\nCameos from Pat Cummins and Carmi le Roux propelled the team to a triple-digit total. However, the match’s outcome soon became inevitable. Rachin Ravindra sealed the victory by claiming his third wicket, dismissing Juanoy Drysdale with the final delivery of the 16th over.\n\nTexas Super Kings skipper Faf du Plessis of the finished the tournament as the top scorer, amassing 420 runs. Meanwhile, Washington Freedom pacer Saurabh Netravalkar was the tournament’s top wicket-taker, claiming 15 dismissals.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom’s (WF) dominant run in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 ended with a deserving win in the final, hammering San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) by a massive margin of 96 runs.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, Travis Head and Steven Smith, who have been the best batters of MLC 2024 were not able to give a good start as the former was dismissed for nine in the second over. Captain Smith stood at one end and got great support from Andries Gous, Rachin and Glenn Maxwell, bringing their side into the game.\n\nMaxwell & Smith’s aggressive 83-run partnership between over 11-17 pushed Washington’s potential total from 180 to 200+. Maxwell’s 40 of 22 and final over fireworks from Mukhtar Ahmed and Obus Pienaar resulted in Washington Freedom posting a huge total of 207/5 at the end of 20 overs. Pat Cummins was the pick of the bowlers for San Francisco as he finished with 2/35, while Hassan Khan, Haris Rauf and Juanoy Drysdale picked up a wicket apiece.\n\nChasing 208, the San Francisco Unicorns lost their youthful top order in the first five overs as Marco Jansen sent back both openers in Jake Fraser-McGurk and Finn Allen early. The Washington bowlers gave no room for San Francisco batters to open their arms as they ran through their batting line-up, bowling them out for just 111 runs and clinching their first-ever MLC Title. Jansen and Rachin picked up three wickets each with Tye taking two and Maxwell and Netravalkar sharing one wicket each.\n\nWith complete domination in batting, bowling and fielding, Washington Freedom led by Smith and coached by Ricky Ponting won the second edition of Major League Cricket.\n\nFinal: Washington Freedom beat San Francisco Unicorns by 96 runs\n\nTop performers of MLC 2024\n\nHits of MLC 2024\n\nTravis Head (Washington Freedom)\n\nTravis Head had an outstanding MLC 2024. Making his debut in MLC, Head came in with a huge reputation for being a destructive opener after his heroics in IPL 2024 and ICC T20WC 2024. He lived up to the hype as the South Australian smashed 336 runs at a massive strike rate of 174. He smashed five consecutive fifties and outplayed the oppositions almost single handedly. Apart from winning the championship, he was awarded the “Player of the Tournament” award for his match-winning knocks.\n\nSteven Smith (Washington Freedom)\n\nSteven Smith redeemed himself in T20 cricket through a championship-winning season for Washington Freedom. He stepped up as both batter and captain as he led his team to the title, winning seven of the nine games. With the bat, he proved his mettle as an opener. He smashed 336 runs at an average of 56 with a strike rate of 149, smashing three fifties, with the most important one coming in the final.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom)\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar had an excellent season. He was the highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets in seven innings at an outstanding strike rate of 10.5. The experience of playing the big teams in ICC T20WC 2024 helped Netravalkar become an even better bowler in MLC 2024.\n\nRashid Khan (MI New York)\n\nRashid Khan was one of the few positives for the relatively below-par season for inaugural champions MI New York. He showcased his all-round capabilities as he picked up 10 wickets, maintaining a good economy of 6.2. He stepped up the bat, too, scoring 162 runs in seven innings with two fifties. His strike rate of 178 with the bat was the third-best for a batter in MLC 2024.\n\nMisses of MLC 2024\n\nSunil Narine (LA Knight Riders)\n\nSunil Narine had a horror season with both bat and ball. With the bat, he scored just 27 runs in six innings at an average of just 4.5, which is the lowest for a batter this season. He did not even reach a double-digit score in any of the six games. As a bowler, he managed just five wickets in six innings, even though he put the batters under pressure with an economy of 6.2. His failure with bat and ball impacted his captaincy as the LA Knight Riders failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nKieron Pollard (MI New York)\n\nKieron Pollard, too, was another captain who was a burden on his own team during MLC 2024. Leading MI New York, the big West Indian managed just 64 runs in seven innings. He averaged 12.6 and scored at a strike rate of 98, which was un-Pollard-like. He picked up five wickets in seven games as the occasional bowler. His overall performance did not live up to a captain’s standards.\n\nJake Fraser McGurk (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe Victorian sensation Jake Fraser McGurk had an MLC to forget as he was one of the least impactful players for the eventual runners-up, San Francisco Unicorns. In seven innings, he managed just 81 runs at an average of 11.6. He had a below-par strike rate of 126 and failed to cross even 20 runs in the seven innings.\n\nHaris Rauf (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nHaris Rauf had a quiet MLC 2024, as he managed just four wickets in nine games. His economy was also on the higher side as he gave away runs at 9.1 runs/over. His bowling strike rate of 48.5 was the worst for a bowler in MLC 2024. He went wicketless in six of the nine games.\n\nBreakout performers in MLC 2024\n\nHassan Khan (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe 25-year-old all-rounder Hassan Khan had a breakout performance in MLC 2024. Representing San Francisco Unicorns, the attacking batter came at the lower order (6-8) and smashed 204 runs at an average of 40.8 with a strike rate of 144. With the ball, the left-arm spinner picked up 10 wickets in seven innings with an economy of 7.1 and a strike rate of 13.2. He was a standout performer for his team as he was their highest wicket-taker and second-highest run-scorer over Matt Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Josh Inglis and others.\n\nUnique Statistical Milestones\n\nAustralian players to score five consecutive fifties in a T20 tournament\n\nDavid Warner - IPL 2019\n\nTravis Head - MLC 2024\n\nHighest win% for an Australian Captain in T20Is (50+ matches)\n\n64.1 - Ashton Turner\n\n63.3 - Steven Smith\n\n62.2 - Adam Voges\n\n61.3 - Moises Henriques\n\n61.1 - Daniel Christian",

He is currently the second leading run-scorer in the tournament with 327 runs in 8 matches and needs another 94 runs to finish at the pole position.\n\nTop Pick – All-Rounder\n\nGlenn Maxwell recorded his first half-century of the tournament in the Qualifier against Unicorns where he struck an unbeaten 54* from just 23 balls. Overall, he made 113 runs and picked up 9 wickets.\n\nTop Pick – Bowler\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar has the uncanny knack of picking wickets and tops the leading wicket-takers chart in the tournament with 14 scalps in 6 matches he played.\n\nTop Pick – Wicketkeeper\n\nJosh Inglis looks in decent touch, having scores of 37, 8, 45, and 24* in his last 4 innings. He is likely to bat at No.4 for Unicorns.\n\nX-Factor:\n\nRachin Ravindra bowled exceedingly well in the Qualifier against Unicorns, returning with the figures of 4 for 11 in only 2.4 overs he bowled. In 6 matches in the tournament, he scored 88 runs and picked up 9 wickets.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Suggested Teams for WAS vs SF, Major League Cricket 2024, Final?\n\n1.

Josh Inglis, Steven Smith, Travis Head, Finn Allen (c), Sherfane Rutherford, Sanjay Krishnamurthy, Glenn Maxwell (vc), Hassan Khan, Marco Jansen, Carmi le Roux, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nWashington Freedom drilled San Francisco Unicorns by 7 wickets in the Qualifier to reach the final for the first time. It took them only 15.3 overs to chase the modest 145, thanks to merciless hitting from Australia duo Travis Head (77*) and Glenn Maxwell (54*). Special credits to the bowlers who bowled in tandem, especially spinners Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell who rallied through the middle overs where the latter picked up 4 wickets while Marco Jansen who took the new cherry, claimed 3 scalps despite going 11.5 runs an over. They are a strong batting side with Travis Head firing at the top and with Glenn Maxwell back in form, they are hard to beat. The support from the bowlers is exceptional with Saurabh Netravalkar claiming 14 wickets, the most in the tournament. Lockie Ferguson walked off the field after tweaking his hamstring during the Qualifier contest and it’s a concern for the management if he doesn’t recover on time for the finals.",

Smith's innings was a masterclass in controlled aggression, while Maxwell's explosive batting provided the necessary fireworks to propel the team to a formidable total.\n\nThe Unicorns, in response, were immediately put on the back foot. Jake Fraser-McGurk fell early, dismissed for just 3 runs in the third over. The situation worsened when Marco Jansen delivered a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen, who had been the hero in the qualifier with a century, for a mere 13 runs. With the scoreboard reading 30/3, the Unicorns found themselves in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued as Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) fell early, extinguishing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, who was brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, further tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then cleaned out the tail with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the ultimate match of the tournament, the team from Washington lost Head (9) early. Then, Steve Smith (88) took centre stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock. He found support in Andries Gous (21), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, finding the boundary with ease.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40) joined Smith and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as both Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith's departure, followed shortly by Maxwell's, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. The Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) beat San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs\n\nTOURNAMENT AWARDS:\n\nWINNERS: Washington Freedom\n\nRUNNERS-UP: San Francisco Unicorns\n\nSTAKE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Travis Head (Washington Freedom)\n\nROYAL RICE LEADING RUN SCORER: Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings)\n\nWILLOW BY CRICBUZZ LEADING WICKET TAKER: Saurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom)",

Really pleased for the boys. Some guys don't get a game but they are surely part of the squad, and we try to make them feel included. Everyone in this group has been outstanding. Everyone stood up at different times, our batting was pretty strong and Marco maybe didn't get to bat throughout the tournament. On the batting front, Travis was spectacular and he rightly won Player of the Tournament. With our bowling, I thought Netravalkar was outstanding and Lockie who missed today due to injury was outstanding as well. Everyone stood up for us.\"",

Smith and Australia team-mate Glenn Maxwell dominated with the bat then Unicorns' chase disintegrated with Marco Jansen claiming both openers among his three wickets.\n\nThe result cemented Freedom's standing as the team of the season having secured five wins in the group stage before progressing direct to the final with victory over Unicorns in the Qualifier. This contest turned their way through a stand of 83 off 39 balls between Smith and Maxwell as Freedom added 121 in the second half of their innings.\n\nSmith, who was overlooked for Australia's T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, overcame a sluggish start in the powerplay to make 88 off 52 balls including six sixes. Having been 10 off 12 balls in the sixth over he sped to a 34-ball fifty and ended the season as the joint second-leading run-scorer, alongside Travis Head, with 336 at a strike-rate of 148.67.\n\nHead, who has struck at over 170 during the tournament, fell early to Pat Cummins when he edged to slip, where Finn Allen held on at the second attempt, having been given a life in the opening over. But Andries Gous gave Freedom's innings impetus as Smith found his feet although when Haris Rauf removed Rachin Ravindra after the midway mark, it was an even contest at 86 for 3.\n\nThen Smith and Maxwell, the latter having found form in the closing stages of the tournament, took charge included 28 coming off the 13th over from Juanoy Drysdale. Smith produced an outrageous scoop for six off Rauf and was in sight of a century when he got a top edge off Cummins.\n\nIt appears likely that Smith's T20I career is over following his World Cup omission and absence from the squad to face Scotland and England in September as the selectors look to the future, but it has been a profitable few weeks for him in the US.\n\nThough Maxwell also fell in the next over, superbly caught by Josh Inglis, Freedom were still able to cross 200.\n\nUnicorns' chase never got off the ground. Jake Fraser-McGurk's low-key tournament ended when he edged into the stumps against Jansen to leave him with 81 runs at 11.57 then both Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Allen also fell inside the powerplay to leave a daunting task. Sherfane Rutherford was superbly caught at deep backward square by Ian Holland the ball after being dropped and the rest of the batting fell away amid a huge asking rate.\n\nFreedom's victory gave Ricky Ponting a title as coach a couple of weeks after leaving his role with Delhi Capitals.\n\nAndrew McGlashan is a deputy editor at ESPNcricinfo",
    "summary": "**Result:** Washington Freedom won the MLC 2024 title by defeating San Francisco Unicorns by 96 runs.\n\n**Score:** Washington Freedom scored 207 for 5, with Steven Smith scoring 88 off 52 balls and Glenn Maxwell scoring 40. San Francisco Unicorns were bowled out for 111.\n\n**Standout Performers:** Steven Smith was the joint second-leading run-scorer in the tournament with 336 runs at a strike rate of 148.67.

    "body": "Steve Smith's love affair with the United States deepened as the star batter reminded national selectors of his T20 prowess in a Major League Cricket final that had a distinctly Australian flavour.\n\nPat Cummins was immense for his San Fransisco Unicorns, whose ties to Silicon Valley and the world of venture capital lured the Test captain to the franchise, but was trumped by a jaw-dropping hand from Smith (88 off 52 balls) at Dallas' Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nThe decider of the MLC's second season was unmistakably American. A pre-game rendition of Star Spangled Banner played on electric guitar was followed by a drone light show as the 'half-time' entertainment.\n\nCommentators donned cowboy hats in keeping with the Texas venue that hosted the T20 World Cup opener last month, while sixes struck into the 7,000-strong crowd were measured in feet.\n\nBut the myriad Australians involved – eight of the 22 finalists, head coaches Ricky Ponting (Washington) and Shane Watson (San Fransisco), as well as the bulk of their assistants – left their mark on the competition's pinnacle match contested by the Cricket Victoria-aligned Unicorns and the Cricket NSW-aligned Freedom.\n\nWashington captain Smith, who owns an apartment in New York City, carted six sixes as he shared in a 83-run onslaught with Glenn Maxwell. Their union lasted 38 deliveries and essentially decided the match.\n\n\"He's been absolutely brilliant,\" Ponting said of Smith. \"He's pretty much singlehandedly won that game with the bat.\n\n\"I spoke to him before the game this morning and said, 'Look, if you play well, you show your class, you can win this game by yourself'. He's been awesome - his on-field leadership has been great.\"\n\nCummins (2-35 from four overs) had dismissed Smith's opening partner Travis Head with the new ball, but was then curiously held back by captain Corey Anderson as Smith and Maxwell torched the Unicorns' less credentialled bowlers.\n\nMaxwell hit four sixes en route to a 22-ball 40 but not even he could keep up with his long-time national teammate. He applauded when Smith, left out of Australia's T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, scooped Haris Rauf for the most daring of his six sixes.\n\nBy the time Cummins returned to dismiss Smith with a faster bouncer, and wicketkeeper Josh Inglis then leapt to take a stunning one-hander to account for Maxwell the following over, the damage had been done.\n\nWashington's 5-207, the highest score of this MLC season, proved 96 too many for San Fransisco, skittled for 111 with Inglis' 18 surpassed only by tailender Carmi le Roux hitting 20 in junk time.\n\nIt was the culmination of an impressive season from the Smith and Ponting-led Washington side that lost just one match all season.\n\nTheir other opener, Head, was named tournament MVP after hitting five consecutive fifties leading into the final, finishing with 336 runs at a strike-rate of 173.\n\n\"Everyone stood up at different times,\" said Smith.\n\n\"Our batting was strong – I don't think Marco (Jansen, the South Africa allrounder) even got a bat throughout the tournament batting at number eight.\n\n\"Travis Head was outstanding, it was nice to bat up the other end from him. He makes things a lot easier for me.\"\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk's fizzling follow-up to his breakout Indian Premier League campaign was capped as the Unicorns opener was dismissed for three to become the first of three Powerplay victims to the Freedom's left-arm pace pair, Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nWisconsin-born, Melbourne-raised Ian Holland had given Fraser-McGurk a life first ball when he fumbled a catch at point, but made up for his error when he took a tremendous diving outfield grab off Sherfane Rutherford amid a strong finish to the tournament for Maxwell (1-14).\n\nAndrew Tye (2-12), a late inclusion after Kiwi speedster Lockie Ferguson missed due to injury, got revenge over Inglis check-driving him for six by bowling his Perth Scorchers teammate to all but confirm Washington's triumph.\n\nAustralia's influence on the competition is certain to stretch beyond this season; Victoria and NSW have made long-term commitments to their Unicorns and Freedom franchises, while Cummins holds a four-year deal with the Unicorns, opening the door for other leading Australian to potentially join him in signing multi-year deals.",
    "summary": "* The MLC final was played between the Washington Freedom and the San Francisco Unicorns, with a distinctly Australian flavor, featuring eight Australians among the 22 finalists.\n* Steve Smith led the Washington Freedom to victory, scoring 88 off 52 balls, including six sixes, and shared an 83-run partnership with Glenn Maxwell.\n* The Freedom, led by Smith and coach Ricky Ponting, posted the highest score of the season, 207, which proved to be 96 runs too many for the Unicorns.\n* Pat Cummins, playing for the Unicorns, took 2-35 from four overs, but was outshone by Smith's batting performance.\n* Travis Head, the Freedom's opener, was named tournament MVP after hitting five consecutive fifties, finishing with 336 runs at a strike-rate of 173.\n* The Australian influence on the competition is set to continue, with Victoria and NSW making long-term commitments to their franchises, and Cummins holding a four-year deal with the Unicorns.",

Appreciated the bowlers as well to take on the pressure and perform well. He then moves on to collect the winning trophy.\n\nTravis Head is the Player of the Tournament for his consistent performance, scoring 336 runs for his team consisting of five half-centuries.. He says that he is looking forward to the few weeks off after this and he feels delighted to clinch the title. Adds that a few afternoon naps helps him chill before the game and then think of what to do when you arrive for training and see what the bowlers are bowling. Mentions that he is enjoying his life in USA and he has had a brilliant time even off the field playing Golf. Says that he and Smith complement each other and it felt nice to have a familiar face on the other end.\n\nThe Bart King Award for the best domestic player of the tournament goes to Hassan Khan for his all-round performance. He says that it has been a wonderful tournament and he is happy to contribute to the team's cause. Adds that he is fortunate for him to perform well with the bat and spend some time out in the middle. Says that the strength he has while batting is natural and mentions that the management trusted his batting and allowed him to bat higher up the order. Feels that having Pat Cummins in their dressing room was a valuable experience and he learned a lot from him.\n\nCorey Anderson, the captain of San Francisco Unicorns is up for a chat. He says they are extremely disappointed as they came here expecting to lift the trophy and failed to do so. Adds the Smith and Maxwell partnership took the game away from them and it is hard to stop those guys when they are on song and they failed to execute their plans. Mentions they came out confident while chasing this total but they lost wickets early and they faded very quickly in the pace and lost their way in the chase. Says he is proud of the side and the way the players have played throughout. Closes by saying that this competition is going from strength to strength and is on the way up as we see more and more International stars featuring here.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw a very strong batting performance from Washington Freedom. Steven Smith had to do the heavy lifting for a major part of the innings but when partnered with Glenn Maxwell, the runs came in from both ends and took them to a strong position. A sudden boost by Mukhtar Ahmed at the end powered them past 200. In the bowling department, it was Pat Cummins with his two wickets who shone out. Carmi le Roux had an off day and went wicketless while the others got one each.\n\nAndries Gous says it has been awesome and all players dream of lifting such a trophy. Mentions that this is such an amazing feeling to be crowned as champions. Thanks the fans for their support and the number in which they have come out to support them. Closes by saying that everybody wants to come to the USA and such a quality tournament will help their cause.\n\nRachin Ravindra from Washington Freedom is up for a short chat as well. He says he loved to play with so many international stars and the way the Aussie core planned and executed the skills shows why they are a champion side. Mentions that the boys had done the job early with both bat and ball and all he needed to do was pick up the last few at the end.\n\nRicky Ponting, the coach of Washington Freedom is up for a chat and says he arrived a bit late and left the training to the staff. Says that the backroom support was just tremendous. Mentions that Smith pretty much won the game single-handedly with the way he played and he executed what we had planned which was to play the natural way and not let the occasion get big on anyone. Mentions that the condition they have had has been fantastic and the way the sides have performed throughout the season has been brilliant as well.\n\nWe have some interviews lined up. Starting with Saurabh Netravalkar who says that he is grateful for this platform and sharing the dressing room with such stars is a nice feeling. Mentions that this could well be the backbone of domestic cricket for the USA and the crowd coming in is a good sign of things to come. Andrew Tye joins him and agrees with Netravalkar. He adds that it is a nice feeling to work with the unit and they learn a lot by picking their brains.\n\nWashington Freedom started off extremely well with the early wicket of Marco Jansen. Saurabh Netravalkar soon followed up in his second over. Jansen got rid of the dangerous Finn Allen as well to put his team in a strong spot. Glenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, and Andrew Tye worked in tandem to take 4 wickets in 3 overs. Jansen got rid of Hassan Khan and that left them with the bowlers to deal with. Rachin Ravindra did the cleaning up towards the end and sealed a win for them. Ravindra was the pick of the bowlers for his spell of 4-0-23-3 along with Marco Jansen with his spell of 4-1-28-3. Andrew Tye clinched two while Glenn Maxwell and Saurabh Netravalkar, who is the leading wicket-taker in this series ended his season with one to his name.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns had a shaky start. They didn’t look comfortable and Jake Fraser-McGurk succumbed first. Sanjay Krishnamurthy and Finn Allen couldn’t stitch a partnership and got sent back in a span of one over. Sherfane Rutherford, Josh Inglis, and Corey Anderson too couldn’t make any significant impact and played rash shots to throw their wicket away. Those three could only get 23 runs on the board. The Unicorns slipped from being 30/1 in 3.4 overs to 53/6 in 8.3 overs. That period was the one where the game slipped out completely from their hands. Cummins came in and played some lusty blows along with Hassan Khan but the curtains were already drawn for their side. It was then onto the bowlers who tried to free their arms before being cleaned up for 111 in 16 overs.\n\nW\n\nOvers15.6\n\nScore111 - 10\n\nRachin Ravindra to Juanoy Drysdale, OUT! CASTLED! That was the final nail in the coffin for San Francisco Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra seals things off and Drysdale departs. Looped full, turning away. Juanoy Drysdale misses his drive yet again and the ball turns away from his blade to crash into the off pole. He has been very handy with the ball for Washington Freedom and has always been the go-to bowler for Steven Smith throughout the tournament.\n\nW\n\nOvers13.5\n\nScore92 - 9\n\nRachin Ravindra to Haris Rauf, OUT! Goes down the track, misses and the keeper does the rest. Tossed up outside off, Haris Rauf dances down the track and looks to slog this but misses out completely. The ball is gathered by the keeper and Gous removes the bails with Rauf still wandering outside his crease.",
