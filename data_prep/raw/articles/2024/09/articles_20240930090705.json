        "body": "Franchises in Major League Cricket are still in an \"investment mode\", but confidence remains high over the direction of America's well-heeled pro T20 league.\n\nAfter a successful launch, where financial expectations were surpassed, MLC had the tough task of backing up just days following the T20 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S.\n\nThere was always going to be a wearing of the novelty factor, but the injection of marquee international players - highlighted by Australian superstar Pat Cummins - helped MLC roll on.\n\nForbesHaving Lured Cricket Superstar Pat Cummins, San Francisco Unicorns Boast Silicon Valley Edge\n\nThere is a lot at stake with cricket making steps to finally shed its invisibility in the world's biggest sports market. More than $100 million has been invested in the MLC by influential Indian businessmen, some of whom are ensconced in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe six-team tournament has been able to lure high-profile international cricketers through attractive salaries competitive with the top T20 leagues in the world outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier League.\n\nBut these savvy businessmen well know that start-ups take time to yield a profit. \"We are still in an investment mode,\" San Francisco Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman told me. \"I don't think we are anywhere close to breaking even or anything like that.\n\n\"It'll probably take us a few years to get there, but things seem to be progressing in the right direction. We've done quite well in terms of sponsorships and I'm hoping that continues to grow.\"\n\nGrowing the tournament and tapping into a wider fan base might be tied with infrastructure of cricket grounds. MLC has primarily been played in Dallas, with its former baseball stadium in Grand Prairie becoming the hub of cricket in the U.S.\n\nTexas is the only franchise with a home ground, with San Francisco, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Seattle and MI New York all still trying to find permanent facilities.\n\nSan Francisco had earmarked a site in Santa Clara, but are currently widening their search although the cricket ground will most likely be in Silicon Valley. There is urgency with venues still being sought for the cricket competitions at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nForbesThe Bay Area Could Host Cricket Matches At Los Angeles Olympics\n\n\"It's (turning a profit) probably going to be tied to when we can play games locally...have that permanent stadium,\" Rajaraman said. \"Once you have that then we can have other sources of revenue.\n\n\"We're looking for support from local governments to help us because it's not financially feasible for a team to foot the entire bill. For local governments to make this happen would be great and very exciting when it happens.\"\n\nIt was a successful season for the Unicorns, who finished runners-up as their strategy to focus on analytics and data in an effort to build a Silicon Valley identity paid off. The franchise plans to use its partnership with Cricket Victoria to good use.\n\n\"We'll be working on developing our domestic players and sending them for coaching and training in Australia,\" Rajaraman said. \"We used data and analytics quite significantly and we are keen to continue to push the envelope on that moving forward.\"",
        "summary": "**Current State**: The MLC franchises are still in an \"investment mode\" and have not yet broken even, but confidence remains high about the direction of the league.\n\n**Financial Investment**: Over $100 million has been invested in the MLC by influential Indian businessmen, including those based in Silicon Valley.\n\n**_attraction of International Players**: The league has been able to attract high-profile international cricketers, such as Australian superstar Pat Cummins, with attractive salaries competitive with top T20 leagues worldwide.\n\n**Infrastructure Challenges**: While the MLC has primarily been played in Dallas, the other five franchises (San Francisco, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Seattle, and MI New York) are still seeking permanent facilities. San Francisco is currently searching for a site in Silicon Valley.\n\n**Path to Profitability**: Turning a profit is likely tied to the establishment of permanent stadiums, which would allow for additional revenue streams.\n\n**Key to Growth**: Growing the tournament and tapping into a wider fan base are critical to the league's success, and infrastructure development is a key part of this growth.\n\n** Plans for the Future**: The San Francisco Unicorns plan to continue using data and analytics to build their team and are partnering with Cricket Victoria to develop domestic players and send them for coaching and training in Australia."
