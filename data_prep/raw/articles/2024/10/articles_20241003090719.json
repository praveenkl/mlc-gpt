The 2024 MLC season has already attracted high-profile names, including Australia’s captain Pat Cummins, who signed a lucrative contract with the San Francisco Unicorns, extending until 2027.\n\nOther Australian stars like Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head featured in this year’s championship-winning Washington Freedom squad, managed by Ricky Ponting.\n\nALSO READ: [Watch] RCB star sends ball into car park with humungous six off Mohammad Amir in CPL 2024\n\nAnderson remains confident of his fitness and ability to perform\n\nAnderson, who retired from international cricket after the first Test against the West Indies at Lord’s in July, closed his career with 704 Test wickets. Although he stepped away from international matches, Anderson immediately joined England’s coaching staff and remains contracted with the ECB until September.\n\nIn a recent interview, Anderson confirmed he will continue serving as a fast-bowling coach for England during their upcoming Test series against Pakistan in October, as well as their December tour of New Zealand.\n\nAnderson hasn’t played a competitive T20 match since 2014, when he represented Lancashire in the T20 Blast. Having focused primarily on red-ball cricket over the last decade, he has yet to participate in franchise leagues abroad. However, he recently expressed confidence in his fitness and ability to still perform in the format.",
