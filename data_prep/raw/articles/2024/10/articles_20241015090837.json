It is an incredible Club, and it was an honour to have represented them,” Plunkett said.\n\n“The opportunities and professionalism provided by being part of the Surrey team is an experience I will cherish and take with me in my future endeavours. I would like to send my gratitude and best wishes to Alec and the rest of the Surrey family.\n\n“Moving onto the next phase of my career, I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to join Major League Cricket and focus my attention on helping to grow the sport in the United States. I’ve enjoyed a fantastic career with England, and after retiring from international cricket, I am delighted to be able to help build the sport in America in both playing and coaching capacities.\n\n“In addition, I am looking forward to supporting the team closest to our home in the US by being able to play for The Philadelphians in Minor League Cricket.”\n\nPlunkett, whose last international appearance came in the 2019 World Cup final, recently represented Welsh Fire in the inaugural edition of The Hundred.",
