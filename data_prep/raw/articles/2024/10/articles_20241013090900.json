        "body": "Heinrich Klaasen says he was mentally drained after the Proteas’ heartbreaking loss to India in the T20 World Cup final in June.\n\nSouth Africa suffered a seven-run defeat in Barbados having at one stage needed 30 runs from 30 balls with six wickets in hand.\n\nKlaasen, who blasted a superb 52 from 27 balls, was left shattered, but had to go straight into a Major League Cricket campaign with the Seattle Orcas.\n\n“I felt a bit burnt out after the T20 World Cup because I played five days after,” he told Rapport newspaper. “I played in three T20 finals this year – for the Durban Super Giants [SA20], for the Sunrisers Hyderabad [IPL] and for South Africa [losing all three]. Mentally I was very tired.”\n\nKlaasen went on to score just 97 runs in six innings for Seattle at an average of 16.16 and a strike rate of 116.86.\n\n“I made the commitment early on to play for them, and explained afterwards that I was mentally drained, and they understood,” he said.\n\nKlaasen was rested for the Proteas’ recent white-ball ball matches against Afghanistan and Ireland, and marked his return to South African cricket with 71* off 32 balls for the Titans in their T20 Challenge win against Boland on Wednesday.\n\nFull story",
        "summary": "Heinrich Klaasen, a South African cricketer, played for the Seattle Orcas in the Major League Cricket campaign immediately after the T20 World Cup. However, he felt mentally drained due to his recent losses in three T20 finals and performed poorly in the MLC, scoring only 97 runs in six innings at an average of 16.16 and a strike rate of 116.86. Despite his poor performance, the Seattle Orcas understood his situation and were supportive."
