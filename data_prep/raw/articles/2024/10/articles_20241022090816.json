        "body": "Curtains down on the group stages of the second edition of Major League Cricket. Over to the playoffs. Tune in tomorrow for the Eliminator - Texas Super Kings vs MI New York. For now, goodbye...\n\nFaf du Plessis: It was important for a few guys to get some time in the middle. We changed our batting order a little bit. Someone like Milind scoring 25 today is important for tomorrow. Someone like Calvin Savage - good with the bat, tried him with the ball as well just see what that'd look like for the combination tomorrow. That was the purpose. Rest for some of the boys to make sure their bodies are fresh. For some other guys, get some time in the middle. We definitely had an eye on tomorrow, we are not going to lie about that. Our focus - even at the back end - was bowling to this guy, looking ahead to the plans for tomorrow. It was a dead rubber and we all focussed on getting things right for tomorrow.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen: It's difficult, it's proper difficult. When guys are little bit out of form, it makes it even more difficult. Injury upsets the balance of the team. When you start chopping and changing, you're searching for a lot and in seven game to get it right, it's very tough. The bowling group was fantastic. They didn't have enough runs to either bowl at or the batters just couldn't chase anything down. The batting group searched quite a lot for answers, we were lacking 15-20 runs every game. Senior players like myself couldn't be there till the back end. We couldn't get enough runs, that makes it very difficult to win games. This season goes down to the batters. Unfortunately, we didn't perform well enough. It's been a tough season for us. There's a lot of investment that we can do on certain players. There's a lot of players, two players that played today, that impressed us. We are a very proud franchise. It's just 20 runs here and there. We'll refocus for the next season and make one or two small changes to the squad.\n\nCalvin Savage | Most Valuable Player: (On his batting) That was a lot of good fun. I have put in a lot of hard work and it's nice to see come to fruition and then getting a bit of form at the right time. It's been a great experience. (Walking at 99/5) I tried to keep it pretty simple, target opportunities that I felt suited me and not look for too much on what didn't suit me. I used to overthink everything a lot, I just stayed positive, not too reckless, play my game and it's starting to pay off. (Bowling) I was lucky I got to bowl after the powerplay, that helps a little bit. Keep it wicket-to-wicket, take pace off and use the longer boundary to my advantage. It was a good wicket to bat on, I enjoyed it. With the slower ball, it does stay in the wicket a little bit. Seam-up came on really well. I felt like we were a smidge above-par, maybe on par, didn't think we were well above-par. (On tomorrow's game vs MINY) Got to try my best doing the same thing.\n\nAlbie Morkel | TSK's Assistant Coach: Very good so far. We had quite a bit of rain in North Carolina. That stopped our tournament a little bit. Happy with the last few performances. Today, a few new guys got opportunities and some nice performances there. Very happy with the tournament so far. Tough to get the guys up for games like these. We really want to do well, it was a good exercise today to come out and play with high intensity and see a few others guy perform, so that was good. It's a quick turnaround time, tomorrow against Mumbai, hopefully we can repeat that. (On Savage) He struggled last year with a few injuries. He's looked a lot fitter this year. His batting has improved a hell of a lot since last year. He's playing that No. 7 role perfectly for us and tonight, his first opportunity with the ball, very happy for him.\n\n23:15 Local Time, 04:15 GMT, 09:45 IST: Seattle Orcas end their disappointing campaign with another loss - fifth on the bounce and sixth this season. Chasing 178, they lost in-form Rickelton off the very first ball. Although de Kock and Jayasuriya stitched a fifty partnership, the asking rate was constantly increasing and both the batters were dismissed by Savage. Noor trapped Bracewell lbw with a googly and Santner accounted for Klaasen which saw the Orcas getting reduced to 67/5. Keemo Paul struck three boundaries but he was cleaned up Noor who finished with impressive figures of 4-0-19-2. Earlier, captain Faf got his team off to a flier but Texas stuttered to 99/5. That's when Savage walked in and played a gem of a knock - 27-ball 45* - to take his team to a total that he reckoned was above-par. A clinical win for TSK heading into the playoffs.\n\n19.6\n\nStoinis to Nandre Burger, 1 run, slower ball, a miscued heave to long-on follows. Texas win by 37 runs\n\n19.5\n\nStoinis to Ayan Desai, 1 run, slower delivery, full in length, driven firmly to extra cover for a quick single\n\n19.4\n\nStoinis to Ayan Desai, FOUR, 130.1kph, shuffles across a long way and manages to put bat on ball. He was looking to scoop it fine but makes good contact against this low full toss and the ball goes square of the man at 45\n\n19.4\n\nStoinis to Ayan Desai, wide, away-angling length that's too wide outside off, left alone\n\n19.3\n\nStoinis to Ayan Desai, no run, off-speed yorker outside off and Ayan Desai can only squeeze it back to the bowler\n\n19.2\n\nStoinis to Ayan Desai, no run, full delivery, Ayan Desai walks across a long way to scoop and gets hit on the pad outside the line of off-stump\n\n19.1\n\nStoinis to Nandre Burger, 1 run, 130.3kph, yorker, Burger squirts it onto his pad off the toe-end and the batters nab a single. Conway runs in and fails to hit the stumps with an underarm throw and Ayan Desai survives\n\nMarcus Stoinis [2.0-0-17-0] is back into the attack\n\n18.6\n\nOttneil Baartman to Ayan Desai, no run, bouncer to end the over, Ayan Desai crouches to pull and misses\n\nAyan Desai, left handed bat, comes to the crease\n\n18.5\n\nOttneil Baartman to Ali Sheikh, out Caught by Stoinis!! Another one bites the dust! Ali Sheikh goes after this short ball with a pull shot. Hurriedly plays it and top-edges it to deep backward square leg where Stoinis takes another catch. Ali Sheikh c Stoinis b Ottneil Baartman 15(9) [4s-2]"
