        "date": "",
        "body": "Bangladesh's star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan is expected to return to the country on Thursday, a source confirmed to a online sport news portal on Tuesday.\n\nHis return comes ahead of Bangladesh's two-match Test series against South Africa, scheduled to begin soon in Mirpur. Reports suggest that Shakib plans to retire from Test cricket after the first Test of the series.\n\nShakib left Bangladesh on July 2 to participate in the Major League Cricket (MLC) for Los Angeles Knight Riders in the United States. Since his departure, significant events have unfolded, including political shifts in the country. On August 5, the Sheikh Hasina government was ousted following anti-discrimination student protests, which resulted in Shakib losing his position as a Member of Parliament. Additionally, a murder case was filed against him, which led to his extended stay abroad.\n\nDespite the legal controversies, Shakib continued to represent Bangladesh in tours to Pakistan and India while living overseas. There had been speculation about whether Shakib would return to play the upcoming Test series at home, as he sought assurances for his safe exit from the country after the matches.\n\nHowever, Asif Mahmud, an advisor to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, confirmed that there are no barriers to Shakib's return to Bangladesh. With this assurance, Shakib has initiated his return process and is expected to arrive this Thursday.\n\nIn other developments, Phil Simmons, Bangladesh's new interim coach, is set to arrive tomorrow (October 16) following the suspension of former head coach Chandika Hathurusingha."
