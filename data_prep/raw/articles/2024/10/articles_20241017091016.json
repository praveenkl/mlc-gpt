While there remains some element of uncertainty over Rishabh Pant's future with the team, it is confirmed that Hemang Badani will take charge as head coach for the upcoming two seasons. Additionally, Badani's former India teammate, Venugopal Rao, will serve as the team's director of cricket.\n\nThe two, who have long played together for MRF in the Chennai league, are known for their strong association and professional understanding, and the Delhi Capitals management has granted them the freedom to select the rest of the coaching staff. Replacing the likes of Ricky Ponting, who served as the franchise's head coach for the past seven years may not be easy but the management has apparently made a conscious decision to not go for big names. Venugopal (42) played 16 ODIs and represented three sides, including Delhi Capitals. Badani (47) represented India in four Tests and 40 ODIs.\n\nBoth Venugopal and Badani have been involved with the franchise's subsidiaries elsewhere - mainly in the ILT20 in UAE and Major League Cricket (MLC) in the US. Incidentally, both those sides - Dubai Capitals and Seattle Orcas - are owned by Delhi Capitals co-owner Kiran Kumar Grandhi of the GMR Group. The JSW group is the other co-owner of the Delhi side and as reported previously, the GMR group currently holds the reins of the franchise management that alternates between the partners every two years.\n\nAs for Pant, whose midnight post on October 12 sparked a wave of curiosity in IPL circles, he is understood to be set to continue with the team. Currently occupied with a Test assignment, the management is refraining from disturbing him, but they expect him to confirm his commitment after the series. For the record, the franchise has time until October 31 to announce their player retentions.\n\nMeanwhile, a major talking point in the IPL is that several players, some big names at that, are opting not to be retained, choosing instead to test their market value in the auction. They are emboldened by the new Right to Match (RTM) rule, which allows the highest bidder one final chance to lift their bid to the amount of their choice before the RTM is exercised. Although the new clause has faced opposition from some franchises, it has empowered player agents - especially those representing foreign players - to start negotiations with teams for better deals. While a new franchise may not always secure the player, the auction can drive up the player's value to the desired amount. Some player managers, it is learnt, have opened up back channel discussions for their clients.\n\nThis website has reported that either a Saudi city or Singapore could potentially be chosen as the venue for the IPL auction. Now, it is also heard that Vienna is being considered. The auction is expected to take place by the end of November, and the franchises want the venue to be announced soon so they can begin travel arrangements for their delegations.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet"

This will be the last Test match for the veteran Shakib, who will retire from red-ball cricket.\n\nThere were doubts regarding Shakib Al Hasan's participation in the upcoming series Vs South Africa. He left for USA in July 2024 to play in Major League Cricket, and since then a lot has changed in the country.\n\nA ploitical turmoil took place as the Sheikh Hasina government fell amidst student protests, and the then Prime Minister fled the country, resulting in Shakib losing his parliamentary seat. Moreover, there has been a murder case filed against the Bangladesh all-rounder and as a result, he decided not to return to Bangladesh.\n\nHowever, Bangladesh's Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Mahmud Sajib Bhuiyan confirmed that there's no obstacle for Shakib's return and the champion batter should return back safely.\n\nShakib will join the team practice session on Friday as the Tigers aim to inflict a series defeat on the Proteas team.\n\nNo major changes in Bangladesh squad\n\nNo major changes have taken place from the last Test series Vs India. Najmul Hossain Shanto will lead the team, and the core of the squad remains the same. The only change they've made is the exclusion of pace bowler Khaled Ahmed, and barring that the squad remains the same.\n\nOn home pitches, the team looks good on paper, with a nice balance of pace and spin bowling.\n\nBangladesh squad for first Test Vs South Africa",
        "summary": "* Shakib Al Hasan, a Bangladesh cricket player, left for the USA in July 2024 to participate in the Major League Cricket tournament.\n* There is no further information about the Major League Cricket tournament in the article beyond Shakib's participation.\n\nNote: The majority of the article focuses on Shakib's return to the Bangladesh team for a Test series against South Africa, and not on the Major League Cricket tournament. Therefore, there is limited information available to summarize."
