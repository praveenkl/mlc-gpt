In a thrilling encounter at the MiLC tournament on August 30, 2024, the Manhattan Yorkers edged out the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers by a margin of 10 runs. The eagerly anticipated match saw both teams jostling for supremacy at the crease.

The Manhattan Yorkers took to the field first with the bat but faced a determined Cavaliers bowling attack. Prannav Chettipalayam and Danesh Patel opened the innings, but Patel was soon back to the pavilion after an unfortunate lbw dismissal by Syed Najaf Shah at just 8 runs. Chettipalayam managed to scrape together 15 runs before succumbing to a catch by S Kazmi off the bowling of Adnan Haroon. The Yorkers struggled initially, with Yasir Mohammad run out for just 6 runs and others like Siddarth Kappa not significantly adding to the scoreboard.

However, the innings saw a semblance of stability with Nirmith Shashidhar, who put up a commendable performance by scoring 41 off 33 balls, including five boundaries and a six. His resilience proved crucial in setting a competitive target. Late contributions from Jaykishan Parwani, who chipped in with 14 runs, and some brief but effective hitting by Manoj Acharya and Preet Shah, pushed the Yorkers to a total of 119 runs at the end of their allotted 20 overs. The Cavaliers bowlers, particularly Syed Najaf Shah and Adnan Haroon, played a vital role in containing the Yorkers, both bagging two wickets each.

In response, the Cavaliers faced a challenging target of 120. Chandrapaul Hemraj and Syed Abdullah started their chase but found the Yorkers' bowling attack too formidable to handle. While Hemraj hit an early six, he was eventually trapped lbw by Ruchir Joshi for 11 runs. Abdullah's stay was more prolonged, scoring a slow 14 runs off 32 balls, but he too fell victim to Yasir Mohammad's clever bowling, caught by D Patel.

Gajanand Singh and Muhammad Usman Saeed tried to stabilize the innings, but both were dismissed by the ruthless Yorkers. Junaid Nadir Mahsood provided some late fireworks with a rapid 25 off 16 balls, featuring three towering sixes, but it was insufficient to tip the scales in favor of the Cavaliers. The Yorkers bowlers shared the wickets among them, with Manoj Acharya and Ruchir Joshi each grabbing two crucial scalps. Special mention goes to Nimish Bachu, whose tight spell saw him take two wickets for just 1 run in his two overs.

The Cavaliers ended their innings at 109 runs for the loss of 9 wickets, falling short of the needed target. Thus, the Manhattan Yorkers secured a hard-fought victory by 10 runs in a match that was a battle of nerves and skills rather than sheer force and aggression, marking another thrilling chapter in the MiLC tournament.
