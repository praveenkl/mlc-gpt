In an exciting contest at the Minor League Cricket tournament, the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers secured a commanding victory over NYC Titans by 78 runs using the Duckworth-Lewis method. 

The match commenced with New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers taking to the crease where they assembled a formidable score of 159 runs in 16 overs. Chandrapaul Hemraj set an aggressive tone with a quickfire 28 off 18 balls before being caught by A. Algoo off Keshav Raval. Although Saad Bin Zafar fell soon after reaching only 6 runs, Kennar Kevon Lewis steered the innings with a solid 56 runs off 43 deliveries, including five boundaries and four sixes. Gajanand Singh was instrumental in propelling the score with his explosive 57 from just 27 balls, smacking three fours and six sixes. The Cavaliers' high-scoring efforts were aided by extras conceded by the Titans, totaling 8 wides.

NYC Titans’ bowlers struggled for breakthroughs, as Keshav Raval was the only one who managed to claim wickets, dismissing Hemraj and Zafar, finishing with figures of 3 overs, 30 runs, and 2 wickets. Despite economical spells from a few, the Cavaliers' relentless and strategic batting carried them to a daunting total, hastened by rain interruptions which reduced the innings to 16 overs per side.

Faced with a considerable target, the NYC Titans’ batting lineup faltered against a penetrating Somerset Cavaliers' bowling attack. Syed Najaf Shah was particularly lethal, capturing 3 wickets for just 8 runs in his 3-over spell. Equally damaging was Gajanand Singh, whose all-round performance shone brightly under pressure, claiming 3 wickets for 19 runs. Despite the best efforts from Aashish Katipally, who contributed 30 runs off 29 balls with three boundaries and two sixes, the Titans’ batsmen were subdued. 

Their innings closed at 85 for 9 wickets in 16 overs, falling significantly short of the required total. Gajanand Singh, with his impactful all-round display, supported by strategic spells from Shah and rest of the Cavaliers’ bowling unit, effectively stalled the Titans' chase. The decisive bowling, complemented by sharp fielding, ensured that the Cavaliers maintained control throughout the innings.

Ultimately, the match was curtailed and recalculated under the Duckworth-Lewis method due to weather interruptions, awarding the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers a notable victory by a 78-run margin. This win marked a significant statement from the Cavaliers as they dominated with both bat and ball, underscoring their formidable presence in the tournament.
