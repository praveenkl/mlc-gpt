The match between the Chicago Kingsmen and the Baltimore Royals unfolded in the super 8 stage of the Minor League Cricket on October 3, 2024, with the Chicago Kingsmen securing a well-fought victory by 18 runs. This encounter showcased some impressive performances, particularly in the Kingsmen ranks.

Batting first, the Chicago Kingsmen put up a challenging total of 195 for the loss of 5 wickets in their allotted 20 overs. The innings was anchored by Tajinder Singh, who scored a brisk 66 runs off just 40 deliveries, hitting four boundaries and three towering sixes. He played a pivotal role in building the innings after the early departure of Rameez Raja and Syed Faraz Ali, who were dismissed for 13 and 3 runs respectively. Alongside Singh, Hassan Khan also shone with the bat, striking a quickfire 50 from 21 balls, laced with six boundaries and three sixes, which propelled the Kingsmen to a formidable score.

On the bowling front for the Baltimore Royals, Jaskaran Singh Buttar emerged as the most successful bowler with figures of 4-0-46-2. However, he was somewhat expensive, alongside Mohammad Mohsin, who also went for runs despite picking up a wicket. The ability to contain runs escaped them, with Sarbjeet Ladda delivering the most economical spell by conceding only 20 runs in his 3 overs without taking a wicket.

In response, the Baltimore Royals faltered in their chase despite some notable knocks. Sharad Lumba provided a brisk start with 24 runs off 11 balls, including four boundaries and one six, but his dismissal set the Royals on the back foot. Subsequent innings by Ravi Inder Singh Mehra scoring 32 off 23 balls, and a resilient 42 from Rishi Ramesh couldn’t stabilize the innings sufficiently. The standout for the Royals was Mohammad Mohsin, who hit a late salvo of 46 from just 19 deliveries, featuring five fours and three sixes, offering a glimmer of hope for Baltimore but ultimately left too much to chase when he fell in the dying overs.

The Kingsmen bowlers delivered a concerted team effort, with each contributing towards derailing the Baltimore chase. Ehsan Adil was effective, picking up two key wickets, and Haseeb Azam mirrored that success with a similar 2 for 26 from his three overs. Additionally, Anwar Ali Khan and Tajinder Singh chipped in with crucial wickets at vital junctures of the match, helping to restrict the opposition and seal the match in the concluding overs.

Despite a spirited effort by the Royals, the Kingsmen’s disciplined bowling attack coupled with a strategic batting performance ensured their ascent on the points table, making the most of the runs on board and concluding the exciting match with an 18-run victory.
