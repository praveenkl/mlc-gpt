Winning the toss, the Silicon Valley Strikers opted to bat first and set up a formidable total of 175 runs on the scoreboard for the loss of 5 wickets in their 20 overs. The innings were spearheaded by Shehan Jayasuriya, who played a pivotal role by scoring a brisk 49 runs off just 29 balls, embellished with 3 fours and 4 towering sixes. He was well-supported by Kamran Hotak, who crafted a steady 44 from 40 balls, hitting 4 boundaries and a six. The opening partnership laid a strong foundation before Jayasuriya was clean-bowled by Vatsal Vaghela, who emerged as the most successful bowler for the Grizzlies, claiming three crucial wickets for 32 runs in his four overs.

The Strikers' middle-order batsmen chipped in with useful contributions, with Anthony Bramble adding 21 off 17 deliveries and Adit Gorawara providing late impetus with a 15-run cameo off just 9 balls.

Chasing a daunting target of 176, the Golden State Grizzlies faced immediate setbacks, losing their opener Rahul Jariwala for just 5 runs, caught by wicketkeeper Anthony Bramble off Ishwarjot Sohi's bowling. Sohi’s superb spell of 4 wickets for 24 runs dismantled the top order of the Grizzlies, including the crucial wickets of Kranthi Chintapalli for 2 runs and Manav Nayak after a fighting 27-run knock. The Grizzlies seemed to regain ground through Sahil Garg’s patient knock of 31 off 35 deliveries and Mohit Nataraj’s explosive 32 from 13 balls, but the pressure of mounting required run rate and consistent strikes from the Strikers’ bowlers kept them in check.

Faisal Khan Ahmadzai further escalated the troubles for the Grizzlies with figures of 4 wickets for just 10 runs in his 4-over spell. Along with Saurabh Netravalkar, who took 2 for 12, the Strikers' bowling attack managed to bowl out the Grizzlies for just 114 runs in their allotted 20 overs.
