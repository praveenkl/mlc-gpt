In a thrilling contest at the Super 8 of the Minor League Cricket 2024, the Seattle Thunderbolts emerged victorious over the New Jersey Stallions by five wickets.

New Jersey Stallions, having batted first, managed a total of 142 runs in their 20 overs. The highlight of the innings was a stellar knock of 71 runs from Dominique Rikhi, who faced 50 balls, hitting seven boundaries and a six. His performance was crucial as wickets fell around him. The next best contribution came from Supreet Madaan, who scored 22 off 18 balls. Despite the promising start by Rikhi, the rest of the batting lineup struggled against a disciplined Thunderbolts' bowling attack. Atif Attarwala was the pick of the bowlers for Seattle, taking three key wickets for just 22 runs in his four overs and derailing the Stallions' innings. Kairav Sharma, Sujit Nayak, and Shivam Sharma chipped in with a wicket each, ensuring the Stallions could not capitalize on their beginning.

Chasing 143 to win, the Seattle Thunderbolts found themselves under pressure early, losing Ian Chauhan for 23 and Abinav Sudershanum shortly for just 5, both falling within the first few overs. Nonetheless, it was Sujit Nayak who turned the game on its head with a scintillating innings of 78 from just 36 balls. Nayak's innings was sprinkled with five fours and five sixes, demonstrating power and precision. His aggressive batting was pivotal as it kept the Thunderbolts ahead of the required rate and left the Stallions disoriented in the field. While wickets continued to fall at the other end, Nayak’s heroics ensured that the game was well within their grasp.

Anirudh Immanuel gave the Stallions a glimmer of hope, picking up three wickets in his spell of two and a half overs, but it was not enough to stem the flow of runs. With strong support from Shivam Sharma, who contributed a useful 20 runs, Seattle managed to reach the target with 39 balls to spare, finishing on 143 for 5 in 13.3 overs.

The New Jersey Stallions bowler Stephen Wiig took one wicket and bowled a fairly economical spell, despite the challenge faced from an aggressive Nayak. In the end, the Thunderbolts' ability to strike at a high rate and build partnerships around Nayak's innings proved decisive. The win by five wickets was a testament to Seattle’s skills in both bowling to restrict and batting to chase efficiently. This victory solidified Thunderbolts’ position as strong contenders in the Super 8 stage of the tournament.
