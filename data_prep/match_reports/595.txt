Ryan Scott provided a robust start with a dynamic 40 runs off just 27 deliveries, peppered with three fours and three maximums.

The Cavaliers' bowlers, led by Vraj Tarak Desai, kept a tight grip on the innings. Desai, in particular, was impressive, returning figures of 2 for 24 in his four-over spell. Saad Bin Zafar also chipped in with a wicket, maintaining pressure throughout his four overs.

Chasing a target of 146, the Somerset Cavaliers got off to a brisk start, thanks to an explosive innings by Kennar Kevon Lewis.

Bhaskar Yadram was a highlight in the bowling attack for The Philadelphians, taking 2 wickets for 25 runs in his full quota of four overs.
