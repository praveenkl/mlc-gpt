The season promises an exhilarating lineup of matches featuring some of the world’s best international players and the nation’s top domestic talent.\n\nBuilding on the momentum of its inaugural 2023 season, Cognizant Major League Cricket has extended the tournament due to demand with an extra six league matches. The four-game playoff series, to be hosted in Grand Prairie, TX, is set to captivate cricket fans across the globe.\n\nThe 2024 season will commence with two matches across the country on July 5th, headlined by MLC’s reigning champions, MI New York, featuring their elite West Indian batter Kieron Pollard, who will face off against 2023 runners-up Seattle Orcas headlined by star South African pair Wayne Parnell and Quinton de Kock, at Church Street Park in Morrisville at 3:30 PM EDT.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings, spearheaded by classy South African Faf du Plessis, will take on West Indian off-spinner Sunil Narine’s LA Knight Riders at the purpose-built Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, TX at 7:30 PM CDT.\n\nThe opening weekend also features the Australian-stacked Washington Freedom featuring Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, and coach Ricky Ponting, facing MI New York on Saturday, July 6, at 3:00 pm EDT. The San Francisco Unicorns, bolstered by hard-hitting opening New Zealand batter Finn Allen, will host the LA Knight Riders on Sunday night at Grand Prairie Stadium, TX, at 7:30 PM CDT.\n\nCognizant Major League Cricket’s CEO, Vijay Srinivasan can't wait to see the passion and enthusiasm come to life with cricket fans across the country for the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\n\"We are incredibly excited to unveil the schedule for the 2024 season,\" said Srinivasan.\n\n\"This promises to be our most thrilling season yet, with each of the MLC’s six teams actively recruiting in the off-season, adding a host of world-class player signings to their team rosters with more big names to be soon announced.\n\n“With some of world cricket’s biggest current stars and seasoned veterans involved, including the likes of athletic Jamaican allrounder Andre Russell, New Zealand’s left-arm quick, Trent Boult, 2023 MLC Finals MVP Nicholas Pooran, Afghanistan's superstar spinner, Rashid Khan, together with cricketing royalty in coaches Ricky Ponting, Shane Watson and Stephen Fleming, it demonstrates the depth of talent being attracted to the league.”\n\nIn addition to the highly anticipated matches, MLC remains committed to supporting the long-term infrastructure to foster the growth of localized cricket communities and strengthen cricket’s presence in the US.\n\n“Last year, we unveiled MLC at the newly upgraded Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, and the brand new Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, which will both once again co-host the 2024 tournament, building on the impact of season one in those communities,” Srinivasan said.\n\n“These venues will deliver world-class pitches and a vibrant atmosphere to support the overall MLC fan experience. Moreover, we are committed to exploring expansion opportunities with new cricket venues to support our six teams’ growing American fanbase.”\n\nOff the back of Major League Cricket’s first successful season and a momentum boost from the ICC T20 World Cup in the U.S. in June - the 2024 season is primed to reach new heights with cricket fever to captivate the US this summer.\n\nTickets for all matches will go on sale in the coming weeks and can be purchased through the official Major League Cricket website. Fans are encouraged to secure their tickets early by registering for the pre-sale to ensure they don't miss out on the action after sell-out crowds in 2023.\n\nFor more information about Major League Cricket and to view the full schedule for the 2024 season, please visit www.majorleaguecricket.com\n\nENDS"
