        "date": "Thu May  2 08:37:39 2024",
        "body": "We were worried that during Season 1, people wouldn’t come. Obviously, we have a very big fanbase existing in the U.S.A., first generation, second generation, Indians, Australians, West Indians. And I was also looking to bring in new people, but the advantage is we already have that existing fanbase.\n\nSo, to see a full house and people waving their flags and chanting, I think it blew us away. I was also happy to see new people. I thought this was a party and what a mashup this is; this is great.\n\nWhat were some challenges and opportunities encountered during this edition of MCL?\n\nJustin Geale: I think our challenge moving forward is to be proud of our association with India but also Americanize the game a bit to bring in new people, so we are going to have samosas and also, we are going to have hot dogs.\n\nIt’s about how we blend these worlds together. It’s a unique challenge we have compared to the rest of the world, but the commercial opportunity involved here is massive. And obviously, the recognition of the brands Texas Super Kings, MRD York, Los Angeles Knight Riders, you have to see the advantage because it’s a novel factor, so our challenge is also to share that with America.\n\nWe are really pleasantly surprised; we have a lot more work to do, and let’s not kid ourselves. But sponsors like Royal and Cognizant are a huge part of that because they allow us to get that credibility; they are established brands and they can fast track the league.\n\nComing to you Abhinav, tell us about your experience of the first season and first-time partnership with Major League Cricket last year?\n\nAbhinav Arora: Being an official sponsor of the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) season was a true honor for Royal. We’re excited to extend our partnership into its second year, connecting cricket fans in the United States to South Asia’s rich culture and unique cuisines.\n\n…And what are your goals for the upcoming season?\n\nAbhinav Arora: As we begin this new season, our goal is to expand on last year’s success by enhancing the cricketing experience. During the inaugural season, Royal had unveiled its new ad spot, showcasing how Royal brings authentic taste that complements the thrill of every cricket game and celebrates the many flavors of cricket and the many flavors it brings out in fans.\n\nThe one-minute ad showcased the fusion of tradition, cuisine, and cricket, emphasizing the diverse traditions and flavors that make cricket an essential component of South Asian culture.\n\nThe great comments from spectators who appreciated our Sampling done at the cricket ground, Royal® basmati rice with numerous toppings, reinforces the relationship between Royal and MLC supporters. Fans at the stadium were treated to a complimentary ‘Build Your Own Bowl’ game day snack.\n\nWe’re eager to introduce cricket fans to new innovations and our refreshed brand identity this year, continuing to elevate their experience both on and off the field.\n\nJustin, which are the brands that have partnered with Major League Cricket for this edition?\n\nJustin Geale: This year, we’ve already secured Cognizant as our title sponsor, and we’re fortunate to have Royal returning from last year. They understand the landscape, the market’s scope, having been involved before us. Utilizing their expertise is crucial for us.\n\nWe’ve secured stake from another sponsor this year, meaning we now have three sponsors with significant experience, both nationally and internationally. This adds to our credibility because they have confidence in the market and the process. It’s truly a partnership, and given the risks involved, their trust is invaluable.\n\nFor years, we’ve pondered what strategies will succeed, and it’s challenging to prove that. These sponsors showed courage by being among the first to join us, and we greatly appreciate their support and the close relationship we’ve built with them.\n\nAbhinav, tell us about the what are the opportunities this partnership presents for Royal LT Foods Americas?\n\nAbhinav Arora: At LT Foods, we are overjoyed to have reached a significant milestone in our collaboration with MLC. During the first season in the United States, they played an important role in promoting cricket culture. The combination of South Asian cuisine and this exciting sport has really lit up the atmosphere.\n\nWith Royal’s ongoing support in Season 2, we’re preparing to reach even more people and strengthen our position as North America’s go-to brand for Basmati rice and Sona Masoori rice. We’re excited to broaden our reach like never before by collaborating with Royal’s die-hard fans and cricket fanatics.\n\nWe’re delighted to showcase our new brand logo and packaging to a varied audience of sports fans in the North American market as part of our continued relationship with MLC, which will open opportunities for growth and brand recognition.\n\nSpeaking of synergies, what kind of activations or marketing initiatives can we expect to see from Royal (LT America Foods) during the tournament?\n\nAbhinav Arora: Right from the opening night, fans can immerse themselves in giveaways, contests, and the electric atmosphere of Major League Cricket matches.\n\nWhat makes this season truly special is the opportunity for fans to experience the authentic flavors of South Asia while watching spectacular matches. This blend of exciting games and Royal’s delectable cuisine provides fans with a true sense of South Asia.\n\nAt Royal, our aim is to create unforgettable moments both on and off the field, enhancing our visibility and appeal to a wide audience of food and sports enthusiasts.\n\nOur sponsorship of the MLC’s top run scorer title is a testament to our commitment to supporting cricket at its highest level. The already thrilling season is about to get even more exciting as the top hitters in the world compete for this coveted prize!\n\nWe share the values of quality, history, and community that cricket and Royal represent. We hope that by hosting this event and collaborating in general, we can naturally integrate our brand into the cricketing community.\n\nHow is Major League Cricket tackling the challenge of introducing cricket as a new sport category in a country where it isn’t prevalent?\n\nJustin Geale: I think there’s an awareness of it, but it’s like that game that goes for five days, and like, no, this (MCL) is T20, it lasts for three hours.\n\nThe most comparable thing we have is baseball, I guess. That’s a bat and ball sport. And I love baseball too, not as much as cricket, but it’s quite slow. I mean, the game goes on for three hours, and it might end 3-1. You might see one or two home runs.\n\nSo we’re playing in a field that’s 400 meters wide. There might be 40 home runs, so there might be that many Sixers. There are no foul balls. You can hit the ball 360, and every ball is an event.\n\nHow are you maximizing the partnerships with teams such as the Super Kings, LA Knight Riders, and MI? What key elements have motivated the collaboration between these franchises, particularly highlighting the market expansion, continuous engagement throughout the year, and commercial prospects in the USA?\n\nJustin Geale: It’s a learning experience for everyone involved. I believe these franchises have joined because they recognize the market’s growth. Cricket is divided into various formats like SAT 20 and IT 20, each with its own team brands. This arrangement allows for year-round engagement.\n\nThere are significant commercial opportunities, especially when considering the synergies involved. For instance, LA Knight Righters could facilitate connections between Bollywood and Hollywood, envision Shahrukh Khan’s involvement. New York’s influence in finance offers additional advantages.\n\nThis expansion provides sponsors with enhanced exposure in a large and lucrative market. While I have an appreciation for Australia and the UK, the scale of the USA’s market and its embrace of capitalism offer unparalleled potential. Overall, this venture enables brands to tap into new audiences and opportunities.\n\nWhy should brands partner with MLC? What’s in it for them?\n\nJustin Geale: I believe the time is ripe for cricket in the USA. We’ve made significant progress in the past 25 years, and the upcoming India-Pakistan game will garner global attention. With cricket entering the Olympics in 2028, there are immense opportunities for growth, including government funding and increased competitiveness. Infrastructure development is underway, and hosting international matches will boost commercial prospects.\n\nI think one of the strongest things we can do is to build awareness and recognition for brands, to get consideration, to convert these consumers. So, we’re giving exposure because we’re only going with a very small number of sponsors.\n\nWe’re placing a strong emphasis on quality. It’s not merely about displaying a logo; it’s about implementing effective activation strategies. This includes sampling and delving into the brand’s narrative and heritage. Given their extensive presence, not just in India but also in America, we’re seriously considering their longstanding experience.\n\nSponsoring cricket in the USA targets affluent demographics, influencing policy and creating new market opportunities. This shift from niche to mainstream appeal presents sponsors with a unique chance to capitalize on a growing fanbase.\n\nHow is Royal leveraging digital and social media through the cricket league to reach wider audiences?\n\nAbhinav Arora: We’ll use social media to communicate with cricket fans, publishing engaging and entertaining content that integrates our brand message with their enthusiasm for the game.\n\nWe had seen good engagement around Season 1 content like ‘A very Royal XI’ contest where fans could build their own team and win MLC tickets and a signed cricket ball by players, thrilling ‘Choose Your Bowler Bracket,’ which engaged fans by inviting them to cast their votes for their favorite cricket players and meals.\n\nWe are committed to building strong relationships with cricket fans through our recipes, behind-the-scenes glimpses at cricket events, and engaging competitions.\n\nFinally, we want to be more than just a rice brand.\n\nHow do you plan to optimize distribution channels to ensure that your content reaches key markets effectively, considering both traditional television networks and digital platforms?\n\nJustin Geale: That’s an excellent question, and it’s a challenging one indeed due to the time zone misalignment, which we’re acutely aware of. However, our franchises are deeply committed to the American market.\n\nIn terms of the American market, Willow TV holds significant importance for us. We’re actively engaging with numerous RSNs, which encompass regional sports networks hosting events such as the NFL and MLB, along with local teams.\n\nFor instance, in my location in Chicago, RSNs are pivotal for accessing sports content. Similarly, in key markets like New York, Seattle, and LA, we’re striving to establish our presence.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the importance of traditional television platforms in reaching wider audiences, we recognize that digital platforms hold immense growth potential. Drawing insights from the growth observed in India with events like the IPL and World Cups, we believe digital platforms offer significant opportunities for engaging with Indian audiences.\n\nOur focus extends beyond the core action of the game; it encompasses the surrounding content such as morning highlights packages and other supplementary materials. This comprehensive approach enables us to effectively leverage and package sponsorship opportunities.\n\nHow do these collaborations fit into the broader landscape of sports sponsorship?\n\nJustin Geale: We do aim to bring about some disruption in cricket. As a startup based in Silicon Valley ourselves, we recognize the business potential of these already massive Indian brands. The question becomes: how do we consolidate these brands and leverage their power effectively?\n\nCollaboration is key. Building a successful league is not just beneficial for the teams involved but also for our sponsors. Ultimately, the success of the league hinges on the quality of cricket. It cannot be mere gimmickry. That’s why we prioritize having top-notch pitches and recruiting the best players globally, aside from Indian players.\n\nThis year, our lineup is exceptionally strong, allowing us to showcase cricket at its finest. This commitment to excellence ensures that newcomers perceive the sport as serious.\n\nHow will the ICC T20 World Cup being hosted in the USA boost cricket in the country?\n\nJustin Geale: We must capitalize on this opportunity by catering to our existing cricket fans while also making the sport more accessible to newcomers, thus expanding its appeal to everyone. This strategic approach is essential because both the ICC and other nations recognize the potential of cricket in the USA, evident in the expedited hosting of the World Cup.\n\nHow will MLC’s efforts to promote and propagate cricket in America contribute to local infrastructure and development needs, such as enhancing facilities and providing training at school and high school levels?\n\nJustin Geale: You’ve hit the nail on the head with that observation. Schools play a pivotal role here. When you examine the sports infrastructure in American colleges and high schools, it’s truly astounding. Our long-term strategy involves integrating cricket more extensively into the sporting landscape, thereby creating opportunities for scholarships.\n\nCurrently, aspiring athletes are more inclined towards sports like golf, tennis, or baseball, as they offer pathways to scholarships and eventual professional careers. However, as we continue to expand the game, particularly through initiatives like MLC, we’re providing a viable career option in cricket.\n\nThere’s tremendous potential for women’s cricket in this regard. If we consider sports like softball, which boasts exceptional hand-eye coordination skills, there’s a missed opportunity post-college as there’s no professional league. By introducing cricket early on, we offer an alternative career path. Imagine the prospects of traveling the world and playing in franchise cricket leagues."
