        "body": "The fifth edition of the Lanka Premier League is set to be played from July 1 to July 21, which means the tournament will clash with Major League Cricket and the Hundred. That created the fear of failing to attract more foreign talents to the shore.\n\nAccording to a Sri Lanka Cricket release, the first round will have 20 matches, while the final round will have four matches, including Qualifier 1 & Qualifier 2 and the Eliminator. Each team will consist of a minimum of 20 players and a maximum of 24 players, with six overseas players.\n\nLast year also, the tournament clashed with Major League Cricket and the Hundred, but thanks to the local flavour it has, the tournament has gained wide popularity among fans.\n\nWhile Jaffna won the first three seasons of the tournament, B-Love Kandy won the 2023 LPL."

He was part of the Aussie contingent at this year's Major League Cricket tournament, taking five wickets in two games for the Washington Freedom.\n\nHis experience will be invaluable for a Scorchers squad full of emerging talent with Cooper Connolly, Mahli Beardman and Sam Fanning all penning new deals with the side.\n\nTye it was an \"incredible exciting\" time for the Scorchers and named Beardman and Connolly as the players to watch coming through the ranks.\n\n\"The Scorchers have been an enormous part of my cricketing journey, so l'm thrilled to be sticking around for another year,\" he said.\n\n\"On a personal note, I feel my own game is in good shape and the hunger is certainly there, as it is with the rest of the squad.

Now coming into his ninth season with the club, he's a Sydney Sixer through and through.\"\n\nIn another one-year deal as clubs fill out their lists, Melbourne Stars have thrown pace bowler Brody Couch a lifeline re-signing the Victorian for the season.\n\nThe pace bowler showed promise in his first year with the Stars, playing every game in BBL|10, taking 16 wickets at an average of 22.06 but has since struggled for opportunities at the top level.\n\nThe Stars have overlooked Couch for more experienced pace bowlers such as Joel Paris, Scott Bland and Luke Wood.\n\nHis search for more game time in white ball cricket has led Couch to make the move to Western Australia, signing for the state's one day side, while the US passport holder had a stint at the San Francisco Unicorns in the MLC this winter.\n\nThe 24-year-old will be hopeful his recent performances will be enough to regain his place in the Stars lineup after only managing two appearances since his breakout season.\n\nContracted for BBL|14: Scott Boland, Hilton Cartwright, Brody Couch, Tom Curran (England), Ben Duckett (England), Sam Harper, Campbell Kellaway, Glenn Maxwell, Hamish McKenzie, Usama Mir (Pakistan), Joel Paris, Tom Rogers, Mark Steketee, Marcus Stoinis, Doug Warren, Beau Webster\n\nIns: Tom Curran (Sixers), Hamish McKenzie (Scorchers), Ben Duckett (England), Doug Warren\n\nOuts: Nick Larkin (retired)\n\nBBL|14 Draft selections: Ben Duckett, Tom Curran (pre-signed), Usama Mir\n\nOut of contract: Joe Burns, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Corey Rocchiccioli\n\n\"Having the opportunity to play in the US this winter has been a great experience which has helped me to continue to improve my skills,\" said Couch.\n\n\"I've learnt a lot over the last three years with the Stars, I love playing in the Big Bash and hopefully I can help contribute to the team in BBLI14.\"\n\nThe Stars will start their BBL|14 campaign against the Scorchers over in the west on December 15 and the Sixers will take on the Melbourne Renegades on December 16 at home."

        "date": "Wed Jul 24 05:46:05 2024",
        "body": "Dallas [Texas]: Led by Calvin Savage's all-round performance, the Texas Super Kings handed the Seattle Orcas a comprehensive 37-run defeat in the final league match of the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, on Tuesday.\n\nDespite Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya giving the Orcas a solid start in their run chase the Texas Super Kings' bowlers, led by Ottneil Bartmann (3/20), Noor Ahmad (2/19) and Calvin Savage (2/23), dismantled the Seattle batting lineup.\n\nWith the conclusion of the match, Seattle Orcas finish their campaign with six losses and a sole victory, whereas the Texas Super Kings, who secured three wins and two losses (two no results) will play MI New York in the eliminator.\n\nMirroring the first innings, the Seattle Orcas' run chase of 178 runs, lost Ryan Rickleton (0) off the first ball of the innings to Ottneil Bartman. Shehan Jayasuriya (24 in 27 balls, with three fours and a six) joined Quinton de Kock (26 in 19 balls, with two fours and a six), and the pair took control of the run chase. At the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 47/1.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya eventually fell to Calvin Savage in the seventh over after a 27-ball stint at the crease. Not long after, the dangerous Quinton de Kock was also dismissed, leaving the Orcas at 59/3 in the ninth over.\n\nAlso Read: https://www.thehawk.in/posts/snoop-dogg-named-one-of-the-final-torchbearers-at-paris-olympics\n\nFaced with a steep equation, the onus was on Heinrich Klaasen (4) and Matthew Bracewell (4) to steer the innings. However, both batters were outfoxed by spinners and dismissed for single digits. Mitchell Santner saw the back of Klaasen, while Bracewell was trapped by Noor Ahmad.\n\nComing together with the score at 67/5 in 10.4 overs, Shubham Ranjane (16) and Keemo Paul (25 in 17 balls, with three fours) labored to keep the Orcas in contention. However, Ranjane was run out and Keemo Paul was castled by Noor Ahmad before the 17th over, comprehensively extinguishing the run chase. Ali Sheikh chipped in with a consolatory knock, but the Orcas fell well short, finishing at 140/9.Otneill Bartman took two wickets in the tail to finish with figures of 3/20.\n\nEarlier in the day. The Texas Super Kings lost openers Devon Conway (0) and Joshua Tromp (6) early in the innings, however, Faf Du Plessis (39 in 17 balls) was in fine form, smashing six boundaries and a six before he was scalped by Keemo Paul. At the end of the power play the Texas Super Kings were placed at 56/3.\n\nMilind Kumar (29 in 28 balls, with two sixes) played a watchful knock, scoring nearly a run-a-ball before he became Keemo Paul's second wicket of the day. The experienced all-rounders, Marcus Stoinis (11) and Mitchell Santner (15) both got starts, but failed to convert them into bigger scores, falling to Aryan Desai and Matthew Bracewell, respectively.\n\nCalvin Savage (45* in 27 balls, with six fours and two sixes) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson, the pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings. Stevenson (17) struck a four and six to support Savage's late innings fireworks, but was cleaned by Nandre Burger in the 18th overs.\n\nSavage hammered Bracewell for two consecutive maximums in the 16th over and went on to script a 17 run over of Nande Burger's 18th over to remain unbeaten and help the Texas Super Kings finish at 177/8.\n\nBrief Scores\n\nTexas Super Kings 177/8 (Faf Du Plessis 39 off 17, Colin Savage 45* off 27, Keemo Paul 2/18, Ayan Desai 2/30) beat Seattle Orcas 140/9 (Quinton de Kock 26 off 19, Keemo Paul 25 off 17, Ottneil Bartman 3/20, Noor Ahmad 2/19 ) by 37 runs.\n\n—ANI"
