        "body": "21-year-old Rushil Ugarkar has made quite the name for himself in recent times. Bowling against the likes of Hanuma Vihari in the nets in the NCA at just 17 years old revealed that he was not as quick as he would have liked to be. However, many years after that, he has made his way into the MLC (Major League Cricket).\n\nPlaying for MI New York in the MLC, Ugarkar managed to regularly clock in speeds of early 130s in the two games he featured for his side in the season. It is worth noting that the youngster had been suffering from food poisoning in the lead up to the tournament and was eight pounds lighter when he made his MLC debut.\n\nHowever, overcoming his issues, the bowler managed to deliver a brilliant spell. He recently came forward and reflected on his experience of playing franchise cricket.\n\nAlso Read: 'He was so approachable, supported me a lot' - USA's Saurabh Netravalkar recalls playing under Yuvraj Singh's captaincy [Exclusive]\n\nUgarkar made his way into MI New York after he was drafted in as the franchise’s rookie pick. Making his way into the side, the 21-year-old found himself in the company of the biggest bowlers in world cricket like Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and Anrich Nortje.\n\nHe talked about how former Sri Lanka cricketer Lasith Malinga helped him find his way, and working with him was the highlight of his time with MI New York (MINY).\n\n“Working with Malinga was probably the highlight. Out of all, I think he had taught me so many things which I didn't know much about cricket. We worked with the video analyst as well. There were so many match-ups that they had ready. So for someone like Faf, he likes to step out a lot. He kind of goes straight towards you. So I was asked to bowl at the wide line if I saw him step out. So if he slashes, it would balloon to the fielder placed there. Or even a slower ball,” Ugarkar was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz."

        "body": "In the recent past, Rushil Ugarkar, age 21, has become quite well-known. Even at the age of 17, he was not as quick as he would have liked to be when he bowled in the NCA nets against players like Hanuma Vihari. But many years later, he’s managed to get into Major League Cricket, or MLC.\n\nUgarkar, who played for MI New York in the MLC, frequently reached early 130s in the two games he played for his team that season. It’s important to remember that the young athlete was eight pounds lighter when he made his MLC debut and had been experiencing food poisoning in the days before the competition.\n\nNevertheless, the bowler overcame his problems to produce an outstanding spell. He recently opened out about his thoughts on his time spent playing cricket for a franchise.\n\nRushil Ugarkar entered MI New York following his selection as the team’s rookie pick in the draft.\n\nAs the 21-year-old made his way into the team, he was surrounded by some of the best bowlers in the world, including Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and Anrich Nortje.\n\nHe discussed how working with Lasith Malinga, a former cricket player for Sri Lanka, helped him find his path and how it was the high point of his tenure with MI New York (MINY).\n\nProbably the best part was working with Malinga. I believe that he had taught me a great deal about cricket, about which I knew very nothing. We also collaborated with the video analyser. They have an incredible amount of matchups prepared. He therefore enjoys going out frequently for someone like Faf. He kind of moves in your direction. I was instructed to bowl at the wide line in case I witnessed him leaving. He would therefore inflate to the fielder positioned there if he slashed. or even a slower ball,” according to a quotation from Ugarkar.\n\nAlso Read: MLC 2024: Pat Cummins and the San Francisco Unicorns agree to a four-year contract\n\nAt the Ebenezer school in Bengaluru, Ugarkar was bench mates with Sanjay Krishnamurthy of the USA when he was younger. He was not successful in India, so he left the BCCI age group tournaments and moved to the USA with Krishnamurthy. He is currently attempting to succeed in the 2024 Minor League Cricket season."
