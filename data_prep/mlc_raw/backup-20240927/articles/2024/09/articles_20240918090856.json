        "body": "England cricket legend Jimmy Anderson is being lined up for a £135,000 deal to play in the USA's Major League Cricket tournament.\n\nAnderson retired from international cricket following the first Test against West Indies at Lord's in July. He finished his Test career with 704 wickets to become his country's all-time leading wicket-taker.\n\nThe 42-year-old has since taken on a coaching role with England, becoming a mentor to their pace bowlers. But it now appears that he remains keen to continue his career at club level.\n\nTeams in the MLC look set to be the most interested following the completion of its second season. Australia captain Pat Cummins is the league's highest-profile player, with the bowler having a contract with the San Francisco Unicorns until 2027.\n\nHis countrymen Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head meanwhile all play for Washington Freedom, who won the MLC this year. Anderson is now closing in on joining them in the States next season.\n\nAccording to BBC Sport, senior figures with at least one MLC team are growing interested in signing Anderson. They are now exploring whether the England legend would be interested in making the move.\n\nIt is expected he could earn around £135,000 by featuring for a short stint in the MLC. The league has influential backers including Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Should Jimmy Anderson join an MLC club? Comment below.\n\nThey have pursued some of the game's biggest names, with England World Cup winners Liam Plunkett and Jason Roy having both taken part in the past two versions of MLC. Roy gave up an ECB white-ball contract worth up to £70,000 to sign a two-year deal with the Los Angeles Knight Riders worth £300,000.\n\nThe league is set to expand to 34 games next year having been granted official List A status in May. Anderson has made it clear he would be open to playing franchise cricket, despite his last competitive T20 match coming back in 2014.\n\n\"There might be people behind the scenes chatting to people,\" he recently told the Tailenders podcast. \"I have not played white-ball cricket for a while so that is the first thing I need to get back to if I am to think about doing it. I don't know if there is any interest so I will just ask around.\"\n\nAnderson remains on a central contract with the ECB until the end of September. Last week, he confirmed he would remain on England's backroom staff for the Test series against Pakistan in October and is planning to join the side for their tour of New Zealand in December.\n\n\"At the minute, I'm due to go to Pakistan and New Zealand in the winter,\" he told Sky Sport. \"Then nothing concrete after that. I'm very new to this, I'm still learning as we go.\n\n\"It's partly me trying to figure out if this is where I want to go with the next stage of my career and also for them to figure out if I'm any good at it.\""

        "body": "Former England National Cricket Team pacer James Anderson is on the radar of one of the unnamed franchises of Major League Cricket (MLC). As per the reports in BBC Sports, it is learned that the top officials of the team want him to play in the next edition of the league.\n\nThis comes after James Anderson expressed his interest in playing in white-ball cricket, especially T20 leagues, after calling time on his international career with the England National Cricket Team. He mentioned that he hasn't played franchise cricket and would want to have a taste of it.\n\nAlthough he didn't make the decision official, he hinted about the same, saying that with the way white-ball swings, he feels he has a job to do. But the premier pacer also was aware of the fact that he would be facing challenges as well.\n\nWith Anderson hinting about playing franchise cricket, the MLC franchise owners are exploring whether the 42-year-old fast-bowling legend would be interested in participating in the growing T20 tournament in the United States.\n\nThe reports claim that if James Anderson signs a deal in the Major League Cricket, he could earn around 1,35,000 euros for a short stint in the competition. It is also learned that Major League Cricket is set to expand from 19 to 34 games in 2025.\n\nAnderson played his last T20 match in 2014 for Lancashire in the T20 Blast. Since then he prioritized Test cricket and ended his career as the best fast bowler in the history of the longest format of the game. If he returns to T20 cricket again, it would be a massive challenge for him to adjust, especially with how the game has evolved.\n\nIf Anderson joins Major League Cricket, he will be playing alongside the likes of Australia captain Pat Cummins and stars like Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head. Apart from them, his English teammates Liam Plunkett and Jason Roy have already featured in previous editions, with Roy signing a lucrative two-year deal worth 3,00,000 euros with the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nJames Anderson ended his Test career after playing the first Test against the West Indies\n\nJames Anderson ended his Test career after playing the first Test against the West Indies National Cricket Team earlier this year in June. The veteran pacer ended up as one of the best players to have played for the England National Cricket Team in the longest format of the game.\n\nIn 188 games, Anderson picked up 704 wickets and ended as the leading wicket-taker in terms of fast bowlers in Test cricket. Overall, he ended his career as the third-highest wicket-taker in the Tests and also played the second-most number of games in the format.\n\nSince retiring, James Anderson has served as the mentor of the England Test team. He also will be serving the same role during the team's tour to Pakistan and New Zealand in the upcoming few months."

        "body": "GMR Group expands its cricket portfolio\n\nThe acquisition significantly expands GMR Group's cricket portfolio, which already has teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), UAE's ILT20, and USA's Major League Cricket. As part of the deal, GMR would control several assets including the Utilita Bowl, a Hilton hotel, and an 18-hole golf course near the Hampshire cricket ground. This strategic move further solidifies their position in global cricket management.\n\nECB's call for overseas investment in The Hundred\n\nEarlier this year, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) invited overseas investors to get a stake in The Hundred. Following this invitation, 18 counties were approached for privatization. However, only Hampshire have successfully secured a deal so far. Other IPL franchises such as Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Lucknow Super Giants, and Rajasthan Royals are also reportedly in discussions with other counties.\n\nPotential format change for The Hundred\n\nIn another development, the ECB has initiated discussions about potentially changing the format of The Hundred, England's 100-ball competition. Despite its four-year history, the 100-ball matches have not been as successful as anticipated. While there are no plans to alter the competition's branding, it could be transformed into T20 matches in the future. This potential change is being considered in light of increased interest from IPL franchises in owning teams within The Hundred."

        "date": "Mon Sep 16 10:49:59 2024",
        "body": "James Anderson, the legendary pacer of England cricket, is making headlines once again as he potentially targets a spot in the burgeoning Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States. This speculation follows Anderson’s recent retirement from international cricket, wherein he claimed an impressive 704 Test wickets, marking the end of an era in the sport. At 42 years old, Anderson seems eager to explore the white-ball formats, hinting that his cricketing journey is far from over.\n\nAnderson, who officially hung up his boots in July 2024, has been a linchpin of English cricket for nearly two decades. His retirement has left a significant gap in the Test arena, but reports suggest that he could be lured back into the game through the fast-developing MLC.\n\nInterest from Major League Cricket Teams\n\nAccording to a report from BBC Sport, at least one MLC franchise is keenly pursuing the veteran bowler. This interest comes as Anderson expresses optimism about a potential return to white-ball cricket, particularly for the third edition of this exciting T20 tournament set to take place in 2025. With the MLC hailing impressive stature just two years since its launch, attracting notable internationals like Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, and Glenn Maxwell, the league has already begun to cement its credibility in the global cricket scene.\n\nThe MLC will expand to a remarkable 34 games in 2025 and has gained official List A status, enhancing its profile further. As a result, Anderson’s potential involvement could position him favorably within this rapidly growing league.\n\nFinancial Incentives and Career Rejuvenation\n\nThe prospect of engaging in the MLC offers enticing financial benefits for Anderson. Reports indicate that a stint in the league could yield earnings of approximately 135,000 euros for a brief tenure. This figure significantly overshadows the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) white-ball contract, which was recently valued at 70,000 euros—making the MLC increasingly appealing for cricketers looking to maximize their earnings while still enjoying the game.\n\nDespite not having played competitive T20 cricket since 2014, Anderson remains confident about his capabilities. He believes his physical fitness and skill set are sufficient to compete effectively in the fast-paced format. Meanwhile, since retirement, he has taken on a coaching role as the England men’s bowling consultant, preparing for forthcoming tours of Pakistan and New Zealand in the winter.\n\nReflections and Future Plans\n\nDuring an interview with Sky Sports, Anderson shared his insights on his new role: “At the minute, I’m due to go to Pakistan and New Zealand in the winter. Then nothing concrete after that.” He expressed his commitment to navigating this new chapter of his career: “I’m very new to this, I’m still learning as we go. It’s partly me trying to figure out if this is where I want to go with the next stage of my career and also for them to figure out if I’m any good at it as well.”\n\nHollywood Stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney Interested in Buying Stake in The Hundred Franchise Welsh Fire\n\nThe dual roles of coach and potential player in the MLC underscore Anderson’s multifaceted contributions to the sport, illustrating his desire to remain active within the cricketing world while also fostering the next generation of talent."

        "date": "Tue Sep 17 13:52:26 2024",
        "body": "Perhaps James Anderson, England’s most successful Test bowler, could stage a sensational return to T20 cricket. With 704 Test wickets in an illustrious career, Anderson recently became a fast-bowling coach for England’s support staff. But recent reports indicate that he might return to T20 cricket this time, probably from Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States. So, let’s see what this means.\n\nJames Anderson’s Excellent Statistics\n\nJim Anderson resigned from international cricket with a fantastic Test career behind his name, and now he has been shortlisted for a role in Major League Cricket’s 2025 season. The interest of white-ball cricket in Jim Anderson has caught the attention of franchises belonging to MLC. As the league is expanding heavily, adding more international stars on board, Anderson is a great addition to such a roster.\n\nStill, Anderson’s Test record is nothing short of extraordinary. He assumes the impressive mantle of being England’s all-time leading wicket-taker in Tests with 704. He continues to adapt his bowling to varying conditions, which ensured that he was and still is given a very long run. But in the past year or so, Anderson has spoken more on test cricket than anything else, with his last game in T20 cricket going as far back as 2014.\n\nThe Ambitious Plans of MLC\n\nMajor League Cricket has been in the news for wanting world-class cricketers. Such big tickets have already attracted some star players to the league, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella-backed league, which has managed to attract notable cricketers like Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head. Anderson’s possible addition would further fill up the reputation of such a league.\n\nHe would be handsomely paid somewhere around Rs 1.49 crore (approximately 135,000 euros) for his tenure with the MLC. It is big money for franchises that shift their focus on experienced players who have the skills with star power. For him, it is a good chance to produce some virtues in another format of the game and his cricketing career.\n\nTen years may have elapsed since Anderson played T20 cricket, but he is not uncertain that he will play T20 cricket with a lot of success in this format. His last T20 game was for Lancashire in the T20 Blast back in 2014, but he maintains that his skills and experiences will be quite relevant to T20 cricket. This comes through the careful approach to bowling and fitness regimes.\n\nMLC Expansions and the Future\n\nFrom 19 games in the MLC, it has expanded to 34 games in the year 2025, giving ample testimony to how much the league has grown and aspires to be ambitious. Of course, it’s just the right opportunity for players like Anderson to feature meaningfully. A league that can have players like the current England international no doubt has the makings to be one of the giants in international cricket.\n\nA comeback to T20 would constitute an interesting chapter to the already illustrious career of Anderson. He could savor the challenge in a different format and also top up on his fame as one of the game’s greats. Being in the MLC will also inspire young cricketers and gain more attention for the league.\n\nA return for James Anderson in T20 cricket in the form of MLC would be something cricket fans would certainly welcome. Setting aside his focus on Test cricket, any possible involvement in the MLC is proof of his never-ending talent, and he can be versatile with the different roles that he will be called upon to perform. As the MLC grows, Anderson’s participation will be pivotal in further shaping its future and further cementing his place in cricketing history.\n\nFor More Great Content\n\nAre you desiring top-tier content that covers everything?
