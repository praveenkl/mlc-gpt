        "text": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) tournament in the US has secured investment from the CEO of Microsoft and the owners of four teams from the Indian Premier League. The league has already attracted top players such as Jason Roy, Sunil Narine, and Pat Cummins, who have chosen to play in America over England. The MLC's financial backing has made it a threat to English cricket, as it can offer higher wages to top players. The league is expected to expand next year, with more matches that may clash with the English season. There are also rumors that the US could host an additional season of the Indian Premier League, which would draw even more top players away from England. The success of the T20 World Cup has fast-tracked the expansion of MLC, which could potentially undermine the English summer cricket season."
