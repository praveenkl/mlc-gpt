        "date": "Sat Jun 29 08:51:00 2024",
        "body": "New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham has been drafted by Leicester for the rest of the T20 blast campaign as the South African Wiaan Mulder has opted for Major League Cricket (MLC) over the T20 blast. The 26-year-old will be featured in the MLC throughout July. Leicester have made a solid move by picking Neesham as they have an important final six T20 North Group matches.\n\nNeesham became a household name after his performance for New Zealand in the memorable 2019 World Cup performance, with the Kiwis losing to England in the Final on boundary counts. Leicester are in search of their fourth title after a hiatus of 13 years. They currently sit third on the points table. Talking about Neesham, the all-rounder performed well in the T20 World Cup 2024 as other batters struggled with their form.\n\nAlso Read: 'Virat Kohli will score 100' - Monty Panesar predicts ahead of India-South Africa final at Barbados\n\n“Jimmy brings immense international pedigree and adds perfect balance to our side at a crucial point of our campaign,” said director of cricket Claude Henderson as quoted by BBC Sport.\n\n\"The team is going really well, so I’m excited to help the guys push for a quarter-final spot. The fans are really passionate. It’s a lively atmosphere I’ve experienced first-hand. I’m looking forward to having them on my side this time,” said Neesham on his appointment.\n\nNeesham holds a lot of experience playing for English cricket\n\nThe T20 blast appointment is not new to Neesham as the right-handed pacer has already featured in English T20 cricket before. He has played for Derbyshire in 2016, Kent in 2017, Essex in 2021 and Northants in 2022. He has appeared twice in the Hundred league, having played for Welsh Fire in 2022 and then Oval Invincibles in 2023. His match-winning 57 not out in 33 balls at Lord's adds to his prowess with the bat."
