Viswanathan,[18] publicly announced their team name – the Texas Super Kings, logo and coach for the first time.[19] However, it was announced in late April that they had revamped their logo for it to look similar to the logos of the Chennai and Joburg Super Kings.[20]\n\n2023 season[edit]\n\nPrior to the launch of the official season, it was announced the MLC's inaugural domestic draft would take place on March 19, 2023.[21] The Super Kings had the final pick of the first round draft and selected Rusty Theron,[22] before adding Sami Aslam, Calvin Savage, and Milind Kumar with later selections.[23] In June 2023, the Super Kings announced seven of their nine overseas signings, including Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, and Dwayne Bravo. In addition, they announced their full support staff lineup, including Albie Morkel and Eric Simons, among others.[24] They subsequently announced that former South African skipper, Faf du Plessis, would captain the side[11] and on July 5, selected Mohammad Mohsin as their Domestic Wildcard Pick.[25]\n\nRayudu withdrew from the tournament following the Board of Control of Cricket in India's proposal of a year-long \"cooling-off period\" for recently retired players[26] and his place taken by Imran Tahir.[27]\n\nIn the opening match of the tournament on July 13, the Super Kings recorded a 69-run win over the Los Angeles Knight Riders.[28][29] This was followed by a 6-run defeat to the Washington Freedom in their second match,[30][31] a 17-run victory over MI New York[32] and an 8-wicket defeat to the Seattle Orcas.[33][34]\n\nA three-wicket win over the San Francisco Unicorns ensured a top-two finish going into the playoffs,[35] but losses to both Seattle and New York saw the team eliminated.[36][37]\n\n2024 season[edit]\n\nAhead of the start of the 2024 season on July 5,[38][39] on February 15, 2024, the Super Kings released a list of retentions for overseas players, including captain Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner.[40][41] During the domestic players' draft, the Texas Super Kings selected Joshua Tromp and Raj Nannan.[42][43] Outside of the draft, the team announced a series of overseas signings from New Zealander Daryl Mitchell to Australian Marcus Stoinis.[44][45] Mitchell however, following an injury, was ruled out of the season and was replaced by Afghan cricketer Noor Ahmad.[46]\n\nCurrent squad[edit]\n\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\n\nTexas Super Kings roster Position Name Nationality Date of birth (age) Batting style Bowling style Year signed Notes Batters Faf du Plessis South Africa (1984-07-13) July 13, 1984 (age 39) Right-handed Right-arm leg-break 2023 Direct signing, captain Milind Kumar United States (1991-02-15) February 15, 1991 (age 33) Right-handed Right-arm off-break 2023 Saiteja Mukkamalla United States (2004-04-09) April 9, 2004 (age 20) Right-handed Right-arm off-break 2023 U23 player All-rounders Calvin Savage United States (1993-01-04) January 4, 1993 (age 31) Right-handed Right-arm fast 2023 Zia Shahzad Pakistan (1996-06-18) June 18, 1996 (age 28) Right-handed Right-arm legbreak 2023 Dwayne Bravo West Indies (1983-10-07) October 7, 1983 (age 40) Right-handed Right-arm medium fast 2023 Direct signing Mitchell Santner New Zealand (1992-02-05) February 5, 1992 (age 32) Left-handed Slow left-arm orthodox 2023 Direct signing Marcus Stoinis Australia (1989-08-16) August 16, 1989 (age 34) Right-handed Right-arm medium fast 2024 Direct signing Aiden Markram South Africa (1994-10-04) October 4, 1994 (age 29) Right-handed Right arm off-break 2024 Direct signing Aaron Hardie Australia (1999-01-07) January 7, 1999 (age 25) Right-handed Right arm medium-fast 2024 Direct signing Cameron Stevenson United States (1992-10-30) October 30, 1992 (age 31) Right-handed Right arm fast-medium 2023 Raj Nannan West Indies (1994-09-14) September 14, 1994 (age 29) Left-handed Slow Left arm Orthodox 2024 Daryl Mitchell New Zealand (1991-05-20) May 20, 1991 (age 33) Right-handed Right-arm medium 2024 Ruled out due to injury Wicket-keepers Devon Conway New Zealand (1991-07-08) July 8, 1991 (age 32) Left-handed Right-arm medium 2023 Direct signing Joshua Tromp United States (2005-04-01) April 1, 2005 (age 19) Right-handed Right arm medium 2024 Drafted Bowlers Mohammad Mohsin Pakistan (1996-04-15) April 15, 1996 (age 28) Left-handed Left-arm leg break googly 2023 Domestic Wildcard Pick Zia-ul-Haq Pakistan (1994-12-11) December 11, 1994 (age 29) Right-handed Left-arm fast-medium 2023 Naveen-ul-Haq Afghanistan (1999-09-23) September 23, 1999 (age 24) Right-handed Right-arm medium-fast 2024\n\nDirect Signing\n\nNoor Ahmad Afghanistan (2005-01-03) January 3, 2005 (age 19) Right-handed Left-arm unorthodox 2024\n\nDirect Signing\n\nAdministration and support staff[edit]\n\nTexas Super Kings staff[47] Position Name Head coach Stephen Fleming Assistant coach Eric Simons Assistant coach Albie Morkel Team manager Russell Radhakrishnan Strength and conditioning Greg King High performance analyst Lakshmi Narayanan Physiotherapist Tommy Simsek\n\nPerformance[edit]\n\nStandings[edit]\n\nYear League standing Final standing 2023 Second Semifinals\n\nC: champions\n\nRU: runner-up\n\nSF team qualified for the semi-final stage of the competition\n\nSeason summary[edit]\n\nYear Played Wins Losses Tied/NR[a] 2023 7 3 4 0 Source: ESPNCricinfo[48]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nChennai Super Kings\n\nJoburg Super Kings\n\nReferences[edit]"

Team USA's vice-captain Aaron Jones was among three domestic players selected to play in the upcoming second MLC season, which begins on July 5.\n\nFollowing the mammoth interest in the T20 World Cup and America's success, three Cognizant Major League Cricket teams--Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, and Seattle Orcas--had a roster place available, providing the opportunity for undrafted domestic players to secure a place on a team roster in the upcoming tournament.\n\nThe draft order was randomly determined on 18 June, and teams were given 48 hours to strategize and finalize any internal discussions before the supplementary draft occurred.\n\nThe following domestic supplementary draft picks were made:\n\nLA Knight Riders - Chaitanya Bishnoi\n\nA top-order batsman and spin bowler, the 29-year-old played for the Chennai Super Kings championship side in 2018 before moving to the United States to pursue his cricket in early 2023. He was a part of the San Francisco Unicorns squad in the 2023 inaugural season of Major League Cricket, featuring in all five matches for the Bay Area side. He was also a key member of the Dallas Xforia Giants during the 2023 edition of Minor League Cricket.\n\nSeattle Orcas - Aaron Jones\n\nJones returns to a familiar dressing room, having played for the Orcas in last year's inaugural Major League Cricket season. The top-order batsman has been a cornerstone of Team USA's success during the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Jones has made headlines throughout Team USA's historic World Cup campaign and was part of the USA's momentous defeat over Pakistan in Texas. Orcas fans will be hoping for similar performances throughout MLC.\n\nMI New York - Sunny Patel\n\nA right-handed middle order batsman and leg spin bowler, Sunny Patel left his mark on the 2023 Minor League Cricket season. His contributions with both bat and ball played a crucial role in the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers advancing to the Championship match, where they lost to the Dallas Mustangs. Patel also provides some variety to the domestic player brigade of MI New York, being the only domestic leg-spinner on their roster heading into the 2024 season,\n\n\"Major League Cricket plays a critical role in developing domestic players and providing a pathway to play cricket at the highest level amongst some of the best players in the world. We are thrilled to welcome Chaitanya, Aaron, and Sunny to the 2024 MLC season, adding three more talented domestic players to our league,\" said Major League Cricket Tournament Director, Justin Geale as per a MLC release.\n\nThe second season of MLC commences July 5, with reigning champions MI New York taking on Seattle Orcas at Morrisville, NC, followed by Texas Super Kings vs LA Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium, TX. After sell-out crowds in the inaugural season, fans are encouraged to purchase their tickets early to ensure they don't miss out on the action this season. In addition to the world-class matches, fans have several ticket options, with general admission tickets starting at $30 per person.\n\nThe season's excitement extends beyond the pitch, with entertainment, fireworks, free giveaways, player signings and meet-and-greets, merchandise giveaways, food trucks, and samples throughout the tournament.
