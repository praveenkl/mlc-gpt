        "body": "US cricket is rising. After beating Pakistan and pushing India, the Americans have reached the last eight of the T20 World Cup. On Sunday, they play England.\n\nThe success comes at a time of vast growth for American cricket. The US, the co-host of the tournament, launched a professional league last year and added T20 cricket to the 2028 Olympics in LA.\n\nLong regarded as an oxymoron, cricket in America is being powered by serious financial backers. Its domestic championship, Major League Cricket, has secured investment from the CEO of Microsoft and the owners of four teams from the Indian Premier League, cricket’s sporting and commercial behemoth.\n\nAmerican cricket might only be emerging, but it is already a threat to the game in England. The US league clashes with the English season, and many stars – English and foreign – are choosing to play in America over Albion.\n\nLast year, World Cup winner Jason Roy exchanged his England contract for one in Major League Cricket. Sunil Narine, Surrey’s star overseas player, missed T20 Finals Day because he was playing for the LA Knight Riders. This month Pat Cummins, the captain of the Australian teams that won the One-Day World Cup and the World Test Championship, signed a four-year contract with the San Francisco Unicorns. Jos Buttler, the England One-Day and T20 captain, is also interested.\n\nThe worry for English cricket is that, financially, it won’t keep pace. The English teams, almost all owned centrally or by members, could struggle to match the wages Major League Cricket can offer the world’s best players. The pound, which has still not recovered from Brexit, remains weak against the dollar.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) currently has full control of the English summer, which allows it to manage players’ workloads and make strategic decisions to bolster the England team. But if cricket in the US flourishes, the ECB will almost certainly be forced to take private investment (probably from India) to keep salaries competitive. Such a financial model would imperil English cricket’s foundations.\n\nAmerican cricket has a lot of work to do, especially in infrastructure. The 34,000 seater stadium on Long Island (bigger than any ground in England) is only temporary, and its wicket and outfield were dreadful. And yet, as I queued for the shuttle after South Africa versus Netherlands, the Yanks in front of me – newcomers to this queer sport – were trying to buy more tickets.\n\nMainstream US culture is slowly catching on. The World Cup has been covered by the major TV networks and newspapers (even if the New York Times, rather unconventionally, reported that India had beaten Pakistan 119-113). There was even a note of congratulation to the US team issued by the White House.\n\nCricket won’t quite conquer the US – the country is too big, and the sports market too flooded – but it doesn’t need to sweep all aside to be a success. To undermine the English summer, cricket in the US only has to succeed in certain pockets of the country, among certain demographics. The South Asian diaspora in the US stands at over five million. That’s roughly equal to the total population of a major cricketing nation like New Zealand, and not far short of the countries in the West Indies.\n\nMajor League Cricket will include more matches next year, increasing the conflict with the English season. American cricket’s ties to India have brought rumours that the US could host an additional season of the Indian Premier League every year. That would draw even more of the world’s best players (including English ones) away from both domestic and international matches held in England.\n\nThe success of the T20 World Cup has fast-tracked this expansion. On Sunday, England and the US will compete in the last eight. After that, they’ll compete to control summer cricket."

        "date": "Sat Jun 22 15:23:50 2024",
        "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) has completed its Domestic Supplementary Draft, filling the remaining roster spots for the upcoming season. Team USA’s Aaron Jones, Chaitanya Bishnoi, and Sunny Patel were the three lucky players selected. The draft comes after a successful inaugural MLC season and on the heels of Team USA’s impressive performance in the ongoing T20 World Cup.\n\nJones Back with the Seattle Orcas\n\nTeam USA vice-captain Aaron Jones secured a familiar spot with the Seattle Orcas. Jones, a top-order batsman, was a key player for the Orcas in the inaugural MLC season. His recent heroics with Team USA in the T20 World Cup, including a crucial performance in the historic win over Pakistan, undoubtedly influenced the Orcas’ decision.\n\nFans in Seattle can expect more of the same high-octane batting displays from Jones throughout the upcoming MLC season.\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi Joins LA Knight Riders\n\nLA Knight Riders opted for Chaitanya Bishnoi, a 29-year-old top-order batsman and spin bowler. Bishnoi boasts an impressive cricketing background, having played for the Chennai Super Kings in the 2018 Indian Premier League (IPL) before moving to the United States in 2023.\n\nHe quickly made his mark on American cricket, featuring in all five matches for the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural MLC season and playing a pivotal role for the Dallas Xforia Giants in Minor League Cricket last year. Bishnoi’s versatility with both bat and ball promises to be an asset for the LA Knight Riders.\n\nMI New York Welcomes Sunny Patel\n\nRounding out the draft picks is Sunny Patel, who joins the MI New York roster. Patel, a right-handed middle-order batsman and leg-spinner, impressed in the 2023 Minor League Cricket season. His all-around performance was instrumental in leading the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers to the Championship match.\n\nPatel brings a unique skill set to MI New York, becoming their sole domestic leg-spinner for the upcoming season, adding variety to their bowling attack.\n\nEnthusiasm for Domestic Talent\n\nMajor League Cricket Tournament Director, Justin Geale, expressed his delight at the selection of these talented domestic players. “We are thrilled to welcome Chaitanya, Aaron, and Sunny to the 2024 MLC season,” Geale said in a press release. “Major League Cricket plays a critical role in developing domestic players and providing a pathway to play cricket at the highest level.”\n\nThe second season of MLC kicks off on July 5th with a doubleheader. Reigning champions MI New York will face the Seattle Orcas in Morrisville, North Carolina, followed by the Texas Super Kings taking on the LA Knight Riders in Grand Prairie, Texas. With sell-out crowds witnessed during the inaugural season, MLC is encouraging fans to secure their tickets early for the upcoming season. Ticket options cater to a wide range of budgets, with general admission starting at $30.\n\nThe excitement extends beyond the on-field action. Fans can expect a vibrant atmosphere with entertainment, fireworks, giveaways, player meet-and-greets, merchandise opportunities, food trucks, and more throughout the tournament. With the addition of these talented domestic players and a focus on fan engagement, the second season of Major League Cricket promises to be an exciting one."
