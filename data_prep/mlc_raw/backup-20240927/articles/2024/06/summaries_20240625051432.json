        "text": "* Major League Cricket, the domestic championship of the US, has secured investment from the CEO of Microsoft and owners of four teams from the Indian Premier League.\n* The league has already attracted top players, including Jason Roy, Sunil Narine, and Pat Cummins, who have chosen to play in America over England.\n* The financial backing of Major League Cricket is a threat to English cricket, as it can offer higher wages to the world's best players, potentially luring them away from the English season.\n* The league plans to increase the number of matches next year, which will clash with the English season, and there are rumors that the US could host an additional season of the Indian Premier League every year, drawing even more top players away from England.\n* The success of the US team in the T20 World Cup has fast-tracked the expansion of American cricket, and the growth of Major League Cricket is likely to continue, potentially undermining the English summer."
