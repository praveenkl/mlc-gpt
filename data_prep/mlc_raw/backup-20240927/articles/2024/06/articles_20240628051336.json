        "body": "Cheers and balls smacking against cricket bats will echo out of Church Street Park until Tuesday for the first-ever Major League Cricket tournament.\n\nMorrisville, a cricket hub, was selected as one of the two towns alongside Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, to host the inaugural season’s matches.\n\nThe excitement can be felt in the home of every cricket fan in the town, especially those who made it happen.\n\nThinking about Morrisville becoming an international hub for the sport gives Jana Chellaperumal “goosebumps.”\n\n“This is a dream come true,” he said. “This is a cricket tournament on a different level that the country has never seen yet.”\n\nChellaperumal is a former president of the Triangle Cricket League, which has about 60 teams and over 3,000 players in the area. The seed to get Major League Cricket and to put Morrisville on the map for the sport was planted about 10 years ago.\n\nThe town first hosted Minor League Cricket games in 2021, giving fans a taste of what would come.\n\n“Hundreds of volunteers worked on the ground,” Chellaperumal said. “So, here we are enjoying the fruit.”\n\nThe economic impact the Major League Cricket games will have on the town is yet to be determined, said Rose Cornelius, president of the town’s Chamber of Commerce. Still, over 3,000 people from around the country are expected to be in Church Street Park, at 5800 Cricket Pitch Way, for the games between six founding national teams.\n\nAfter the games were announced in early June, tickets sold fast, with five of the seven games sold out as of Friday morning.\n\nChurch Street Park was expanded for the games, getting more cricket pitch lanes, LED-lit practice pitches and nets, athlete seating, and safety nets. Food trucks will line the park, and CBS Sports and ESPN+ will stream the games in Morrisville and Texas, broadcasting them to thousands of fans.\n\nAn investment in Morrisville\n\n“We’ve gone from being a park to now a world-class cricket facility in eight years, which is amazing,” Town Councilman Steve Rao said.\n\nUSA Cricket started eyeing Morrisville years ago to make more investments in areas with a large fan base, Rao said. Nearly half (46%) of the residents in Morrisville are of Southeast Asian descent.\n\nBecause of its large fan base, the bat-and-ball game of cricket — involving two teams, a total of 22 players, and a 22-yard field with wickets at each end — has grown in popularity over the years.\n\nSimilar to baseball, one team will bat while the other is on the field during the game. The teams switch during the long inning. The batting team will try to score the runs while the bowling team will try to stop them by fielding the ball.\n\nTeams can score up to 200 points in the match, where the game’s object is to score more runs than your opponent in a certain amount of time. To score a run, players need to hit the ball with the cricket bat.\n\nMost young cricketers have only seen their favorite players on TV or social media, but the games in Morrisville have brought the stars to the town.\n\nTop players include Afghanistan T20 captain Rashid Khan, South African internationals Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and David Miller, West Indians Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, and Dwayne Bravo, and others from England, Australia, Zimbabwe, India and New Zealand.\n\nRussell, a Jamaican cricketer for the Los Angeles Knight Riders, said in an Instagram post he didn’t know “such lovely ground was in North Carolina.”\n\nThe cricket field in Morrisville is one of three International Cricket Council-accredited fields in the country, making it eligible for the T20 Cricket World Cup, a goal for Morrisville leaders.\n\n“We’re hoping that the ICC will choose us,” Mayor TJ Cawley said. “That would have 500 million people watching. We’re hoping that this league will continue to expand and in a couple years, it would be wonderful to have one of our own Major League teams.”\n\nThe town is home to the Minor League Cricket team, the Morrisville Raptors.\n\nHow to see Major League Cricket in Morrisville\n\nTickets for the matches on Monday and Tuesday are still available starting at $12, according to the Major League Cricket website.\n\nFriday night, the Seattle Orcas face off against the Texas Super Kings at 5:30 p.m."

        "body": "The Knight Riders Group (KRG), backed by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside actor Juhi Chawla and businessman Jay Mehta, is investing in a 10,000-capacity cricket stadium near Los Angeles.\n\nLocated at a 15-acre land parcel in Great Park, Irvine, Southern California, some 40 miles from downtown Los Angeles, the plan is driven by Major League Cricket (MLC). The org has revealed that an exclusive negotiating agreement with the city of Irvine to move forward with lease negotiations and design approvals has been approved. The investment in the stadium is likely to be in the range of $30 million, Variety understands.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nBollywood Superstar Shah Rukh Khan Teams With Hitmaker Rajkumar Hirani for 'Dunki'\n\nShane Warne, Australian Cricket Legend, Dies at 52\n\nBBC Studios Sets Content Deal With India's MX Player - Global Bulletin\n\nKRG are owners of the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the lucrative Indian Premier League cricket tournament and Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nThe stadium, which will have the capacity to be expanded, will be designed by architects HKS and will be home to MLC’s Southern California-based franchise, in the heart of one of the largest cricket-loving populations in the U.S., including an estimated 100,000 cricket fans with a further 200,000 more located in Los Angeles County. Two Minor League Cricket teams, the SoCal Lashings and Hollywood Master Blasters, along with local adult and youth leagues in the area provide a base of grassroots support for cricket in the region.\n\nThe stadium plans include state-of-the-art training facilities, locker rooms, luxury suites, dedicated parking, concessions, field lighting and an international-grade pitch to meet International Cricket Council (ICC) accreditation. There are two major events that the proposed stadium, if completed in time, could host – the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024, which will be co-hosted by the U.S. and the West Indies, and if cricket is included in the 2028 Olympic Games to be held in Los Angeles, which the ICC is bidding for. U.S.A Cricket is also expected to bid for future men’s and women’s World Cup tournaments.\n\n“Our investment in MLC in America is based on our belief in the exciting future of cricket in the U.S.A and is well aligned to our strategy of establishing Knight Riders as a global brand in T20 cricket,” said Khan, per an MLC press release. “Plans to build a world class cricket stadium in the greater Los Angeles area is exciting for us and MLC. This will no doubt have a transformational impact for cricket in one of the world’s most iconic metropolitan destinations.”\n\nSameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders, MLC, added: “Great Park’s position as a hub for community recreation and its array of first-class sports facilities makes it an ideal location for the addition of a venue serving the local cricket-loving community and the broader Greater Los Angeles region with major international cricket events set to take place there.”\n\nBest of Variety\n\nMolly Shannon's Memoir 'Hello Molly' Is Already an Instant Bestseller on Amazon\n\n2022 Primetime Emmys Awards Season Calendar: The Governors Balls are Back After Two Years\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney Plus in April 2022\n\nSign up for Variety’s Newsletter.

        "date": "Thu Jun 27 16:38:35 2024",
        "body": "The Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) board has announced the introduction of a new rule in the upcoming Lanka Premier League (LPL 2024), which brings in additional powerplay overs for the batting side.\n\nThe LPL 2024 season will span from July 1 to 21, clashing heavily with the Major League Cricket in the United States. The latter will feature more well-known international players; the LPL has generally failed to draw global talent despite the money on offer, but it is popular among local fans.\n\nThe tournament’s fifth season, the LPL 2024 will feature 20 league matches between five franchises, followed by three playoffs and a final. Each team will play each other twice during the league stage before four of the five teams advance to the playoffs.\n\nDambulla Sixers, a new club, is one of the teams. The Dambulla team’s ownership shift was announced earlier this month, after Sri Lanka Cricket was forced to cancel the previous franchise due to one of its co-owners, Tamim Rahman, being arrested by Sri Lanka authorities under the Prevention of Offences Related to Sports Act.\n\nWhat is the ‘Power Blast Overs’ rule in LPL 2024?\n\nThe Lanka Premier League organizers will introduce a new feature dubbed ‘Power Blast Overs’ to add more aggression and excitement to a specific portion of their league. The feature is intended to include a special powerplay in the latter part of both innings.\n\n“The Lanka Premier League 2024 will introduce an exciting new feature with the addition of a special power play towards the latter part of each innings. This innovation, named ‘Power Blast Overs,’ will provide each team with a two-overpower play during the 16th and 17th overs of their innings,” SLC said in a statement.\n\nThe newly introduced Power Blast Overs feature will be used in the 16th and 17th overs of each innings. During this phase, a team will be allowed to field only four fielders outside the 30-yard circle, rather than the typical five outside the first six overs.\n\n“This new power play will be in addition to the traditional power play that occurs during the first six overs of an inning. During the ‘Power Blast Overs,’ only four fielders will be allowed outside the circle, thus creating a more aggressive and thrilling phase of the game,” the statement added.\n\nOn the new feature, Tournament Director of the LPL 2024 Samantha Dodanwela said, “We decided to bring this innovation in order to create further excitement for the league, which is growing year by year. This new introduction is sure to generate a lot of excitement among the fans, and the teams will need to strategize effectively to make the most of this period.”"
