        "text": "* Australian Test captain Pat Cummins has signed a four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns in the MLC, a fledgling US T20 tournament.\n* The deal strengthens MLC as a T20 destination and is a significant signing, given Cummins' international commitments have prevented him from playing in the Big Bash League since 2018.\n* Cummins is attracted to the MLC due to its potential in the US market and the opportunities it presents for his life beyond cricket, leveraging the network and possibilities offered by the owners and Silicon Valley.\n* The MLC is set to take place from July 6 to 29 this year, with Cummins' availability next year uncertain due to a two-Test series in the West Indies in June and July.\n* Other high-profile Australian players, including Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head, have also signed with MLC teams, such as the Washington Freedom.\n* The MLC has gained List A status for its second season, making it an official T20 league with records counting towards official T20 statistics."
