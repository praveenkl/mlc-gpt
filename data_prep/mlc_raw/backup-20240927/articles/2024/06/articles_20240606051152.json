For those keeping score, this is the second mention of cricket in today's newsletter, which must be meaningful in some way. Industry types tell me that much of the latent commercial interest in the sport here in the U.S. is being energized by tech companies, which see it as a powerful way to recruit the many South Asians in tech fields to their firms.\n\nBen Sturner’s Leverage Agency did the deal for MI New York. Other Accenture domestic sponsorships include a recent NFL league sponsorship, as well as some PGA Tour and LPGA deals."

        "title": "Dallas dreams of cricket",
        "date": "Sun Jun  2 18:00:47 2024",
        "body": "Location. Weather. Facilities. People. In four words, you have the summary of why Texas has become the hub of cricket in America.\n\n“It’s not even a question,” says USA player and Texas resident Andries Gous. “It’s 100% Texas. Whether it’s tournaments, games, camps or whatever it is that’s being held - it’s in Texas.”\n\nGous himself was born and raised in South Africa but joined the many players from around the world who moved to the USA with the advent of Major League Cricket. At first he lived in Seattle before making the move to the Lone Star State, and in particular, to Dallas.\n\n“I definitely moved for the stadium,” says Gous, talking about Dallas’s Grand Prairie facility, which will host four matches during this World Cup, including the opening fixture between USA and Canada. “I can practise at the stadium and there’s now outdoor nets being built. The facilities are just better in Dallas at the moment.\n\n“I’m a bit different to the other guys because I play tournaments outside the country, so I need some proper facilities throughout the year. Other people [elsewhere in the United States] will be stuck indoors whereas I can train outdoors [in Texas], which is what I need.”\n\nFor players, Texas represents the result of a “build it and they will come” philosophy. Dallas and Houston both now have infrastructure that attracts players domestically and from overseas. In the last year alone, more than a dozen cricketers, both international and domestic, have moved to one of the two cities.\n\nBut that doesn’t completely answer why the venue was built there in the first place.\n\n“We looked all over the country,” explains Justin Geale, tournament director for MLC, who have leased and developed the Grand Prairie facility in Dallas, completed less than a year ago.\n\n“The original thought was that it’s probably easier to convert a baseball stadium,” he says. The search for one such was extensive. “I’d be surprised if there’s a Minor League stadium in the country that’s closed or for sale that we didn’t know about.”\n\nIndeed, Grand Prairie was formerly home to the Texas AirHogs baseball team, who folded in 2020 following the Covid-19 pandemic. MLC saw the opportunity and convinced the local government of the value of a new stadium on the site.\n\nThe city of Grand Prairie owns the stadium and MLC has an exclusive lease to it. All the upgrades that have taken place, at a cost of US$21 million, have been funded by the investors and teams within MLC.\n\nThe actual site had enough space for a renovated stadium to be built, and practice facilities are now being added immediately outside it. But beyond that, Texas itself was an attractive location due its central location in the US (only three or four hours by flight from most places in the country), its climate, and a large South Asian diaspora.\n\n“The location is really important,” Geale explains. “It’s about 15-20 minutes from Dallas-Fort Worth airport, so it’s in a really accessible spot in a major city in Texas. Also, the weather means you can play around ten months of the year. So there’s an awful lot going for it from a geography standpoint, and also a demographic standpoint.”\n\nA key part of US cricket’s recent history involves Vijay Srinivasan and Sameer Mehta, co-founders of American Cricket Enterprises, which operates MLC, and crucially, are also co-founders of Willow TV, a 24x7 cricket channel in the US that broadcasts all major cricketing events in the country. Using their subscriber data allowed them to pinpoint where in the US would be best suited to building the nation’s cricketing hubs, which, unsurprisingly, were areas with large South Asian populations.\n\n“That was one of the things we looked at when allocating markets and thinking where this might work,” Geale says. “It’s a pretty expensive business so it makes sense to go for lower-hanging fruit, which is people that love the game, to start with, and building out from there.”\n\nDallas already boasted a number of indoor facilities, and it is estimated that there are over 1000 juniors playing cricket in the area. Furthermore, a Sixes Social Cricket bar is situated just north of the city, one of only two locations outside the UK where the cricket-themed bar has a venue.\n\n“I don’t think people know actually how much cricket there is in this country,” said Gous in an interview with the Washington Freedom franchise last summer. “It’s ridiculous. Everywhere in the country there’s cricket. If you want to play 12 months a year, you’ll find it.”\n\n“Until four or five years back,” says Dhandapani Devarasan, the head coach of the Dallas-based Mustang Cricket Academy, “many parents asked me what is the future of cricket here. Now, no one is asking.”\n\nMustang is owned by Lovkesh Kalia, who moved to the area in 1999. “When I arrived, we had eight teams and we all knew each other,” he reminisces. “Now there are probably more than 200 games being played every weekend. It’s amazing. And there are grounds popping up everywhere.\n\n“Literally the other week two new grounds came up, and now Celina is putting up two grounds. Prosper is putting up two grounds,” he says, referring to two towns north of Dallas. “And the reason they’re doing it is because they’ve figured out that South Asians migrate and cricket is very, very important to them. And there’s been a tremendous amount of migration in those places north of Dallas, so the cities are putting up cricket grounds. Before we had to beg them. Now they’re saying, ‘We have a cricket ground for you. Come down here.’ The growth has been tremendous.”\n\nWhile the growth has been exponential, the sport, at a recreational level at least, remains one that is played almost exclusively by the South Asian diaspora. According to Kalia, 99% of children playing in Dallas are of South Asian heritage. The question is whether that matters. After all, America is a massive country with a population of 335 million. And while those with Indian heritage make up just 1.4% of that figure, that’s 4.5 million people - only about 500,000 fewer than the population of New Zealand.\n\nAs such, the US boasts a passionate but diluted fan base that is spread across a country the size of a continent. But now, with children who are second- or third-generation Americans growing up and playing the sport their parents knew and loved, it is burgeoning and excelling in specific locations. Comparisons or questions about whether cricket will become the new baseball are lazy ones. It never has been, nor will it ever be the goal to make it that.\n\n“It’s such a big market, but I think we need to tap that community first,” Geale says. “But I genuinely do think there is an opportunity to grow a wider base because I don’t think you want to become just known as a sport played by immigrants. I think it’s probably taken Major League Soccer 20 years to shake that tag and become more mainstream. I think we need to tap that. We can go after new fans as well. But yeah, to say we’re going to be Major League Baseball is ridiculous.”\n\nThe plan now is for the USA national team to base themselves at Grand Prairie in the near future. There have also been discussions with English counties about the prospect of pre-season training camps being held in the city. But the ultimate aim is for Dallas to be the location where teams touring the West Indies add a handful of fixtures on to the end or start of a tour to play a strong US national team.\n\n“We’re building a high-performance centre,” says Geale. “And players really enjoy their time here. It’s a great place to bring the family and the golf clubs."

Washington Freedom has also signed several high-profile Australians, including Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Smith.\n\nThe MCL has gained List A status for its second season and will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with records counting towards official T20 statistics."

        "body": "Pat Cummins is all set for his maiden stint in USA’s Major League Cricket. Ahead of the second season of the league, the Australian skipper has been signed by the San Francisco Unicorns franchise. Aaron Finch led the Unicorns in the MLC 2023 season; however, after his retirement from T20 cricket, the franchise was in search of a new captain. With Cummins’ signing, it is expected that he will lead the side.\n\nPat Cummins set to lead San Francisco Unicorns\n\nDue to his workload, Cummins has not preferred to play much league cricket since 2019. He last played in the BBL in 2019, and since then, the IPL has been the sole league where he has participated. Now, Major League Cricket has been added to his schedule. MLC 2024 will kick off on July 6 (IST), and this window won’t witness much international cricket, as the T20 World Cup will conclude a week prior to MLC’s start.\n\nSince becoming Australia’s Test captain in 2021, Pat Cummins has been on a successful journey. During his tenure, Cummins has won The Ashes, the ICC World Test Championship, and the ICC World Cup. Recognizing his prowess as a skipper, he was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for a whopping 20.5 crore rupees. He performed brilliantly in the IPL 2024 season, leading SRH to a runner-up finish. Now, the San Francisco-based franchise has also placed their trust in him.\n\nHow did the San Francisco Unicorns fare in MLC 2023?\n\nLast season, under Aaron Finch’s captaincy, the team finished in 5th place in the 6-franchise tournament. The Unicorns won 2 of their 5 league games and missed out on the playoffs due to a low run rate. The current roster of the Unicorns features many star players, including Corey Anderson, Haris Rauf, Jake Fraser-McGurk, and Josh Inglis. Pat Cummins’ inclusion has further strengthened their squad.\n\nALSO READ: World Championship of Legends Cricket 2024: Schedule, Full Squads and Where to Watch"

        "body": "Australian Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins joins the San Francisco Unicorns for the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nIn a league first, superstar bowler Cummins has signed a four-year deal, which will see him pull on the Unicorns’ jersey until 2027.\n\nTickets for all matches are available now at tickets.majorleaguecricket.com.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns has announced that Australian cricket superstar and captain Pat Cummins has signed a four-year deal to play Major League Cricket (MLC) for the franchise from this season until 2027.\n\nCummins has won the ICC Cricket World Cup twice, the T20 World Cup once, and led Australia to the World Test Championship. The 31-year-old ICC Men’s Cricketer of the Year and Wisden’s Leading Cricketer in the World for 2023 is already lauded as an all-time great fast bowler and will be a game-changing addition to the Unicorns roster for the 2024 season.\n\nIn an MLC first, the fast bowler, who also captains IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad, has signed to the Unicorns for a four-year period, offering the team and league a significant vote of confidence as it looks to build out the franchise’s popularity with success on the pitch and the development of its cricket stadium in the Bay Area.\n\nWith pace bowling expertise set to complement the Unicorn’s fast bowling attack, which already features international class in Pakistan’s Haris Rauf and New Zealand’s Matt Henry, Cummins has shown himself to be a handy lower-order batter in the short format of T20, once holding the IPL record for the fastest to fifty runs, taking him just 14 balls.\n\n“I’m very excited to join the Unicorns ahead of the 2024 season,” said Cummins. “MLC is developing at a rapid rate, and the US market potential is huge for cricket.”\n\nThe Unicorns are co-owned by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Anand Rajamaran and Venky Harinarayan, who have shared a number of successful tech ventures, most notably founding and selling database technology provider Junglee, which was sold to Amazon in 1998 for $250m.\n\n“While cricket is integral to my involvement, the global network and long-term possibilities offered by the owners specifically, and Silicon Valley more broadly presented a unique opportunity for me and my life beyond cricket,” added Cummins.\n\n“Anand [Rajaraman] and Venky [Harinarayan] operate in a business world that excites me enormously and I can’t wait to be a part of it.”\n\nThis latest signing comes after MLC recently received List A status from the world cricket governing body, the ICC. The league is now regarded as an official T20 tournament, with playing records now counted towards official format statistics.\n\n“Pat Cummins has been one of the world’s great players across all formats for a number of years now and we are thrilled to welcome him to the Unicorns family,” said San Francisco Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman.\n\n“Pat’s commitment to a long-term contract demonstrates his faith in our vision for growing cricket in the Bay Area and more broadly across the US. We’re confident that, both on and off the pitch, he will bring a high caliber of performance that will help us achieve those goals.”"
