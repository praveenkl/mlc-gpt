        "body": "Australian pacer Pat Cummins has signed a four-year contract to play for the San Francisco Unicorns in Major League Cricket, the team announced on Tuesday.\n\nCummins will be the third Australian cricketer to play for the MLC team this season. Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk have already been signed by the Unicorns.\n\n“I’m very excited to join the Unicorns ahead of the 2024 season,” Cummins said. “MLC is developing at a rapid rate, and the US market potential is huge for cricket.”\n\nThe 31-year-old Cummins recently led the Sunrisers Hyderabad to the final of the Indian Premier League late last month. He is also a part of Australia’s squad for the T20 World Cup 2024, which is currently underway in the United States and the Caribbean.\n\nMajor League Cricket 2024 starts on July 5. The San Francisco Unicorns’ first match is on July 8 against the LA Knight Riders on July 7.\n\nSince making his debut, Cummins has played 146 matches in T20 cricket and picked up 163 wickets at 27.25 apiece. He gives away 8.13 runs per over and has a strike rate of 20.\n\nCummins’ best bowling figures in T20 cricket are 4/16, which came against Tasmania in the 2010-11 edition of the Big Bash League. He is a handy batter too, averaging 17.85.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns finished fifth among six teams in the inaugural season of MLC last year.\n\nAussies Steve Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell will play for the Washington Freedom team in MLC this season."

        "date": "Tue Jun  4 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "In a landmark move, Australia's Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins will feature in the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC). The 31-year-old fast bowler has signed with the San Francisco Unicorns, a franchise that maintains a strategic partnership with Victoria's first-class cricket setup in Australia. Cummins’ decision to participate in the MLC marks a significant step into the T20 franchise world, having recently led Hyderabad to the final of the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nCummins has been on a relentless cricketing journey since mid-February, juggling commitments between the Australian national team and the IPL. His MLC stint, commencing just five days after the conclusion of the World Cup, will cap off an intense period of cricket that began with Australia’s tour of New Zealand earlier this year. Cummins, renowned for his blistering pace, deceptive slower balls, pinpoint yorkers, and valuable lower-order batting, will undoubtedly bolster the Unicorns’ lineup. His presence is expected to be a game-changer, not only for the Unicorns but also for the overall talent pool of MLC players.\n\nStar-Studded International Signings\n\nCummins’ signing is part of a larger trend of high-profile international players joining MLC's six teams: Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom, and San Francisco Unicorns. This wave of signings underscores MLC’s growing reputation as a premier T20 league.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Bangladesh's veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, South African power-hitter David Miller, Irish fast-bowler Josh Little, Indian wicketkeeper-batter Adithya Ganesh, and Afghani spinner Waqar Salamkheil.\n\nMI New York: West Indian all-rounder Romario Shepherd and South African fast bowler Anrich Nortje.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Alongside Cummins, Australian wicketkeeper Josh Inglis, emerging batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk, and hard-hitting West Indian Sherfane Rutherford.\n\nSeattle Orcas: Fast bowlers West Indian Obed McCoy, South African Nandre Burger, and Australians Nathan Ellis and Lance Morris.\n\nTexas Super Kings: New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell, South African T20 captain Aiden Markram, Australian all-rounder Aaron Hardie, and Afghanistan's speedster Naveen ul Haq.\n\nWashington Freedom: Batting talents Steve Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Jack Edwards, and New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra.\n\nHistorically, Cummins has been selective about participating in T20 franchise cricket, making his decision to join MLC particularly noteworthy. This move signals MLC’s growing stature and its ability to attract top-tier international talent. Cummins joins a cadre of fellow Australians, including Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith, and Jake Fraser-McGurk, who have signed on for MLC’s second season. Rumors also suggest that Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, and other members of Australia’s World Cup squad may also be heading stateside.\n\nThe second season of MLC begins on July 5 with an exciting doubleheader. Defending champions MI New York will face off against Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season’s finale in Morrisville. Later that day, Texas Super Kings will play their home game against the LA Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in the Dallas Metro area. Cummins’ participation in MLC not only enhances the league's competitive edge but also reinforces its position on the global T20 stage. As the MLC continues to attract cricket's biggest names, fans can look forward to an electrifying season filled with high-octane action and stellar performances.\n\nTune In"

Australia, as per the Future Tours Programme, are due to tour the West Indies for an all-format series - two Tests, three ODIs, three T20Is - in June-July next year. As Australia's Test and ODI captain, how Cummins' availability for either assignment might be affected remains to be seen. He does not lead in T20I cricket, but recently captained his IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL 2024 final.\n\nHard-hitting Australian batter Jake Fraser-McGurk will join Cummins at San Francisco Unicorns this season. Washington Freedom is another franchise that has signed a number of high-profile Australians, including Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Steven Smith. Washington also contracted New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra.\n\nOther high-profile MLC signings for 2024 include Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan and South Africa's David Miller to Los Angeles Knight Riders, South Africa's Anrich Nortje and West Indies' Romario Shepherd to MI New York, South Africa's Aiden Markram and New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell to Texas Super Kings, and South Africa's Nandre Burger and West Indies' Obed McCoy to Seattle Orcas.\n\nIn its second season, MLC will have List A status, the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire it from the ICC after the UAE's ILT20. That means MLC will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with records counting towards official T20 statistics."

With the league currently featuring six franchises, there are plans to launch two more in the near future, with MLC recently granted List A status by the ICC.\n\nThe 2024 season does not clash with any of Australia’s upcoming international fixtures. Following the T20 World Cup, Australia’s next international fixture is a white ball tour of England in September.

        "date": "Tue Jun  4 14:23:02 2024",
        "body": "Former England captain Eoin Morgan has spoken about the potential for cricket to grow in the USA.\n\nThe USA had played the first international cricket match in history, back in 1844, but the sport had faded away after the First World War. Of late, however, there has been a conscious effort to make the sport popular in the nation again – through the Major League Cricket, the 2024 T20 World Cup, and a return of cricket in the Olympics after 128 years, in 2028 at Los Angeles.\n\nThe USA are co-hosting the 2024 T20 World Cup along with two-time champions West Indies. Eight matches, including the marquee India-Pakistan clash, will be played at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, while the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas and the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill will host four games each.\n\n“I’m unbelievably excited about going and watching a game in New York because I’ve just come back from the IPL where everybody is talking about you know the biggest game in cricket happening in New York,” said Eoin Morgan in conversation with Mel Farrell on the Wisden Cricket Weekly podcast.\n\nPart of the ICC commentary team at the World Cup, Morgan spoke about New York hosting a match featuring India and his former team, Ireland: “It’s going to be great to see India playing against the Men in Green, Ireland. I’m going to be there at that game as a fan, not as a commentator, and there are a few of my friends attending as well.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a great spectacle and a huge opportunity, when you think of the MLC last year being a success and sort of raising awareness about the opportunity that cricket could pose in the States.\n\n“You get a lot of people in England saying, ‘Well, do you think it will work?’ The answer is it’s already worked. I’m sorry, we’re already late to the party. When you have players having to choose between their home tournament and a tournament abroad, a player will always pick his home tournament if they you know if the opportunity is right. If the contract is right, there’s not one person that I’ve ever played cricket with that would turn down a big opportunity at home over something else.”\n\nThe MLC’s pull as a tournament is expanding. Former England opener Jason Roy will play there instead of the second half of the T20 Blast group stage (the English domestic T20 competition), while several high profile Australians are likely to compete in the second edition of the American franchise competition as well.\n\n“So, you have to give credit where credit is due. They’ve launched a good tournament [MLC] in the lead into this year’s World Cup. Over the last four months, we’ve seen social media reaction of the Nassau County international Cricket Stadium, which is just amazing. You really do get the impression following American sport in general that if they commit to something, they are all in. I get the feeling about that this World Cup is no different. So yeah, it will be brilliant.”"

        "body": "Australia Test skipper Pat Cummins has given cricket in the United States a huge boost after signing a shock four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nCummins became the latest – and biggest – signing for Major League Cricket (MLC), which in its second season has been given official ‘List A’ status.\n\nThat designation means playing records in the fledgling American Twenty20 competition will now be counted towards official statistics.\n\nCummins joins a fast-bowling attack at the Unicorns that also features Pakistan’s Haris Rauf and New Zealand quick Matt Henry.\n\nAustralian batting sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk is also with the San Francisco franchise.\n\nWashington Freedom have loaded up on Australian stars, signing Steve Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell.\n\nBut Cummins, who is signed with the Unicorns until the end of 2027 in a deal that is expected to earn him huge money, represents the league’s biggest get.\n\nDon’t miss the ICC Men’s #T20WorldCup! Watch live and exclusively NOW – it’s on Prime\n\nThe 31-year-old remains at the peak of his powers, and last month was named Wisden’s cricketer of the year after guiding Australia to one-day World Cup glory as well as the World Test Championship crown.\n\nCummins, who will be in the West Indies and the US this month as part of Australia’s T20 World Cup campaign, is also the reigning International Cricket Council player of the year.\n\nThe Unicorns are co-owned by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Anand Rajamaran and Venky Harinarayan.\n\nThe chance to help promote cricket in the US combined with business opportunities at the Unicorns helped convince Cummins to sign a four-year deal.\n\n“MLC is developing at a rapid rate, and the US market potential is huge for cricket,” Cummins said in a statement.\n\n“While cricket is integral to my involvement, the global network and long-term possibilities offered by the owners specifically, and Silicon Valley more broadly, presented a unique opportunity for me and my life beyond cricket.”\n\nCummins hasn’t played in Australia’s Big Bash League since 2018 due to international commitments.\n\nBut he showcased his immense value in the T20 format by captaining the Sunrisers Hyderabad to the recent Indian Premier League final, where they lost to the Mitchell Starc-inspired Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nThe 2024 Major League Cricket season will start on July 5, with San Francisco Unicorns’ first match coming on July 7 when they take on the LA Knight Riders."

        "body": "The San Francisco Unicorns have made a significant acquisition ahead of the USA-based Major League Cricket’s (MCL) second season by signing Pakistan’s rising star, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pakistan spinner has been making headlines with his outstanding performances in international cricket, particularly in the Test format, where he has claimed 17 wickets in just four appearances.\n\nAbrar's rise began in Test cricket, where his ability to spin the ball and trouble top-order batters caught the attention of selectors. His consistent wicket-taking ability earned him a spot in Pakistan’s national T20 World Cup squad.\n\nIn addition to his international impact as a spinner, Abrar showcased his skills in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), representing the Quetta Gladiators. He notched up 16 wickets in 10 innings, solidifying his reputation as a reliable spinner in the T20 format as he finished as the third-highest wicket-taker in the tournament.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns, one of the eight franchises in MLC, recognized Abrar’s potential and moved quickly to secure his services. As the MLC prepares for its second season, the addition of a player of Abrar’s caliber is a significant boost for the USA-based franchise.\n\nThe second edition of the MLC season is set to commence in mid-July 2024."

        "date": "Wed Jun  5 06:02:00 2024",
        "body": "Australian fast-bowling superstar Pat Cummins has sent shockwaves through the cricketing world by signing a four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns, a franchise in the up-and-coming Major League Cricket (MLC) league in the USA.\n\nGame-Changing move for Pat Cummins and MLC\n\nPat Cummins’ decision is a significant one. He has rarely ventured outside the established leagues, previously only playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nHis absence from Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL) since 2018 due to international commitments highlights his focus on the highest level of cricket. However, the lure of the MLC and its future potential has proven irresistible for Cummins.\n\nBusiness Opportunities Beckon for San Francisco Unicorns\n\nIn a statement released by the San Francisco Unicorns, Pat Cummins expressed his excitement about the MLC’s growth and the vast potential of the US market for cricket. However, his motivations extend beyond the sport itself.\n\nThe “global network and long-term possibilities” offered by the franchise’s Silicon Valley-based owners are particularly enticing to Cummins.\n\nHe sees an opportunity to engage with the business world beyond his cricketing career and is eager to collaborate with the franchise’s co-owners, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, who are prominent figures in the tech industry.\n\nInternational Cricket vs MLC Commitments\n\nThe MLC season runs from July 6th to 29th this year. This timeframe coincides with Australia’s scheduled tour of the West Indies in June-July next year, raising questions about Cummins’ availability for the international matches.\n\nAs Australia’s Test and ODI captain, his presence on that tour would be crucial. While the impact on his T20I involvement remains to be seen, Cummins recently captained the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL 2024 final, so a complete T20I absence seems unlikely.\n\nMLC boasts star-studded roster\n\nCummins joins a growing list of high-profile cricketers signing with MLC franchises. The San Francisco Unicorns also secured the services of Australian batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk.\n\nAnother MLC team, the Washington Freedom, boasts a strong Australian contingent with Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, and the legendary Steven Smith joining their ranks. This influx of international talent further strengthens the MLC’s position as a rising force in global cricket.\n\nMLC Gains Official Recognition from ICC\n\nThe MLC’s second season brings an exciting development: List A status. This prestigious designation, previously only held by the UAE’s ILT20 among Associate-run franchise competitions, recognizes the MLC as an official T20 league. This means statistics recorded during MLC matches will now count towards official T20 player records.\n\nWith Pat Cummins leading the charge, the MLC is poised for a spectacular season, attracting top international talent and gaining official recognition. This innovative league is undoubtedly changing the landscape of T20 cricket across the globe."

        "date": "Mon Jun  3 13:44:00 2024",
        "body": "Australian cricket superstar Pat Cummins is all set to make waves in the USA's Major League Cricket (MLC) as the latest high-profile signing for the next edition of the tournament after the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his Australian compatriots like Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith, and Jake Fraser-McGurk, Cummins is all set to make his MLC debut this season.\n\nAccording to Cricbuzz, Cummins, who led the Australian cricket team to victory in the World Test Championship Final and the ODI World Cup against India, has been signed by the San Francisco Unicorns for the second edition of the MLC 2024.\n\nPat Cummins to make MLC debut after stellar IPL 2024 campaign\n\nCummins is expected to fill the void left by Aaron Finch's retirement, as the Aussie speedster will be the new captain of the San Francisco Unicorns. Cummins, who led the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) to the IPL 2024 Final, will join forces with fellow Australians Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk in the San Francisco Unicorns lineup for the upcoming MLC 2024.\n\nThis move added to an already grueling schedule for Cummins that commenced with Australia's tour of New Zealand in February 2024. It is being said that Australia’s T20I captain Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, and several Australians from their T20 World Cup 2024 squad are also expected to make entry to the three-week franchise competition in America.\n\nNotably, the Australian fast bowler recently shined as a captain on his debut IPL season. However, the SRH lost the IPL 2024 final to the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) last month, but Cummins' leadership credentials were praised highly by the former cricketers and cricket experts. He was also impressive with the ball for the SRH in the IPL 2024, taking 18 wickets.\n\nMLC 2024 to start next month in the USA\n\nWell, the upcoming MLC 2024 is scheduled to kick off on July 5 in the USA, just days after the conclusion of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2024. The MLC recently earned List-A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) and joined the ranks of elite Associate-run franchise competitions after UAE's International League T20 (ILT20).\n\nThe second edition of the MLC promises an enthralling start, with defending champions MI New York locking horns with runners-up Seattle Orcas at Church Street Park in Morrisville on July 5. The opening day festivities will feature a doubleheader, with the Texas Super Kings squaring off against the LA Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nNotably, the Australian cricket team is currently gearing up for the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024 in the USA and West Indies and Cummins is expected to play a crucial role in their campaign. Australia is slotted alongside England, Namibia, Oman, and Scotland in Group B at the 2024 T20 World Cup."

        "body": "Aaron Jones played an unbelievable inning to take this side over the finishing line. He scored 94 runs in only 40 deliveries to help the USA start the T20 World Cup 2024 campaign on a positive note. He is hoping that his inning against Canada will open the eyes of those who don't know anything about him or USA cricket. Jones was released by Major League Cricket franchise Seattle Orcas after its inaugural edition. He was not picked in the last MLC draft.\n\nRead Also: Most Sixes in the T20 World Cup\n\nAaron Jones and Andries Gous led the USA to their victory against Canada\n\n\"When I wasn't selected in the Major League, I just took it as a stepping stone in the journey. I would have loved to get drafted, so it goes sometimes. Hopefully, tonight's innings will probably open the eyes of those who don't know me or USA cricket. We have great players here and we have a lot of talent here and are willing to play at the highest level for sure,\" Aaron Jones said after the game.\n\nUSA had a poor start and they lost the wicket of Steven Taylor for a duck in the second ball of the inning. They were 42/2 after 6.3 overs. But Jones played a counter-attacking inning and completed the chase with 14 balls to spare. He smashed 10 sixes in the game, the second most in a T20 World Cup inning after Chris Gayle's 11 against England in 2016.\n\nAndries Gous also played an important inning and was instrumental in USA's victory. He scored 65 runs off 46 balls and helped Aaron from the other end. Jones and Andries Gous stood tall and added 131 runs for the third wicket.\n\n\"I don't think it is easy to put it into words. We know Canada comes hard against us since it is a big rivalry. Happy to take the team over the line. Sometimes as a cricketer, you could go a bit under the radar if you have a few low scores. I always back myself and know that I am capable of performing at every level. Happy that I came out on top and won the game for the USA. Hope it opens the eyes of some people around the world that I am good enough to play T20 cricket. I believe in myself, I work hard and I just use it as motivation. I know that I'm good enough to play at the highest level, and whenever given the opportunity, I'll do my best for sure,\" Jones further added.\n\nUSA will next face Pakistan at the same venue on Thursday and play India in ten days, while Canada will face Ireland in New York on Friday. Jones said they will continue to play fearless cricket."
