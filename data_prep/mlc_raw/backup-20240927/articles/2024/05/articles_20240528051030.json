        "title": "Major League Cricket’s expansion plan poses a threat to English competitions",
        "date": "Mon May 27 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Major League Cricket has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the US. In a move that will have significant implications for the landscape of the professional sport in England, MLC, which began with a 19-game season, has confirmed it will expand to 34 games by 2025.\n\nThe US league now has six franchises but plans to launch two more in the near future, and two more soon after that. The announcement comes just after MLC has been fully legitimised by the news that its matches have been awarded List A status by the International Cricket Council.\n\n“It was always intended to be a 10‑team league,” the MLC chief exe­cutive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the ­Guardian. “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nThe second season, which starts at the end of the men’s T20 World Cup, runs for 23 days and overlaps with the Hundred. The US tournament next year will be significantly longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC is keen to play in June.\n\n“Ultimately for us our ideal calen­dar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,” Srinivasan said. The tournament was pushed back this year because of the T20 World Cup, which is using the MLC’s stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas. “With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nThat would clash with the T20 Blast season but leave the Hundred to run from late July through August.\n\nEnglish cricket has already had to adapt to sharing its summer with a competing league. Last year Jason Roy gave up his England contract so he could take a job with LA Knight Riders, while Surrey’s Sunil Narine skipped the county side’s appearance on Blast finals day because he was also playing for LA. Alec Stewart, Surrey’s director of cricket, said at the time it was “disappointing and frustrating” to “lose a player of ­Narine’s quality at late notice”. Narine’s ­decision was a sobering reminder of the status of English domestic cricket.\n\nMLC’s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed that it was the “direction of travel” for the game on 10 May, but there is frustration about slow progress. MLC boasts a formidable array of investors, including four IPL sides – Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals – as well as significant business figures such as Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella.\n\n“All of these people who came on board with us when we started five years ago have been immensely successful in other walks of life,” Srinivasan said. “You know they understand that this is not one of those things where you can just turn a switch. The expectation was never that this would be an overnight transition. They’ve been immensely patient and they’ve backed us all the way through.”\n\nMLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local ­players. It is now working on ­developing more List A venues. “We’re not here to play a league and go away every year,” Srinivasan said.\n\n“We feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think 10 years from now, I think you’ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we’ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.”"

        "date": "Thu Jul 13 22:00:00 2023",
        "body": "Move over, pickleball. There’s an even bigger sport in town.\n\nThis week, Major League Cricket will play its first-ever game in the U.S. and every last ticket to the highly anticipated opener has been sold. (Don’t worry, it’s also being broadcast live.) The Texas Super Kings will face off against the Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Thursday. The 6,000-person venue replaced the former home of the professional baseball team, the AirHogs. Anurag Jain, the managing partner of venture capitalist firm Perot Jain, is part-owner of the Texas Super Kings and founded the Dallas-based franchise earlier this year in hopes of creating a buzz stateside.\n\nMore from Robb Report\n\nThe Texas Food Scene Can't Decide Whether It Wants a Michelin Guide\n\nA Thief Stole $600,000 Worth of Wine From This L.A. Bottle Shop\n\nThis $37 Million Tuscan-Inspired Estate in Los Angeles Will Transport You to the 1920s Italian Countryside\n\n“My vested interest was to bring cricket right into the heart of America,” Jain told Bloomberg. “I see a lot of cricket being played one off, club level, league level, at the local levels. But not at the professional level and that’s what I really wanted to change.”\n\nCricket is currently ranked as the second-biggest sport in the world right behind soccer, and Jain’s not the only one betting on its future. Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside business mogul Jay Mehta, acquired the Knight Riders back in 2020 and has plans to build his own state-of-the-art cricket stadium 40 miles outside L.A. The $30 million venture is being spearheaded by Major League Cricket and designed by award-winning architecture firm HKS.\n\nHistorically, the bat and ball sport has struggled to develop a fan base outside of India, South Africa, Australia, and the U.K. However, deep-pocketed investors are willing to put an impressive $120 million into the U.S. league to expand its profile in America, Bloomberg reported.\n\nOf course, with this kind of financial backing, cricketers from across the globe want in on the action. The Texas Super Kings have since signed overseas players including Devon Conway, Dwayne Bravo, and David Miller. Veteran South African batter Faf du Plessis has also joined the team as captain, while West Indies spinner Sunil Narine leads the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n“American sports fans want to see the best in the world,” MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport. “That’s the demand in U.S. professional sports.”\n\nSign up for Robb Report's Newsletter.

        "body": "Jason Roy has given up his England contract in order to play in this summer’s first edition of Major League Cricket.\n\nRoy made a request to the ECB to be released to play in the US franchise tournament, which England have granted on the condition that the World Cup-winning opener relinquish the remainder of his incremental deal.\n\nThe 32-year-old will not miss any England matches in order to play in the tournament, with Jos Buttler’s side not in white-ball action this summer until late-August, but under the terms of their contract the ECB could have asked him to rest during the gap between the Vitality Blast and Hundred. Roy’s decision will not effect his future selection prospects, with the batter still England’s incumbent opener in ODI cricket ahead of their World Cup defence in India this autumn.\n\nIn a statement, Roy insisted representing England remained his chief priority.\n\n“I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will ‘walk away from England’,” Roy said. “Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer. I hope to play for England for many more years.”\n\nRoy is set to become the first English player to sign up to the new competition, which takes place in Texas during the final two weeks of July, with reports suggesting he is likely to turn out for the LA Knight Riders, one of six newly-formed teams, four of which are at least partially backed by IPL owners.\n\nRoy has just returned from a stint with Kolkata Knight Riders at the IPL and is set to make his first Surrey appearance of the season in Thursday’s Blast opener against Middlesex at Lord’s.\n\nIt is understood that Roy will still be available for the entirety of Surrey’s Blast campaign, including Finals Day on July 15 should the county get that far, before flying to the US and then returning in time to play for Oval Invincibles in the Hundred.\n\nRoy was demoted to an incremental deal last October, having been dropped by England’s T20 side ahead of their successful World Cup campaign, and will now forgo the remainder of his salary up until the contract was due to expire at the end of September.\n\nIncremental contracts are worth between £60,000 and £70,000 a year and Roy could earn more than twice that amount for just two weeks’ work in the US."

No purchase, services or other agreement is concluded between the End Customer and vivenu.\n\n2.2 The End Customer acknowledges that the Organizer may make the sale of Tickets and other Offers subject to the acceptance of further conditions, data protection declarations, instructions for cancellation and other contractual components by the End Customer and other restrictions (such as maximum number of Tickets for an Event). The Organizer or vivenu (on behalf of the Organizer) shall be entitled to refuse or reject the conclusion of purchase transactions with the End Customer for any legal reason.\n\n2.3 The End Customer acknowledges that the total purchase price of Tickets and Offers shall be determined or modified solely by the Organizer or third parties who sell to or through the Organizer.

The calculation of the total purchase price shall be based on the indicated ticket price with the addition of any markup, fees, surcharges and taxes.

Payment of the total purchase price can only be made by the payment methods provided by the Organizer or vivenu (on behalf of the Organizer).\n\n2.4 The contract between the Organizer and the End Customer for the purchase and sale of Tickets or Offers shall deemed completed only when the Organizer or vivenu (on behalf of the Organizer) has confirmed the transaction with the End Customer (e.g., by providing the transaction confirmation or by the assignment and subsequent transfer of a Ticket with the corresponding ticket ID). The completion of the ordering process, without such confirmation, such does not constitute a binding contract and does not entitle the End Customer to participate in an Event.\n\n2.5 If Ticket quotas (both the total quota for the Event and the quotas of individual categories of Tickets) have been exceeded due to technical issues, the Organizer or vivenu (on behalf of the Organizer) shall notify the End Customer.

The form of the Tickets provided will depend on the method of admission entry utilized by the Organizer for a particular Event and will be communicated to the End Customer (such as by downloading and printing the Ticket, digital wallet or other options). To participate in an Event, the Ticket must be presented in the form provided. Presentation of the email for the order confirmation alone (without providing the Ticket in the correct form) does not entitle the End Customer to participate in an Event.\n\n3.2 If the Organizer provides such option, the End Customer has the ability to order Tickets in printed form and shipped to the End Customer for an additional fee (hereinafter \"Printed Tickets\").\n\n3.3 The End Customer is required to verify that the purchased Tickets are correct in terms of quantity, price, date, event, venue and other essential details. Any complaint about incorrect Tickets must be reported to the Organizer or vivenu (on behalf of the Organizer) promptly after the purchase, and in no event later than five business days following the End Customer’s becoming aware of the issue that is the subject of the complaint.\n\n3.4 The transfer of ownership of Tickets or related rights to the End Customer shall only occur upon the full payment of the total purchase price and the settlement of all outstanding claims for payment from the End Customer to the Organizer.\n\n3.5 The End Customer must provide truthful, complete and correct information as part of the purchase transaction. The Organizer or vivenu (on behalf of the Organizer) shall be authorized to verify the information provided by the End Customer using appropriate legal means (such as credit reports when properly authorized).\n\n4.

The Organizer may refuse or terminate the participation of an End Customer in an Event upon non-compliance with such requirements.\n\n4.4 If the Organizer or vivenu (on behalf of the Organizer) reasonably suspects abuse or legal violations (including legal violations of these General Terms and Conditions or other applicable terms of the contract between the Organizer and the End Customer), such as through fraudulent, illegal or breach of disloyal activities or of corresponding circumvention or attempts to circumvent such provisions and conditions, the Organizer or vivenu (on behalf of the Organizer) may revoke the validity of a Ticket without compensation before or during an Event and deny the End Customer the right to participate in an Event or remove the End Customer from the Event.\n\n4.5 If Tickets are damaged, lost or stolen, the End Customer must notify the Organizer and vivenu without delay. If the End Customer loses a Ticket, the Organizer or vivenu shall not be obligated to provide a replacement.\n\n4.6 Unless otherwise agreed, the validity of a Ticket shall be restricted to the respective Event (in particular, in terms of time and place) and, if necessary, the respective seat or seat unit or the corresponding ticket category.

During maintenance work there may be temporary disruptions of the web site and/or individual vivenu Services.\n\n5. Transfer of Tickets\n\n5.1 Except as expressly set out in these Terms and Conditions (in particular, paragraph 5.2 below), Tickets cannot be exchanged or transferred. An End Consumer may purchase Tickets for their own personal use and/or that of their guests, but may not purchase any Ticket as an agent for another person or with the intention of re-selling them above face value or for any commercial gain. Ticket Purchasers shall not (and shall procure that each of their guests shall not) sell, offer for sale, auction by any means, re-sell or (save as expressly set out in these Terms and Conditions) transfer a Ticket without the prior written approval of the Organizer. All End Consumers are responsible for ensuring that their guests fully understand these restrictions.\n\n5.2. Any Ticket may be transferred following the original purchase of such Ticket by the End Consumer, provided in the case of each transfer that:\n\n5.2.1 the guest is known to the End Customer personally;\n\n5.2.2 it is for such guest’s personal use only;\n\n5.2.3 such guest would be entitled (under these Terms and Conditions) to purchase such Ticket and/or attend such Match;\n\n5.2.4 the sale or transfer takes place in consideration of no payment or benefit which is in excess of the face value of that Ticket;\n\n5.2.5 the sale or transfer does not take place during the course of any business or for the purpose of facilitating any third party’s business; and\n\n5.2.6 the End Customer shall be responsible for the conduct of their guests and their compliance with these Terms and Conditions.\n\n5.3 Tickets shall not, without the prior written permission of the Organizer be used for any promotion, advertising, fundraising, auction, raffle or any other similar commercial or non-commercial purposes; used as a prize (or part of a prize) in any contest, competition, (promotional) game of chance, lottery or sweepstake; combined with and sold or transferred as part of any package of goods or services or otherwise used to enhance the demand for any other goods or services; combined with and sold or transferred as part of any travel, accommodation, entertainment or hospitality package; offered or transferred, used or otherwise disposed of in the course of any business for the purpose of facilitating a third party’s business or otherwise commercial gain.\n\n5.4 Any Ticket acquired, obtained and/or used in breach of these Terms and Conditions shall be null and void. The Organizer shall be entitled to confiscate, require the immediate return of, cancel and/or invalidate any Ticket(s) which are offered for sale, transferred, acquired or otherwise used in contravention of these Terms and Conditions and no refund shall be given.\n\n5.5 The Organizer (or any of its employees or agents) may request photographic proof of identity of the End Consumer before allowing entry into the Venue as well as proof of purchase as to how, from whom and from where the Tickets have been obtained. If an End Customer is unable to provide evidence to the Organizer’s reasonable satisfaction, the Organizer may in its absolute discretion cancel the Ticket(s) immediately and the End Consumer may be refused admission to and/or removed from the relevant Event without compensation or refund.\n\n5.6 To re-assign/personalize Tickets or any related identification information, please contact the Organizer. A processing fee may apply to this service.\n\n6. Revocation, Cancellation, Refund, Return and Exchange of Tickets\n\n6.1 ALL TICKET SALES ARE FINAL. NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN. There are no rights of revocation, return, cancellation or exchange of Tickets for Events, except were otherwise provided by applicable law, or permitted in the sole discretion of the Organizer. Subject to the foregoing, any purchase of Tickets is binding immediately upon completion of the purchase transaction (i.e., confirmation from the Organizer that the purchase has been completed) and cannot be cancelled.\n\n6.2 THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY if admission to the Venue is refused or revoked without cause, stadium capacity limits result in Ticket cancellation, or the Match is cancelled and not rescheduled for any reason, is a refund of up to the ticket’s face value as set by the Organizer. Otherwise, a refund of up to the face value of the ticket shall only be issued if:\n\n6.2.1 less than six (6) overs are completed during the entire Match and no result is recorded for the Match; or\n\n6.2.2 the End Consumer is entitled to a refund under applicable law.\n\nPlease note: For purposes of 6.2.1 of these Terms and Conditions, the question of whether a “result” has been recorded will be determined having regard to the Laws of Cricket (as in force at the relevant time). Where a ticket grants access to multiple Matches in one day, a refund will only be payable where paragraph 6.2 above applies to all the Matches played on that day.\n\n6.3 For the avoidance of doubt, no refund will be payable where the start time for any Match is moved or otherwise delayed but the Match takes place on the date originally scheduled. Organizer shall in no way be required to refund any fees or charges paid in addition to the face value and no interest or other costs will be payable in respect of any monies refunded.\n\n6.4 Organizer reserves the right to make alterations to the time, date and Venue of any Match at Organizer’s sole discretion. No such change shall entitle End Customer to a refund or remedy if End Customer cannot attend the rescheduled Match or for any other reason. End Customer may also be relocated to a different seating area or seating number to that referred to on a Ticket in the Organizer's sole discretion and no such relocation shall entitle End Customer to a refund or other remedy if End Customer is relocated to a location of comparable face value.\n\n6.5 The End Customer is not guaranteed an uninterrupted and/or uninhibited view of any Match from the position provided, nor is any representation given as to the quality, content or duration of any Match. The End Customer acknowledges and accepts that the Organizer does not guarantee protection from the weather and elements from their seat.\n\n6.6 vivenu shall process the exchange or refund on behalf of the Organizer. The refund will be made to the End Customer using a payment method selected by vivenu (on behalf of the Organizer).\n\n7. Liability\n\n7.1 Except where otherwise provided by nonwaivable provisions of applicable law (e.g. in cases of breach of material contractual obligations, injury to life, body or health), the Organizer shall be liable only for intentional misconduct and gross negligence. Except where otherwise provided by nonwaivable provisions of applicable law, liability fora slightly negligent breach of material contractual obligations shall be limited in amount to the transaction value related to the transaction giving rise to the liability. Subject to the foregoing limitations, the Organizer shall not be liable for damages due to force majeure or violations of obligations by third parties.\n\n7.2 To the extent that the Organizer’s liability is excluded or limited herein, the foregoing limitation of liability shall also apply to the personal liability of the Organizer’s legal representatives and agents as well as any representatives acting for the Organizer with regard to the End Customer, including without limitation vivenu and its affiliates, each of which representatives and agents is an intended third party beneficiary of the contract between the Organizer and the End Customer, with the power to enforce the contract as if a party hereto.\n\n7.3 The End Customer hereby acknowledges and agrees that: Except as provided to the contrary by nonwaivable provisions of applicable law, vivenu shall have no liability to the End Customer when acting on behalf of the Organizer as an agent or otherwise. vivenu shall not be liable for damages caused by force majeure or breach of duty by third parties.\n\n7.4 To the extent that vivenu’s liability is excluded or limited, this disclaimer or limitation of liability shall also apply to the personal liability of vivenu's legal representatives and vicarious agents as well as any representatives acting for vivenu with regard to the End Customer. Not in limitation of the foregoing, vivenu shall not be liable for damages resulting from an Event’s failure, cancellation, modification, relocation or defect or the Organizer’s insolvency or loss or delayed arrival or defects in Printed Tickets as well as limitations in vivenu Services.\n\n8. Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n8.1 These General Terms and Conditions shall take precedence over any provisions to the contrary in the contractual relationship between the Organizer and the End Customer.\n\n8.2 The laws of the state of the incorporation of the Organizer shall apply, and the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods (hereinafter “CISG”) shall not apply. This shall not affect statutory provisions restricting the choice of law and the applicability of mandatory provisions.\n\n8.3 Insofar as the End Customer is not a Consumer, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes between (i) the End Customer and the Organizer shall be the registered office of the Organizer and (ii) between the End Customer and vivenu shall be Düsseldorf, Germany.\n\n8.4 The End Customer shall be deemed to be a “Consumer” insofar as the purpose of the ordered deliveries and services is not attributed to his commercial or self-employed professional activity.
