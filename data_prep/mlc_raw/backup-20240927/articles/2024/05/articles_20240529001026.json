        "body": "Six-team MLC to initially grow to eight franchises before adding two more\n\nCompetition awarded List A status by ICC\n\nJune start would mean clash with England’s T20 Blast\n\nUS Twenty20 competition Major League Cricket (MLC) plans to expand to ten teams as part of efforts to grow the sport in the country.\n\nThe six-team tournament will hold its second season from 5th to 28th July, which will see half a dozen more matches played compared to the 19 for the inaugural campaign in 2023. The US is also preparing to co-host the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup alongside the West Indies, with games to be played in Florida, New York and Texas.\n\nMLC currently has franchises based in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Washington, but intends to add two new teams in the near future and two more soon after that.\n\n“It was always intended to be a ten‑team league,” MLC chief exe­cutive Vijay Srinivasan told The Guardian. “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support team teams, so that’s our plan.\n\n“We had 19 games in our first season, [we] will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nSrinivasan added that the league was eager to play in June and have that month as its permanent calendar spot.\n\n“Ultimately for us our ideal calen­dar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,” he said. “The tournament was pushed back this year because of the T20 World Cup, which is using the MLC’s stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\n“With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nThe announcement arrives shortly after the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarded MLC matches with List A status – one of the three major forms of cricket recognised by the game’s global governing body. It sees MLC become the second associate-nation-run T20 tournament to attain List A status, following the International League T20 (ILT20) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nAs well as aiming to make MLC one of cricket’s top domestic T20 leagues, perhaps even second only to the Indian Premier League (IPL), organisers have established academies and a minor league system to develop local players. They are also working on building more List A venues, including grounds for MLC teams.\n\n“We’re not here to play a league and go away every year,” said Srinivasan.\n\n“We feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think ten years from now, I think you’ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we’ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.”\n\nSportsPro says…\n\nIf MLC is a success, it has the potential to alter the economics of cricket – a sport where India remains far and away its most lucrative market.\n\nHowever, another domestic T20 league poses a headache for rival competitions, notably in England. This year’s MLC season, which starts less than a week after the Men’s T20 World Cup concludes, will partly overlap with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s (ECB) The Hundred, which takes place from 23rd July to 18th August.\n\nA June start from 2025 for MLC would mean The Hundred could run unopposed but would result in a clash with the T20 Blast, another English domestic competition, and put counties at risk of losing players to MLC. This year’s T20 Blast is pencilled in from 30th May to 14th September.\n\nThe arrival of MLC has also led to further pressure for a decision on allowing private investment into The Hundred to help it compete with rival franchise competitions. This is partly due to MLC’s enviable set of investors, with four of its teams controlled by IPL franchise owners – the Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals, Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella also co-owns the Seattle Orcas.\n\nIn April, the ECB revealed it had begun the process of securing private investment in The Hundred. The national governing body, along with England’s 18 first-class counties and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), agreed earlier this month that external funding was the “direction of travel” for the English game but there is frustration about the slow progress.\n\nMLC and the wider growth of cricket in the US are key priorities for the ICC. However, the league’s emergence has left other competitions, aside from the IPL, wary as they seek to retain market share.\n\nGet your daily briefing of all the essential news across the sports industry with the SportsPro Daily Newsletter.

        "date": "Tue May 28 07:17:01 2024",
        "body": "Following UAE’s ILT20’s accreditation of List A status by the ICC earlier this year, Major League Cricket (MLC) has become the second the competition with franchises run by associates to acquire a List A status by the ICC.\n\nThe accreditation of the list A status means that MLC will now be recognized as an official T20 league by the ICC, which would benefit the organizers of the league. MLC Director, Justin Geale expressed his excitement over the news, revealing how important the step would be in order to explore the cricket market in the United States.\n\nTalking to ESPNcricinfo Geale thanked the efforts from the ICC to take a look at the cricket in the USA and providing them with the official recognition.\n\n\"We are really excited for the news as it's a recognition of the standard and high quality of players taking part in the tournament. By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale.\" he said.\n\nUSA will also be hosting the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup alongside the West Indies starting June 1. The prestigious tournament in being hosted on North American soil for the first time and will be a huge opportunity to explore the American cricket market\n\n“We are an Associate nation and proud of that, one with a unique opportunity in front of us. It's our hope that on the back of the upcoming World Cup and a successful season we can continue to build a platform for the sport to grow and ultimately succeed in the USA,” Geale said.\n\nMoreover, cricket will also make its debut as an Olympic sport at 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\nREAD MORE: Eoin Morgan considers India as favourites in T20 World Cup 2024\n\nWhen will Major League Cricket 2024 start?\n\nThe 2024 edition of the MLC is scheduled to begin from July 5, a week after the T20 World Cup concludes.

The Board have also planned on extending the number of teams from six to ten by the 2025 season of the competition.\n\nREAD MORE: Team India's 2024 T20 World Cup schedule\n\nChief Executive of the MLC, Vijay Srinivasan revealed the plan of extending the number of teams to The Guardian. Srinivasan stated “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that's our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, and will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding”\n\nSrinavasn also mentioned that they would be planning to kick start the season earlier from next season onwards. The plan would be to start the IPL early in June, a few weeks after the end of the IPL season."

        "body": "The league is also planning to expand from the current six teams to 10 in the coming seasons\n\nESPNcricinfo staff\n\n27-May-2024\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC), the season-old T20 tournament in the USA, has become the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire List A status from the ICC, following on from the UAE's ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThe status means that MLC will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics. \"We are really excited for the news as it's a recognition of the standard and high quality of players taking part in the tournament,\" tournament director Justin Geale told ESPNcricinfo. \"By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale.\n\n\"The most important part for me though is it ensures the performances of some of the world's best players alongside their peers are adequately reflected in their career statistics.\n\n\"Really thankful to the ICC for taking the time to look at it as cricket in the USA doesn't always fit into a template. We are an Associate nation and proud of that, one with a unique opportunity in front of us. It's our hope that on the back of the upcoming World Cup and a successful season we can continue to build a platform for the sport to grow and ultimately succeed in the USA.\"\n\nThe 2024 edition of MLC will start on July 5, a week after the T20 World Cup ends on June 29 in Bridgetown. The T20 World Cup begins, however, in Dallas, USA on June 1, in what is an important season in the game's continuing efforts to crack the US market.\n\nThe Guardian, which reported on the awarding of List A status on Monday, also revealed MLC's plans to expand from the current six teams to 10 over the next few years, jumping from 19 games in 2023 to 34 by 2025. Twenty-five games have already been scheduled for this season.\n\n\"It was always intended to be a 10-team league,\" MLC's chief executive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the Guardian. \"Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that's our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.\"\n\nSrinivasan said they wanted the league, which clashes with the Hundred in 2024, to start in early June in 2025.\n\n\"Ultimately for us, our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,\" Srinivasan said. \"With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That's how we would like to establish our window.\"\n\nAn early June start avoids a clash with the Hundred's July-August window, but it could mean an overlap with the T20 Blast. This scheduling clash became a major talking point in the last English summer when Jason Roy opted out of his ECB contract to play in the MLC and went on to represent LA Knight Riders, who have the same owners as that of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), who won their third IPL title on Sunday.\n\nLast year, MLC ended two days before the start of the Hundred, though this time there will be an overlap of six days between the two leagues, with the MLC ending on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. As a result, as many as half of the overseas players in the Hundred could arrive in the UK late after the MLC ends. Twelve out of the 24 overseas players under contract in the men's Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in MLC and more could follow before the tournament starts.\n\nFour of the six teams in the MLC are owned by IPL team owners - Mumbai Indians, KKR, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals.\n\nThe first season ran from July 13 to 31 with 15 group-stage games followed by four playoff matches, and ended with MI New York lifting the trophy under the captaincy of Nicholas Pooran. The second season will be played across the same two grounds which hosted the first season - the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and the Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville."

The MLC announced it will be expanding to an 8 team tournament within the space of two seasons and add two more to make it a 10 team franchise tournament eventually. The first season was played out in a single round robin format within 6 teams consisting of 19 games in a 3 week window.\n\nWhile the second season will see an increase of 6 games, the league is further expected to grow with a home and away format in the future. In a 10 team league, the actual number of games are set to spike up to close to 100 games.\n\nIn a major shot in the arm for the MLC, the ICC put its weight behind this $120m fledgling league by imparting a List A status to its games. Inherently, all domestic T20 games in associate nations are left bereft of the List A status but ICC's approval for the List A status is an endorsement of the quality of cricket at display at the inaugural season of the MLC.\n\n\"We saw cricket mania sweep across the US last year off the back of our inaugural season of Major League Cricket. Now, we take exciting momentum into the highly anticipated ICC T20 World Cup and season two of the MLC\" said Vijay Srinivasan CEO of MLC\n\n\"With an unforgettable summer of cricket on our doorstep, we're ready to capture the hearts of American sports fans with our thrilling, adrenaline-charged game that is the most exciting emerging T20 tournament across the globe\" added Srinivasan.\n\nThe prospects of MLC propelling itself to be a 10 team tournament is seen as a bit unsettling to the English game. In its full glory MLC, may ultimately carve out a 10 week window for itself to accommodate the home and away format for all of its 10 teams. As it stands, the MLC is well placed in a buffer between the IPL and the Hundred in the cricket calendar. With American and English summers overlapping, there is a high chance the MLC and competitions like the Blast and Hundred duel it out to attract and reserve top talent within their windows.\n\nMeanwhile, the American cricketing juggernaut has rolled along quietly on and off the field. The success of the inaugural season of the MLC has stimulated sponsorship from industry leaders like Cognizant and Stake. It is understood that the title sponsor Cognizant has pledged in close to $2m for the upcoming season. Furthermore, the USA men's historic series win over Bangladesh in the build up to their first world cup augurs well for American cricket, which finds itself in the midst of a T20 revolution.\n\n© Cricbuzz"

The List A status validates the MLC’s efforts in establishing a top-tier T20 competition in the USA.

More importantly, this recognition ensures that the achievements of players in the MLC will be reflected accurately in their official statistics.\n\nExpansion Plans and Scheduling Ambitions\n\nBuilding on this momentum, the MLC has ambitious plans for expansion. The league currently features six teams, but according to MLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan, this will grow to ten teams over the next few years. This expansion will be accompanied by an increase in matches, from 19 in 2023 to 34 by 2025.\n\nSrinivasan also revealed the league’s ideal calendar window. He envisions an early June start, coinciding with the conclusion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the beginning of US school holidays. This timeframe would allow the MLC to establish its own window without directly conflicting with the Hundred, a rival T20 league played in England and Wales.\n\nPotential Scheduling Conflicts and Overlap with the Hundred\n\nHowever, the MLC’s desired June start might create some overlap with the English T20 Blast competition. A similar scheduling conflict arose last year when England’s Jason Roy opted to play in the MLC instead of fulfilling his contract with the ECB. This situation highlights the complexities of scheduling multiple T20 leagues across the globe.\n\nThe upcoming season will see a six-day overlap with the Hundred, with the MLC concluding on July 28th and the Hundred starting on July 23rd. This overlap could potentially impact the availability of overseas players who might be participating in both leagues. Significantly, twelve out of the twenty-four overseas players currently contracted with the Hundred have already played or are signed up to play in the MLC.\n\nStrong Foundation with IPL Backing\n\nFour of the six MLC franchises are owned by established IPL teams – Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals. This strong backing from experienced IPL ownership groups provides the MLC with a solid foundation for growth and development.\n\nThe inaugural MLC season, held in July 2023, saw MI New York emerge victorious under the captaincy of Nicholas Pooran. The upcoming season will be played across the same two venues as the first – Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.\n\nWith List A status and ambitious expansion plans, Major League Cricket is poised to play a significant role in the development of American cricket. The coming season promises exciting competition and strategic manoeuvring as the MLC carves its own niche in the ever-evolving T20 landscape."

Plans are in place to grow from the current six teams to ten over the next few years, with a corresponding increase in matches from 19 to 34 by 2025.\n\nMLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan also revealed their ideal calendar would involve an earlier June start, potentially capitalizing on the American school holidays and avoiding clashes with other major leagues. However, this could lead to some overlap with England’s T20 Blast.\n\nAlarm bells for ECB, CA\n\nWith several MLC teams owned by IPL franchises, there’s a chance of player overlap with England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) owned The Hundred, another T20 league starting in late July. As many as half of the Hundred’s overseas players might arrive late due to their MLC commitments.\n\nThe Cricket Australia (CA) will also be looking at this development regarding MLC with sharp eyes as USA’s T20 league will be direct competitor of CA’s Big Bash League (BBL) in future.\n\nBright Future for cricket in USA\n\nDespite these potential scheduling hurdles, the MLC’s List A status and ambitious expansion plans are positive signs for the growth of cricket in the USA. The upcoming season promises more high-quality cricket and paves the way for a more established American T20 league in the years to come."

        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA is expanding rapidly, and this could be a problem for English cricket. MLC started small with a 19-game season, but they are planning to nearly double the number of games by 2025.\n\nThey are also adding more teams and getting important recognition from cricket’s governing body. Currently, a total of six teams participate in Major League Cricket, out of which four are acquired by the owners of Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals.\n\nExpanding Major League Cricket is a big deal because it just got a major upgrade – their matches will now be considered important official games. This attracts better players and more attention. Plus, MLC has powerful investors, including people behind the famous Indian Premier League.\n\nMLC wants their season to start in June, which overlaps with England’s key T20 Blast competition. This could mean English teams lose players who are tempted by the money and prestige of the US-based tournament.\n\nEngland is considering allowing private investment in their new Hundred tournament, similar to MLC. But decisions are slow, and MLC’s success might push England to act faster.\n\nOverall, MLC’s growth is good news for cricket fans in the US, but it could make things tougher for English cricket in the long run."

        "body": "Major League Cricket has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the US. In a move that will have significant implications for the landscape of professional sport in England, MLC, which started with a 19-match season, has confirmed it will expand to 34 matches by 2025. The league currently includes six franchises, but plans to have two more in the near future, and two more soon after. The announcement comes just after MLC was fully legitimized by the news that its matches have been granted List A status by the International Cricket Council.\n\n“It was always intended to be a 10-team league,” MLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan told The Guardian. “Research shows that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support ten teams, so that is our plan. We had 19 games in our first season and will have 25 in our second. I think we want to go to 34 next year and just gradually expand further.” The second season, which starts at the end of the World T20, lasts 23 days and overlaps with the Hundred. Next year’s edition will last considerably longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC would like to play in June.\n\n“Ultimately, our ideal calendar for us is to start much earlier, in late spring or early summer,” Srinivasan said. The tournament was postponed this year due to the Men’s T20 World Cup, which uses the MLC Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas. “With the Indian Premier League ending at the end of May, I think our best bet would be to start in early June, when we have the school holidays in the US, and then start in July. This is how we would like to decorate our shop window.” That would clash with the T20 Blast season, but the Hundred would run from late July to August.\n\nEnglish cricket has already had to adapt to sharing the summer with a rival league. Last year, Jason Roy gave up his England contract so he could take a job with the LA Knight Riders, while Surrey’s Sunil Narine skipped Surrey’s appearance on Blast final day as he also played for LA. Surrey’s director of cricket, Alec Stewart, said at the time that it was “disappointing and frustrating” to “lose a player of Narine’s quality late on”. Narine’s decision was a sobering reminder of the status of English domestic cricket.\n\nThe MLC’s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed this was the “direction of travel” for the match on May 10, but there is frustration at the slow progress. MLC boasts a formidable array of investors, including four IPL sides – the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Mumbai Indians, the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi Capitals – as well as key business people such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n“All these people who came to us when we started five years ago have been hugely successful in other walks of life,” Srinivasan said. switch. The expectation was never that this would be an overnight transition. They have been extremely patient and supported us all the way.” MLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local players. Work is now underway to develop more List A sites.\n\n“We are not here to play a league and go away every year,” Srinivasan added. “We feel like our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think in ten years you will see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of locations across the country, we’ll have a sort of home and away format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger player pool in the system as a result. Hopefully this means we’ll have a very strong kind of American team as well. Those are all our ambitions.”"
