        "text": "**Expansion Plans:** MLC has announced plans to expand from a 19-match season to 34 matches by 2025, with the ultimate goal of becoming a 10-team league. The league currently has six franchises, but plans to add two more in the near future, and two more soon after.\n\n**List A Status:** MLC matches have been granted List A status by the International Cricket Council (ICC), further legitimizing the league.\n\n**Season Schedule:** The second season will start at the end of the World T20 and overlap with the Hundred. The goal is to start the season earlier, in late spring or early summer, potentially in June.\n\n**Impact on English Cricket:** The expansion of MLC is likely to increase pressure on English cricket to decide whether to bring private investment into the Hundred, a rival league.\n\n**Investors and Infrastructure:** MLC boasts a strong array of investors, including four IPL sides and key business people. The league has established academies and a minor league system to develop local players and is working to develop more List A sites.\n\n**Long-term Ambitions:** MLC aims to build a robust infrastructure for cricket in the US, with a home and away format, a larger player pool, and a strong American team."

        "text": "**Expansion Plans:** MLC plans to expand its season from 19 matches to 34 matches by 2025, with an intermediate step of 25 matches in the second season. The league currently has six franchises, but aims to add two more in the near future and another two soon after, eventually reaching its goal of 10 teams.\n\n**Schedule:** The second season will start at the end of the Men's T20 World Cup and will last 23 days, overlapping with the Hundred. The ideal calendar for MLC is to start in late spring or early summer, with a goal to start in early June and last longer than the current season.\n\n**Impact on English Cricket:** MLC's expansion plans may increase pressure on English cricket to consider private investment in the Hundred, which could lead to a rival league. English cricket has already had to adapt to sharing the summer with a rival league, as seen with players like Jason Roy and Sunil Narine choosing to play in the MLC instead of English domestic cricket.\n\n**Investment and Infrastructure:** MLC boasts a strong array of investors, including four IPL teams and key businesspeople like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. The league has established academies and a minor league system to develop local players and is working to develop more List A sites."
