        "body": "Los Angeles Knight Riders have roped South African big-hitter David Miller for the upcoming season of the Major League Cricket. LAKR, the sister franchise of IPL champions KKR, finished last in 2023, having just won one game out of their 5 matches and failed to reach the playoffs.\n\nMiller comes in as a big signing for LAKR, as he played for Texas Super Kings, the sister franchise of CSK. LAKR made the move official on their social media platforms on May 30, Thursday. Miller's move to the Los Angeles-based franchise comes days after they had brought in veteran Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan to the team.\n\nMiller had a hot and cold IPL 2024 campaign with GT this year as the former champions had a season to forget. Miller's time with the team was marred by injuries as he missed a lot of crucial matches and wasn't in the best form after his injury.\n\nMiller scored just 210 runs in 9 matches for Gujarat at an average of 35 with one fifty to his name. GT would end up missing out on reaching the Playoffs this season and finished 8th in the table.\n\nLAKR's squad so far\n\nAhead of the new season of MLC, LAKR have made some big moves as they look to reach the Playoffs. The Los Angeles-based side had already retained the likes of Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Spencer Johnson and Adam Zampa.\n\nFrom the domestic side of things, Saif Badar, Unmukt Chand, Ali Khan, Nitish Kumar and Shadley Van Schalkwyk were retained. Ali Khan has been a fixture of the Knight Riders franchise and plays for them in the CPL with the Trinbago Knight Riders.\n\nChand returns to LAKR after missing out on selection to the USA squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup.\n\nDuring the domestic draft, LAKR added Adithya Ganesh, Corné Dry, Derone Davis and Matthew Tromp to the team. LAKR will start their campaign in MLC season 2 against TSK on July 5."

The hard-hitting left-hander joins the Knights after a good season with Texas Super Kings in the 2023 edition.\n\nIn the opening match of the 2023 season, Miller's fifty helped set up a 69-run win for the Super Kings over the Knight Riders. The 34-year-old has scored over 10,000 runs in his illustrious T20 career, with a blistering strike rate of 138.37.\n\nAdding Miller to the batting order for the Knight Riders was a no-brainer after they finished dead last in 2023 with just a single win. His ability to clear the ropes and dominate in the death overs could be the difference maker in this season.\n\nMiller joins a core of retained international players that includes Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Adam Zampa, and Spencer Johnson. This group had a poor season in the inaugural MLC season under Narine's captaincy.\n\nAlso read: Rashid, Klaasen, Pooran, Boult among 23 overseas retentions\n\nLos Angeles to face Texas Super Kings in their first game\n\nA new skipper could be a possibility to provide fresh leadership and allow Narine to focus solely on his bowling and explosive batting.\n\nRegardless, LA Knight Riders' sister franchise the Kolkata Knight Riders lifted their third IPL title in the recently concluded 2024 edition. Russell and Narine had a big role to play in KKR lifting the title, and they would be confident to do so in the upcoming edition of MLC.\n\nAlso read: ICC gives official List A status to Major League Cricket ahead of second season\n\nThe Los Angeles-based side will kick off their MLC 2024 campaign against Miller's former franchise, Texas Super Kings."

        "body": "The U.S. cricket team which will co-host the Twenty20 World Cup may be a fitting cross-section of its country as a roster of migrants, a melting pot of nationalities and cultures.\n\nThe 15-man squad includes players born in India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa. Home-grown players include vice-captain Aaron Jones, who was born in Queens, and allrounder Steven Taylor, of Hialeah, Florida.\n\nThe team provides a snapshot of U.S. cricket at this formative stage, as Major League Cricket jostles for its place in a crowded sporting market. The squad includes foreign players drawn to America by the MLC and local players given the chance to play cricket at a professional level in the United States\n\nThe home team's most recognized member is the former New Zealand allrounder Corey Anderson. The 33-year-old Anderson played 13 tests, 49 one-day internationals and 31 T20 internationals for New Zealand between 2013 and 2018 in a career limited by injuries.\n\nHe earned a place in cricket history for his 36-ball century in a one-day international between New Zealand and the West Indies on New Year’s Day, 2014. Anderson also has played in T20 leagues in Australia, India, the Caribbean and United Arab Emirates before finding an MLC home at the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nAnderson made his first half-century for the U.S. in its T20 win over Canada last month.\n\nMumbai-born Harmeet Singh, who played for India at two Under-19 World Cups, was the star for the 19th-ranked U.S. team earlier this week in an upset win over Bangladesh. It the only the second win over a full ICC member for the U.S.\n\nHe scored 33 from the 13 deliveries he faced and shared an unbeaten, match-winning 62-run partnership with Anderson, who was unbeaten on 34.\n\n“It means a lot to us to put on a show against Bangladesh. We are no walkovers,” Harmeet told ESPNcricinfo. “I think our potential is immense.”\n\nThe U.S. meets Canada in the tournament opener on June 1 and then there'll be a step up for both teams in Group A, which also includes India and Pakistan, fierce cricket rivals with enormous support, and Ireland.\n\nAmong the other foreign-born players on the U.S. squad coached by ex-Australia batter Stuart Law is right-arm fast bowler Ali Khan, who moved with his parents from Pakistan to the United States when he was 18.\n\nHe first played for the U.S. team in 2016 and has also has played in the Indian Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and Pakistan Premier League, in Global T20 Canada and the Afghanistan Premier League.\n\nCaptain Monank Patel, a wicketkeeper-batsman, was born in India and settled in New Jersey after moving permanently to the U.S. in 2016. He played at a junior level for Gujarat in India and played the first of his 47 one-day internationals and 23 T20 internationals for the U.S. in 2019.\n\nAndries Gous, another wicketkeeper-batsmen, was born in Welkom, South Africa, played for South Africa at under-19 level and played 60 first-class matches before relocating to the U.S. in 2021. He and Patel were the highest scorers for the U.S. in the recent five-match series against Canada.\n\nAllrounder Milind Kumar is another India-born player who accumulated nine centuries in 60 first-class appearances for Delhi before making his home in the U.S.\n\nThe Canada team scheduled to meet the U.S. in the opening match is also a team drawn from many places and shaped by the evolution of a professional league at home.\n\nCanada will be led by the veteran left-armer spinner Saad bin Zafar, who was born in Pakistan. He moved to Canada to study and was first named in the Canadian T20 team in 2008. Now 37, he has played 38 T20 internationals and once took two wickets without conceding a run in four overs in a T20 against Panama.\n\nJamaica-born batter Aaron Johnson, Pakistan-born left-arm fast bowler Kaleem Sana and Guyana-born right-arm quick Dillon Heyliger reflect the international makeup of the team which is coached by former Sri Lanka international Pubudu Dassanayake.\n\n___\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket\n\nSteve Mcmorran, The Associated Press"

        "date": "",
        "body": "USA's flagship T20 tournament, Major League Cricket (MLC) is eyeing a possible expansion to 10 teams. The MLC announced it will be expanding to an 8 team tournament within the space of two seasons and add two more to make it a 10 team franchise tournament eventually. The first season was played out in a single round robin format within 6 teams consisting of 19 games in a 3 week window.\n\nWhile the second season will see an increase of 6 games, the league is further expected to grow with a home and away format in the future. In a 10 team league, the actual number of games are set to spike up to close to 100 games.\n\nIn a major shot in the arm for the MLC, the ICC put its weight behind this $120m fledgling league by imparting a List A status to its games. Inherently, all domestic T20 games in associate nations are left bereft of the List A status but ICC's approval for the List A status is an endorsement of the quality of cricket at display at the inaugural season of the MLC.\n\n\"We saw cricket mania sweep across the US last year off the back of our inaugural season of Major League Cricket. Now, we take exciting momentum into the highly anticipated ICC T20 World Cup and season two of the MLC\" said Vijay Srinivasan CEO of MLC\n\nThe prospects of MLC propelling itself to be a 10 team tournament is seen as a bit unsettling to the English game. In its full glory MLC, may ultimately carve out a 10 week window for itself to accommodate the home and away format for all of its 10 teams. As it stands, the MLC is well placed in a buffer between the IPL and the Hundred in the cricket calendar. With American and English summers overlapping, there is a high chance the MLC and competitions like the Blast and Hundred duel it out to attract and reserve top talent within their windows.\n\nMeanwhile, the American cricketing juggernaut has rolled along quietly on and off the field. The success of the inaugural season of the MLC has stimulated sponsorship from industry leaders like Cognizant and Stake. It is understood that the title sponsor Cognizant has pledged in close to $2m for the upcoming season. Furthermore, the USA men's historic series win over Bangladesh in the build up to their first world cup augurs well for American cricket, which finds itself in the midst of a T20 revolution."

        "body": "Women's cricket could soon have a potential women's T20 franchise tournament in the United States. While still in the early stages, influential stakeholders in American cricket seem keen to capitalize on the unique window of opportunity presented. This is due to the country's hosting of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the recent success of the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) men's T20 tournament.\n\nWith cricket set to make its Olympic debut in 2028 and the USA women's national team likely to qualify as hosts, there is a growing realization of the need to develop the women's game domestically. The remarkable rise of the Women's Premier League (WPL) in India, where stars worldwide earned good salaries, has further highlighted the commercial potential of women's T20 cricket.\n\nWhile the project is still in the talking stage, the proposed tournament would aim to attract the world's best players and potentially operate alongside the existing men's franchises in the MLC.\n\nSeveral MLC franchise owners, including the Ambani family that owns MI New York, have expressed interest in developing women's teams. This move could significantly boost the profile and earning potential of women's cricketers globally.\n\nAlso read: Threat looms over marquee event as weather destroys facilities to cancel USA-Bangladesh warm up fixture\n\nUSA to host its first ICC event\n\nIf the plans materialize, it could have far-reaching implications for the international commitments of England's women cricketers and their participation in domestic tournaments like The Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has already taken steps to increase earnings for its domestic women's players, but compared to the offers in the WPL, there is still less.\n\nLaunching a women's T20 franchise league in the USA would mark a significant milestone for the game. It would provide a platform for the world's best talent to showcase their skills and potentially inspire a new generation of American women cricketers.\n\nAlso read: Stuart Law opens up on USA's historic series win over Bangladesh\n\nIn the past few years, USA Cricket has pushed the ranks and established itself in cricket. Interestingly, the upcoming ICC men's T20 World Cup 2024 will be the first ICC event hosted in America."
