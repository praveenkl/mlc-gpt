        "title": "Ponting hopeful of IPL return, predicts Delhi Capitals’ new coach | Major League Cricket, 2024",
        "date": "Fri Aug  9 08:48:06 2024",
        "body": "Former Delhi Capitals (DC) head coach Ricky Ponting is hopeful of returning to the Indian Premier League (IPL) as a coach. Ponting, who recently won his first trophy as coach in nine years with the Washington Freedom in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024, was ousted by the Capitals in July this year.\n\nSpeaking at the ICC Cricket Review, the three-time World Cup winner said, “I'd love to coach again in the IPL.”\n\n“There could be a few opportunities for me popping up in the next couple of months, and I'd love to be back coaching in the IPL again next season,” he said.\n\nStating that he had a great time every year at the richest cricket league in the world, both as a player and a coach, the Aussie said, \"I've had seven seasons at Delhi, which unfortunately didn't work out the way that I would have wanted and certainly the way that the franchise would have wanted.”\n\n“I think going there was all about trying to bring some silverware to the team, and that didn't happen,” he added.\n\nWhy did Ponting not commit to Delhi’s different approach?\n\nPonting, who had previously won the IPL with MI, said that he did not want to commit to the Capitals' new approach. \"They made it pretty clear that they wanted to head in a different direction with someone that could give them a bit more time and a bit more availability through the off-season. I just couldn't do that with the other stuff that I've got going on,\" said the 49-year-old.\n\nThe Tasmanian further predicted that the Delhi side might go with an Indian coach in the next season. \"I think what you'll find is that they'll probably end up with an India-based head coach. Certainly, that's some of the dialogue that I've had with them anyway,” he said."

        "body": "Legendary Australian batter and World Cup-winning captain Ricky Ponting recently parted ways with the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He then took on the role of head coach for Washington Freedom and led them to victory in the Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nWhile Ponting remains enthusiastic about coaching in the IPL and other leagues, he is not currently interested in taking on a role with any international team. Instead, he is keen to continue his association with an IPL franchise.\n\n“I’d love to coach again in the IPL,” he stated, as quoted by ICC.\n\nThe legendary batter, Ricky Ponting ruled out the possibility of taking up the job as England men’s team white-ball coach following departure of Matthew Mott, saying that international cricket jobs are not for him considering where he is at in his life right now.\n\nPonting turned down approaches from England to coach their Test side prior to Kiwi Brendon McCullum accepting the job, and the Australia legend recently finished a seven-year tenure in charge of the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League, as per ICC.\n\nHe reflected on his time in the IPL, recalling his playing days and his subsequent coaching stint with the Mumbai Indians. During his coaching tenure, he played a key role in helping the team win the title in 2015.\n\nMUST READ: Mumbai Hijab Row: SC Stays Implementation Of Hijab Ban At College ‘Will You…\n\n“I’ve had a great time every year that I’ve been involved, whether that was in the early days as a player or the couple of years I had at Mumbai as head coach there.\n\nAnd then I’ve had seven seasons at Delhi, which unfortunately didn’t really work out the way that I would have wanted and certainly the way that the franchise would have wanted. I think me going there was all about trying to bring some silverware to the team and that didn’t happen,” Ricky Ponting said.\n\nPonting reflected on his seven seasons with Delhi, noting that things didn’t turn out as well as he or the franchise had hoped.\n\nHe explained that his aim in joining the team was to win a title, but he was unable to achieve that goal.\n\nHe expects that Delhi will appoint someone local for the head coach position.\n\n“They made it pretty clear that they wanted to head in a different direction with someone that could give them a bit more time and a bit more availability through the off-season, really more than anything to be able to spend a bit more time in India with a lot of the local players.\n\nI just couldn’t do that with the other stuff that I’ve got going on,” the former world champion said.\n\n“But I’m really thankful for my time that I had there, met some great people, worked with some great people and obviously worked with some great players through the years as well.\n\nEver since Ponting’s appointment as a coach in 2018, when the franchise was called Delhi Daredevils, Delhi qualified for the playoffs thrice, in 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\nIn fact, in the 2020 season, DC made it to the finals for the first-time ever, but lost to the Mumbai Indians (MI).\n\nHowever, for the last three years, DC has failed to progress to the final four stages.\n\nThis year, the franchise finished in the sixth spot, narrowly missing out on the playoffs on the basis of net-run-rate. They won and lost seven matches this year.\n\nWITH INPUTS FROM ANI"

        "date": "Fri Aug  9 17:26:53 2024",
        "body": "With England’s white-ball coach Matthew Motts stepping down from his position before the end of his tenure, a few speculations grew on whether the former Australian captain Ricky Ponting would be interested in the role in making a partnership with the captain of the side, Jos Buttler.\n\nThe Tasmania-born parted ways with Delhi Capitals (DC) a few weeks ago in the Indian Premier League (IPL), before winning the second season of the Major League Cricket (MLC) in 2024 guiding the Washington Freedom, as he worked in a successful partnership with Australia’s Steve Smith, the former captain of the national side.\n\nRicky Ponting, however, turned down the approaches from the England Cricket Board (ECB) to coach their Test side before the former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum accepted the proposal. But the future is expected to be exciting in his coaching.\n\nRicky Ponting in talks with IPL teams to be new head coach\n\nIn the recent episode of the ICC review with host Sanjana Ganesan, Ricky Ponting revealed his wish not to consider the white-ball coaching of the England team, as he is looking forward to being part of the IPL and other various leagues around the world in coaching frame.\n\nAlso Read: India Seen As Potential Venue For Women’s T20 World Cup 2024 Due To Unrest In Bangladesh\n\n“No, I wouldn’t ever consider doing that. I’m on record saying that international jobs for me right now are not really where my life is at as there’s just so much more time taken up with an international job.” The former Australian captain expressed to ICC.\n\nThe veteran touched on the importance of balancing his time being at home, doing the commentary work, and being part of the team in the coaching role. He is going to be in the commentary box when Australia tours England in the upcoming white-ball series.\n\n“I‘ve got other commitments as well, with my TV work and things that I do and also trying to balance that out with having a decent amount of home time, which I haven’t had much of the last couple of years anyway.” The former Australian head coach Ricky Ponting shared his thoughts. “Coaching other international teams is one thing, coaching England for an Australian is probably something slightly different, but right now there’s sort of enough on my plate as I’ve got a bit more coming up in the next couple of months in the UK.”\n\nThe 49-year-old is looking forward to being part of another franchise in the IPL, and it could be Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), who lost their head coach Gautam Gambhir, who became the new coach for the Indian team.\n\n“I‘d love to coach again in the IPL. I’ve had a great time every year that I’ve been involved, whether that was in the early days as a player or the couple of years I had at Mumbai as head coach there.” Ricky Ponting remarked during the interaction. “And then I’ve had seven seasons at Delhi, which unfortunately didn’t work out the way that I would have wanted and certainly the way that the franchise would have wanted.”\n\nAlso Read: Former Bangladesh Captain Mashrafe Mortaza’s House Set On Fire For This Reason\n\nHe spent nearly seven seasons with the Capitals and felt that the franchise could aim to go in a different direction by looking to hire a local for the position."

        "body": "In the World Cup 2023 final, Australia defeated India at home thanks to a game-winning knock by Travis Head, which crushed many Indian hearts. When the Australian arrived at Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL 2024 with all guns blazing, the same Indians welcomed him with open arms.\n\nHead, who has lately spent the most of his time in India, spoke candidly about Indian culture during his first Major League Cricket match. The World Cup 2023 final saw a resounding turnout of Indian fans, who were also cheering Head on both on and off the pitch when he was wearing an orange SRH shirt and scoring at a strike rate of about 200.\n\n“The friendliness of people, the quality of our accommodations, and the way we are taken care of are the things I appreciate most about India. In addition to some incredible dining and sightseeing options, there are a few excellent golf courses nearby. We’re really lucky to be well taken care of when we’re there, Head stated, as cited by Sports Boom.\n\nWhile the audiences and locations we play in are undoubtedly fantastic, we also have time to relax and enjoy ourselves outside of the game. He continued, “Being in India is always a terrific experience.\n\nadore my time spent here in the first year of the MLC: Travis Head\n\nTaking part in his first MLC season, the 30-year-old will face off in the August 11 final. After returning to the Big Apple following the T20 World Cup in 2024, he was draughted by Washington Freedom and seems to have loved his time in the United States of America.\n\nAlso Read: Travis Head on ODI World Cup win over India in Ahmedabad: ‘People definitely had us as underdogs’\n\n“I enjoy spending my first year at MLC here. I’ve really loved meeting and playing with some local individuals, including Saurabh Netravalkar and Andries Goussé, but there are also some good overseas players for the Washington squad. It’s been really enjoyable this first year,” he said."
