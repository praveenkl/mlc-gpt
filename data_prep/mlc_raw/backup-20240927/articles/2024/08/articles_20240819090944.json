This decision was made to effectively manage his workload and provide him with an opportunity to focus on his physical conditioning in anticipation of a demanding summer ahead.\n\n\"Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it,\" Cummins told Fox Sports. \"I've basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer.\n\n\"It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, makes you less susceptible to injuries,\" he added.\n\nOver the past year, Cummins has had a hectic schedule. His engagements included an ODI series against India, the successful ODI World Cup campaign, three Test matches against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour in New Zealand, two Test matches against New Zealand, the Indian Premier League, the T20 World Cup held in the Caribbean, and the MLC tournament.\n\n\"I'm very sore today after a week of gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can't really nail it while you're in the midst of the season,\" the 31-year-old said.\n\n\"I'll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can't really fit in the middle of the season.\"\n\nThe upcoming edition of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy will feature five Test matches. Australia hav been unable to secure the trophy since 2017, as India have emerged victorious in four consecutive series. This includes their remarkable successes in Australia during the 2018-19 and 2020-21 tours.\n\nAs the captain, Cummins is determined to lead his team to victory and claim the trophy on home soil this season.\n\n\"It's the trophy I haven't won before... this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven't ticked off,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"We've achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\n\"That's what lies ahead of us this summer. They (India) are a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" he added.\n\nCummins has no intention of retiring from T20 cricket in the near future. He aspires to contribute to Australia's quest for the gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, which will feature cricket for the first time in the history of the quadrennial event.\n\n\"Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle,\" Cummins said. \"I'd love to be on that side (at LA 2028). I think I'll be 35 or something, so hopefully still there or thereabouts.\n\n\"Honestly, right now, it feels a long way away. Maybe once we get closer and start building into it, everyone gets a bit more excited,\" he concluded.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nKarisma Kapoor's look in a ruched dress will surely inspire you to go green this monsoon\n\nLifestyle\n\nHow to make Cheesy Garlic Bread Sticks with Pizza Base\n\nFood\n\nNazriya Nazim rocks a new short hair look\n\nEntertainment\n\nShruti Haasan dazzles as a fashion diva in every look\n\nEntertainment\n\n10 types of potatoes in India and which is the best\n\nFood\n\n​How to instill honesty in your child​\n\nLifestyle\n\nStunning off-screen appearances of 'Thiruchitrambalam' actress Nithya Menen\n\nEntertainment\n\nKanika Mann’s delightful desi looks\n\ntv\n\nAditi Shankar revolutionises ethnic fashion\n\nEntertainment"

        "body": "Australia’s Test captain, Pat Cummins, has announced an eight-week hiatus to recharge ahead of the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against India later this year.\n\nFresh off his debut stint in Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States, Cummins has chosen to rest and recuperate, opting out of next month's white-ball tour of the United Kingdom.\n\nThis decision is part of a strategic plan to manage Cummins' workload and ensure he is physically and mentally prepared for the challenging summer ahead. The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is of particular significance, as Australia has suffered back-to-back series defeats to India on home soil in 2018/19 and 2020/21.\n\nCummins believes that skipping the UK tour will allow him to address any lingering physical strains and return in peak condition, ready to lead Australia in what promises to be a critical series. \"Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher; you never regret it,\" Cummins told Fox Sports.\n\n\"I've basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer,\" he added.\n\n\"It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, and it makes you less susceptible to injuries.\"\n\nCummins also reflected on the significance of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a title that has eluded him throughout his career. \"It's the one trophy I haven't won before... this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven't ticked off,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"We've achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\"\n\nThe series against India holds special importance, not just for the Australian team but also for Cummins personally. During India’s last tour of Australia in 2020/21, the visitors staged a remarkable comeback. After a humiliating start in Adelaide, where India was bowled out for a mere 36 in the day/night Test, the series seemed headed for disaster.\n\nHowever, despite losing key players, including then-captain Virat Kohli, and fielding a makeshift bowling attack in the final Test, India clinched a 2-1 series victory.\n\nThe crowning achievement came at the Gabba, a venue where Australia had remained unbeaten since 1989.\n\nCummins, who was part of the Australian squad during that series, is determined to change the outcome this time around. \"They're a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" Cummins remarked."

You want to be part of it right there in the middle,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"I'd love to be on that side (at LA28). I think I'll be 35 or something, so hopefully still there or thereabouts.

        "body": "Australian Test captain Pat Cummins won’t pick up a cricket ball for the next eight weeks as he builds up his body ahead of this summer’s Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who recently returned from the United States following his maiden Major League Cricket campaign, was not selected for next month’s white-ball tour of the United Kingdom as Cricket Australia manages his workload ahead of another busy home summer.\n\nHaving been allocated a proper pre-season for the first time in several years, Cummins has shifted focus towards strength work, preparing his body for the highly-anticipated five-Test series against India that gets underway in late November.\n\nIf all goes to plan, the New South Welshman will be less susceptible to injury this summer, bowling longer spells while maintaining pace above 140km/h.\n\n“I’m very sore today after a week of gym,” Cummins told Fox Cricket.\n\n“Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can’t really nail it while you’re in the midst of the season.\n\n“I’ll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can’t really fit in the middle of the season.”\n\nWatch every ball of the England v Sri Lanka Test series LIVE & exclusive to Fox Cricket, available on Kayo.

Start your free trial today >\n\nThe past 12 months have been relentless for Cummins — after fracturing his wrist towards the end of the Ashes campaign in England, he has featured in an ODI series against India, the triumphant World Cup in the subcontinent, three Tests against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour of New Zealand, two Tests against the Black Caps, the Indian Premier League, the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the MLC tournament.\n\nCA identified the upcoming white-ball tour of Scotland and England as a rare opportunity for Cummins to freshen up and recharge the batteries ahead of a blockbuster home summer.\n\n“Everyone that comes back after a break and is a little bit fresher, you never regret it,” Cummins continued.\n\n“I’ve basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago.\n\n“This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer.\n\n“It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, make you less susceptible to injuries.”\n\nThe Border-Gavaskar Trophy, extended to five Tests this summer, has been in India’s possession since 2017, with the Asian powerhouse winning four consecutive series including historic triumphs on Australian soil in 2018/19 and 2020/21. Cummins only had one Test cap to his name the last time Australia lifted the coveted trophy.\n\nDespite everything the Australian men’s team has achieved over the past few years — including two World Cup wins and a World Test Championship title — Cummins acknowledged that India’s Test dominance was “the one blight” that needed to be resolved.\n\nCummins and his teammates can make amends this summer, while there are also precious World Test Championship points on the line.\n\n“It’s the trophy I haven’t won before … this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven’t ticked off,” Cummins said.\n\n“We’ve achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home.

We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we’re really well placed also.”\n\nCummins, who penned a multi-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns ahead of his maiden MLC campaign, claimed four wickets at 52.75 in six games during the American T20 tournament. He took 2-35 in the final against the Washington Freedom, which the Unicorns lost by 96 runs, removing national teammates Travis Head and Steve Smith.\n\n“It was fun, also a bit scary knowing how good they are,” Cummins laughed when asked about bowling to Smith and Head.\n\n“You can see why some of the oppositions scratch their heads at times, bowling at them when they’re in full flight.”\n\nThe prospect of watching Cummins and Smith lock horns in a Big Bash League Sydney derby in January next year is a mouth-watering prospect for Australian cricket fans.\n\nCummins has only played one BBL match in the last seven years, with international commitments repeatedly preventing the Sydney Thunder bowler from donning the lime green.\n\nThere’s a small window in January for Australia’s Test stars to play Big Bash cricket following the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, but Cummins confessed there was a “very, very slim” chance of him being available after five gruelling Test matches.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n‘DON’T KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON’: Smith opens up on T20 future\n\nWHITE-BALL UK TOUR: Injury-plagued Aussie quick ruled out\n\nMeanwhile, Cummins has no plans to retire from the game’s shortest format, hoping he can help Australia win gold at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\n“Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited.

The series will be particularly critical for the Aussies, as they have conceded successive series defeats to India at home (in 2018/19 and 2020/21).\n\n“Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it,” Cummins was quoted as saying by Fox Sports.\n\n“I’ve basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago.

        "body": "Australian cricketer Steve Smith, rejuvenated by his impressive showing in Major League Cricket (MLC), has set his sights on a return to the Indian Premier League (IPL) next year. Despite being overlooked for the T20 World Cup and the upcoming tours of Scotland and England, Smith’s recent form has reignited his ambitions.\n\nSteve Smith’s recent blitz in T20 Format\n\nSmith guided the Washington Freedom to their maiden MLC title. He finished the T20 tournament as the franchise’s equal leading run-scorer, amassing 336 runs at an impressive strike rate of 148.67.\n\nIn the final against the San Francisco Unicorns, Smith played a crucial role, scoring 88 runs off 52 balls. His innings included a battle against a formidable bowling attack featuring Australian captain Pat Cummins and Pakistan quick Haris Rauf. For this stellar performance, he was adjudged the player of the match.\n\nSmith expressed his desire for another opportunity in the IPL. Despite not featuring in the tournament since 2021, where he went unsold in the previous auctions, he remains optimistic. He stated, “I feel like in every opportunity I’ve had in T20 cricket recently and franchise stuff, I’ve played quite nicely. So hopefully, I just keep putting my name up there and enjoying it.”\n\nReflecting on his absence from international T20s, Smith acknowledged the selectors’ preference for younger players. He remains unfazed, focusing on personal improvement and growth. “I’ll just go about my business, keep trying to improve and get better,” he said.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of competing in the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, Smith remained open-minded. “Never say never,” he remarked, hinting at the distant yet intriguing prospect.\n\nSteve Smith’s resurgence in MLC has fueled his determination to make a triumphant IPL comeback. As cricket fans, we eagerly await his return to the grand stage, where his skill and experience can once again shine brightly."
