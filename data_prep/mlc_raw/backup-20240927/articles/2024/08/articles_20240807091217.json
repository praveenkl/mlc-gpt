        "date": "Sun May  1 08:38:39 2022",
        "body": "The Knight Riders Group (KRG), backed by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside actor Juhi Chawla and businessman Jay Mehta, is investing in a 10,000-capacity cricket stadium near Los Angeles.\n\nLocated at a 15-acre land parcel in Great Park, Irvine, Southern California, some 40 miles from downtown Los Angeles, the plan is driven by Major League Cricket (MLC). The org has revealed that an exclusive negotiating agreement with the city of Irvine to move forward with lease negotiations and design approvals has been approved. The investment in the stadium is likely to be in the range of $30 million, Variety understands.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nBollywood Superstar Shah Rukh Khan Teams With Hitmaker Rajkumar Hirani for 'Dunki'\n\nShane Warne, Australian Cricket Legend, Dies at 52\n\nBBC Studios Sets Content Deal With India's MX Player - Global Bulletin\n\nKRG are owners of the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the lucrative Indian Premier League cricket tournament and Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nThe stadium, which will have the capacity to be expanded, will be designed by architects HKS and will be home to MLC’s Southern California-based franchise, in the heart of one of the largest cricket-loving populations in the U.S., including an estimated 100,000 cricket fans with a further 200,000 more located in Los Angeles County. Two Minor League Cricket teams, the SoCal Lashings and Hollywood Master Blasters, along with local adult and youth leagues in the area provide a base of grassroots support for cricket in the region.\n\nThe stadium plans include state-of-the-art training facilities, locker rooms, luxury suites, dedicated parking, concessions, field lighting and an international-grade pitch to meet International Cricket Council (ICC) accreditation. There are two major events that the proposed stadium, if completed in time, could host – the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024, which will be co-hosted by the U.S. and the West Indies, and if cricket is included in the 2028 Olympic Games to be held in Los Angeles, which the ICC is bidding for. U.S.A Cricket is also expected to bid for future men’s and women’s World Cup tournaments.\n\n“Our investment in MLC in America is based on our belief in the exciting future of cricket in the U.S.A and is well aligned to our strategy of establishing Knight Riders as a global brand in T20 cricket,” said Khan, per an MLC press release. “Plans to build a world class cricket stadium in the greater Los Angeles area is exciting for us and MLC. This will no doubt have a transformational impact for cricket in one of the world’s most iconic metropolitan destinations.”\n\nSameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders, MLC, added: “Great Park’s position as a hub for community recreation and its array of first-class sports facilities makes it an ideal location for the addition of a venue serving the local cricket-loving community and the broader Greater Los Angeles region with major international cricket events set to take place there.”\n\nBest of Variety\n\nMolly Shannon's Memoir 'Hello Molly' Is Already an Instant Bestseller on Amazon\n\n2022 Primetime Emmys Awards Season Calendar: The Governors Balls are Back After Two Years\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney Plus in April 2022\n\nSign up for Variety’s Newsletter.

        "date": "Fri Aug  2 17:35:46 2024",
        "body": "Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf saw a fan troll him by reminding him about the Virat Kohli hit off his bowling in the 2022 edition of the T20 World Cup. The incident has been making the rounds of the internet and was from the recently concluded Major League Cricket in the USA. Playing for San Francisco Unicorns, Rauf picked up four wickets in nine games.\n\nComing back to the 2022 T20 World Cup, India and Pakistan had a thrilling matchup that went right down to the wire and saw Virat Kohli play one of the greatest knocks in T20I history. In this brilliant performance, Kohli hit two sixes against Rauf in the penultimate over the chase out which one has been deemed as the shot of the century.\n\n\"Melbourne abhi yaad aata hai...\" - Fan trolls Haris Rauf; asks if he remembers \"Virat ke 2 chakke\"\n\nReminding the Pakistani star of this moment, a fan called out at Haris Rauf as he was fielding at the boundary line. The fan was heard saying, \"Melbourne abhi bhi yaad aata hai? Virat ke 2 chakke\" (Do you remember Melbourne, Virat's 2 sixes). Responding to this, an annoyed Rauf just nodded his head and said yes.\n\nSpeaking about those sixes, Haris Rauf complimented Virat Kohli and described him as the only batter who can hit those shots. Rauf said, \"The way he [Kohli] played in the World Cup, that is his class, we all know the types of shots he plays. And the way he hit those sixes, I don't think any other player can hit a shot like that off my bowling. If Dinesh Karthik aur Hardik Pandya would've hit those sixes, I would've been hurting but those came off Kohli's bat and he is a different class altogether.\""

        "date": "Thu Aug  1 10:51:02 2024",
        "body": "Cricket\n\n-OneArabia\n\nBy OneArabia\n\nFinn Allen, the New Zealand international cricketer, made headlines with his impressive performance in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. The 25-year-old opener showcased his aggressive batting style, catching the attention of many cricket enthusiasts.\n\nDespite his remarkable performance in MLC 2024, where he scored 306 runs in nine matches at an average of 34, Allen did not attract any bids at the IPL 2024 auction. He had registered for the auction with a base price of INR 75 lakh. His strike rate of 187.73 was the highest in the tournament, making him a valuable asset for any T20 team.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad could greatly benefit from Allen's batting prowess. Known for their aggressive approach last season, which led to record-breaking totals, the Sunrisers might be keen to sign him. His ability to accelerate scoring could be a perfect fit for their strategy.\n\nThe Chennai Super Kings (CSK), five-time IPL champions, might also show interest in Allen. Their previous signing of Rachin Ravindra for INR 1.8 crore did not yield expected results as he struggled as an opener. CSK might consider offloading Ravindra and bringing in Allen to strengthen their lineup and improve their chances in powerplay overs.\n\nGujarat Titans, who won the IPL trophy in their debut season in 2022 but failed to qualify for playoffs in 2024, might look to sign quality players like Finn Allen. Adding him to their squad could enhance their performance and help them dominate future seasons.\n\nAllen's performance in MLC 2024 has undoubtedly strengthened his resume as an aggressive batter. Although he did not secure a spot in IPL 2024, his skills make him a sought-after player for upcoming auctions. Teams looking to boost their batting lineup will likely consider him a valuable addition.\n\nIn summary, Finn Allen's explosive batting style makes him an attractive option for several IPL teams. Sunrisers Hyderabad, Chennai Super Kings, and Gujarat Titans are among those who might pursue him in future auctions to bolster their squads and improve their chances of success.\n\nStory first published: Thursday, August 1, 2024, 10:51 [GST]"

        "date": "Sun Aug  4 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "Photo Credit: Instagram Photo of @gavaskarsunilofficial\n\nFormer Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has raised serious concerns following the conclusion of Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024). The Washington Freedom won the tournament, defeating the San Francisco Unicorns in the final at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nGavaskar, who was in the US as part of the broadcast team, witnessed drastic changes in MLC 2024. Despite featuring several international stars, he expressed disappointment over the league’s overall quality.\n\nThe former Indian captain noted a significant decline in MLC’s standards compared to its inaugural season and pointed out the poor crowd turnout for MLC 2024, which contrasted sharply with the enthusiastic attendance in the first edition.\n\nGavaskar has suggested a major overhaul to restore the tournament’s prestige, including imposing restrictions on players’ participation in other franchise T20 leagues to ensure higher competitive cricket and deliver world-class entertainment to fans.\n\nSunil Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar: “For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual.”\n\nGavaskar suggested limiting players to three T20 leagues worldwide to maintain high standards and competitiveness. He emphasized the IPL as the top league and recommended players choose two other leagues to participate in.\n\nHe added, “While nobody wants the players’ source of income to be curbed, I feel it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in three leagues of their choice. The IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So, the player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice.”\n\nGavaskar explained that players often compete for one IPL team while representing rival IPL teams in other T20 leagues. This is understandable if their IPL team isn’t in those leagues, but it’s odd to see players in rival IPL jerseys elsewhere."
