        "text": "**Match Preview**: The 8th match of Major League Cricket 2024 is set to take place between Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom on July 11 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\n**Recent Form**: Seattle Orcas have come off a convincing 9-wicket win against the Los Angeles Knight Riders, thanks to Ryan Rickelton's unbeaten 103 and Quinton de Kock's 51. Washington Freedom, on the other hand, had their match against Texas Super Kings abandoned due to rain, but Travis Head and Steven Smith had given them a strong start.\n\n** Probable Playing XI**: The likely playing XI for both teams has been predicted, with Heinrich Klaasen leading the Seattle Orcas and Steven Smith captaining the Washington Freedom.\n\n**Pitch and Weather Report**: The pitch at Grand Prairie Stadium is expected to favor pace bowlers, with a decent batting surface and some assistance for spin bowlers. The weather is expected to be cool and clear, with minimal chance of rain.\n\n**Head-to-Head Records**: This is the first match between Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom, so there are no head-to-head records to speak of."
