        "body": "Dallas [Texas], July 29 (ANI): In a spectacular display of power hitting and strategic bowling, Washington Freedom etched their name on the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 trophy with a massive 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in the championship final at Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nLed by a stellar performance from Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell, Freedom set an imposing target of 208, which proved too steep for the Unicorns to chase in the match on Sunday.\n\nIn need of a strong start, the Unicorns were immediately on the back foot. Jake Fraser-McGurk (3) was dismissed early in the third over, and Marco Jansen (3/28) struck a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen (13), who scored a century in the qualifier. With the score at 30/3, the Unicorns were in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued as Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) fell early, extinguishing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, who was brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, further tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then cleaned out the tail with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the ultimate match of the tournament, the team from Washington lost Head (9) early. Then, Steve Smith (88 in 52 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) took centre stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock.\n\nHe found support in Andries Gous (21 in 14 balls, with three fours and a six), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, finding the boundary with ease.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40 in 22 balls, with a four and four sixes) joined Smith and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as both Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith’s departure, followed shortly by Maxwell’s, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. The Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) beat San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs\n\nTOURNAMENT AWARDS:\n\nWINNERS: Washington Freedom\n\nRUNNERS-UP: San Francisco Unicorns\n\nMOST VALUABLE PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Travis Head (Washington Freedom): 336 runs in nine matches at an average of 48.00, strike rate of over 173 and five fifties.\n\nLEADING RUN SCORER: Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings): 420 runs in eight innings at an average of 52.50, with a strike rate of over 171 and a century and three fifties.\n\nLEADING WICKET TAKER: Saurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom): 15 wickets\n\nDOMESTIC PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Hassan Khan (San Francisco Unicorns): 204 runs in eight innings at an average of 40.80, with a fifty and 10 wickets."

        "body": "Smith, Maxwell and Head lead the charge for Washington, who lost just one game in MLC 2024\n\nWashington Freedom 207 for 5 (Smith 88, Maxwell 40) beat San Francisco Unicorns 111 (Ravindra 3-23, Jansen 3-28) by 96 runs\n\nSteven Smith led Washington Freedom to the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 title as they romped to an overwhelming 96-run victory against San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. Smith and Australia team-mate Glenn Maxwell dominated with the bat then Unicorns' chase disintegrated with Marco Jansen claiming both openers among his three wickets.\n\nThe result cemented Freedom's standing as the team of the season having secured five wins in the group stage before progressing direct to the final with victory over Unicorns in the Qualifier. This contest turned their way through a stand of 83 off 39 balls between Smith and Maxwell as Freedom added 121 in the second half of their innings.\n\nSmith, who was overlooked for Australia's T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, overcame a sluggish start in the powerplay to make 88 off 52 balls including six sixes. Having been 10 off 12 balls in the sixth over he sped to a 34-ball fifty and ended the season as the joint second-leading run-scorer, alongside Travis Head, with 336 at a strike-rate of 148.67.\n\nHead, who has struck at over 170 during the tournament, fell early to Pat Cummins when he edged to slip, where Finn Allen held on at the second attempt, having been given a life in the opening over. But Andries Gous gave Freedom's innings impetus as Smith found his feet although when Haris Rauf removed Rachin Ravindra after the midway mark, it was an even contest at 86 for 3.\n\nThen Smith and Maxwell, the latter having found form in the closing stages of the tournament, took charge included 28 coming off the 13th over from Juanoy Drysdale. Smith produced an outrageous scoop for six off Rauf and was in sight of a century when he got a top edge off Cummins.\n\nIt appears likely that Smith's T20I career is over following his World Cup omission and absence from the squad to face Scotland and England in September as the selectors look to the future, but it has been a profitable few weeks for him in the US.\n\nThough Maxwell also fell in the next over, superbly caught by Josh Inglis, Freedom were still able to cross 200.\n\nUnicorns' chase never got off the ground. Jake Fraser-McGurk's low-key tournament ended when he edged into the stumps against Jansen to leave him with 81 runs at 11.57 then both Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Allen also fell inside the powerplay to leave a daunting task. Sherfane Rutherford was superbly caught at deep backward square by Ian Holland the ball after being dropped and the rest of the batting fell away amid a huge asking rate.\n\nFreedom's victory gave Ricky Ponting a title as coach a couple of weeks after leaving his role with Delhi Capitals.\n\nAndrew McGlashan is a deputy editor at ESPNcricinfo"

Washington Freedom clinched the title as they defeated the San Francisco Unicorns in the final at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nGavaskar, who was in the US as part of the broadcast team for MLC 2024, was not impressed with the overall quality of the tournament.\n\nSunil Gavaskar Opines On Casual Attitude On Players In MLC\n\nSunil Gavaskar expressed disappointment over the league's quality and standards. His critical assessment highlighted potential issues within the tournament and suggested that despite the presence of renowned players, the competition did not meet the expectations set by its inaugural season.\n\n\"For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe, because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual,\" Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar.\n\nThe former Indian captain also highlighted the significant drop in crowd turnout for the tournament, which starkly contrasted with the enthusiastic attendance seen during the tournament's first edition.\n\n\"This makes one feel that while nobody wants the players’ source of income to be curbed, it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in, say, three leagues. The whole world agrees that the IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So maybe a player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice,\" he opined.\n\nGavaskar suggested that players should be limited to participating in only three T20 leagues in the world to maintain the high standards and competitiveness of the franchise tournaments."

        "body": "The Washington Freedom and the San Francisco Unicorns locked horns in the final of Major League Cricket (MLC) at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. Corey Anderson, the captain of the San Francisco Unicorns, won the toss and elected to bowl first. Despite losing the dangerous Travis Head early in the innings, Washington Freedom’s Steve Smith put on a show.\n\nHe scored 88 runs off 52 balls and kept the scoreboard ticking at one end. His Australia teammate, Glenn Maxwell stepped up and scored a quick cameo.\n\nMaxwell smashed 40 runs off 22 balls and took the Freedom’s score to 207/5 at the end of 20 overs. Steve Smith displayed his attacking shots as he smashed 7 fours and 6 sixes with a strike-rate of 169.23.\n\nIt was yet again that Smith stood up on yet another big night. Unicorns were all-out for 111 in just 16 overs and Washington Freedom won the game by 96 runs.\n\nSteve Smith was dropped from Australia’s T20 World cup 2024 squad\n\nSmith has been a legend in Test cricket and is one of the greatest batters ever produced in this format. However, he has not made his mark in the shortest format of the game for Australia. Smith has struggled to get going and hit his strides in T20I cricket. He has mainly struggled with his strike-rate and his ability to produce aggressive innings in this format. Smith even played as a opener but did not get going.\n\nIn the recent T20 World Cup 2024 in West Indies and USA, Smith was dropped from the Australian squad. Later in the tournament, Australia were knocked out of the Super 8 stage.\n\nSmith’s low strike rate and failure to play impact innings caused his exclusion from the Australian squad in the T20 World Cup 2024. However, he proved his mettle with stunning innings in the final of MLC which led his team to victory.\n\nIn case you have missed:"
