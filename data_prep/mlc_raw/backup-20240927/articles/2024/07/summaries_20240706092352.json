The team consists of experienced players like Pat Cummins, Matt Henry, and Liam Plunkett, with West Indian all-rounder Sherfane Rutherford being the star attraction.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders, affiliated with the Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders, had a poor first season, finishing last with a slender two-wicket defeat against the league winners Seattle Orcas.
