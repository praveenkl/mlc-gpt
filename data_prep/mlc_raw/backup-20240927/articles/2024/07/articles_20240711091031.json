        "date": "Wed Jul 10 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "For Major League Cricket organizers, the timing couldn’t be better.\n\nOn the heels of a T20 men’s cricket World Cup in which the American co-hosts scored a signature victory over Pakistan in the group stage, the domestic cricket league sees momentum for greater growth.\n\nMLC opens its second season July 5, six days after the World Cup final won by India. Organizers hope the United States’ success helps push the sport, and ultimately the league, more deeply into America’s sports consciousness.\n\n“Cricket has tried and failed in this country for probably 25, 30 years,” MLC director Justin Geale said. “This is the furthest anyone’s got, so we’ve got to keep that momentum going.”\n\nCricket’s global popularity may come as a shock to some American sports fans.\n\nIt is the most popular sport in India, the world’s most populous country, and enjoys similar appeal in parts of the Caribbean and countries such as England, South Africa and Australia. The Indian Premier League, the country’s top domestic T20 circuit, has grown into one of the world’s most lucrative leagues; and the sport, which is the second-most-watched in the world, will return to the Olympics in 2028 following a 128-year hiatus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious attempts to find a place for cricket in the American sports landscape haven’t worked out.\n\nShort-lived Pro Cricket operated an eight-team league in 2004. It aimed to capitalize on the advent of professional T20 cricket in the United Kingdom but folded after one season. (T20, or Twenty20, is a faster, shortened version of the sport.) The American Premier League, another T20 competition, failed to launch in 2009, though it finally got off the ground in 2021.\n\nMajor League Cricket debuted in July 2023. The league features six teams: from New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and Grand Prairie, Tex. (near Dallas), competing in the T20 format. Bolstered by $120 million in investment, those teams include some of the top players in the world who are able to play during their offseasons. Games have been contested only in Texas and North Carolina, but organizers say most of the funding will be used for building or upgrading eight venues across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir goal is to grow the sport in America, ideally beyond the South Asian diaspora. They said they don’t want to compete for sports supremacy with the NFL or the NBA. MLC aims to capitalize on burgeoning interest in cricket so the league can eventually become a more casual presence in American sports fans’ lives — and benefit from the more lucrative broadcast deals that expansive popularity invites.\n\nA promising first season outperformed the league’s expectations, with games selling out at the venue (capacity: 3,500) in Morrisville, N.C., outside Raleigh, and those in the stadium in Grand Prairie (capacity: 7,200) averaging more than 80 percent capacity. Saurabh Netravalkar, a breakout star at the World Cup, and other players said they were pleasantly surprised by the professionalism and quality of competition.\n\n“We learned an awful lot,” Geale said. “What’s most pleasing is it actually worked. You spend three years trying to plan and you theorize, but people actually came, so our crowds were really positive — and we didn’t help ourselves. We’re playing in Texas in the middle of summer.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe league’s priority now is building venues in other cities to connect with fans in those areas. It is a critical but ongoing challenge that could have teams relying on temporary facilities such as the one used in New York for the World Cup as they work to secure more permanent grounds.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas are developing a stadium east of the city in Redmond, Wash., and the San Francisco Unicorns are planning a Santa Clara venue the team hopes will become part of a larger sports and entertainment hub. The Washington Freedom was in negotiations with George Mason University to build a temporary baseball and cricket stadium on the Northern Virginia school’s west campus, but plans fell through in March after students and local residents opposed the project, and the university president later said it “does not meet the strategic objectives and interests of our campus and community and the Washington Freedom.” Franchises in New York and Los Angeles also are seeking stadiums.\n\nThat’s why teams play in North Carolina and Texas, though the league has mandated each team secure a home ground by 2028, when Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our biggest challenge is infrastructure. If we had more places to play, we’d go and play, so that’s holding back our growth,” Geale said. “We’re looking to build stadiums as quick as we can in all these areas. As soon as we can do that, I think we can grow quicker, the season can get longer; we can really talk to local fans and build a brand around, say, the Washington Freedom, rather than trying to do that over a distance.”\n\nFor players, that can mean little to no connection to their “home” city for the time being.\n\nLast season, Freedom players attended a preseason camp in the Dallas area a few weeks before the start of the season in July. The first half of their schedule was in Texas, the second half in North Carolina, then back to Dallas for the playoffs. Netravalkar plays for the Freedom while working as a software engineer for Oracle in the Bay Area. He said last year he only ventured east for MLC events in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhead of Year 2, some things will change.\n\nMLC games were broadcast in more than 80 countries last year and were shown via Sling TV and Willow TV, which streams overseas cricket events. Select games aired on CBS Sports Network. To expand coverage in 2024, MLC is negotiating partnerships with regional sports networks in its six cities. There will be six more matches on the schedule, up from 19. Teams such as the Freedom are considering how to engage their local fans from a distance — through clinics, meet-and-greets or contests where winners are flown out to watch games in person.\n\nDespite its stadium struggles, MLC is poised for expansion. Geale said it could add two teams by 2026 and is eyeing franchises in Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto, New Jersey and South Florida.\n\nMLC has a developmental minor league through which it is helping cultivate young domestic talent. Over time, the idea is for pro teams and their players to be more involved in their communities through coaching, mentorship and other forms of outreach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there is the development of the U.S. men’s and women’s national teams.\n\nThe men’s upset over 2022 T20 World Cup runner-up Pakistan last month helped them qualify for the tournament’s second round, called the Super Eight, where the team’s dream run ended. Still, its advancement means it automatically qualifies for the 2026 edition of the tournament hosted by India and Sri Lanka. Geale believes the success drives more attention to the sport and opens the door for the league to negotiate better broadcast opportunities.\n\nNetravalkar, a bowler for the U.S. national team, said MLC already has contributed to that effort.\n\n“I think Major League the first season really helped us because that gave us the platform to play on quality pitches within the U.S. and to sort of rub shoulders with some of the top cricketers across the globe in front of good crowds,” he said.\n\n“It’s really heartening to see that cricket has arrived,” he added. “We planted a seed for growth, and Major League being immediately after the World Cup helps a lot to continue that trajectory and make it even bigger.”"

        "body": "Perhaps the greatest six-hitter in T20s, West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell has proved his ability once again, with a stunning 107m six. Playing for Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) in USA's Major League Cricket (MLC), Russell hammered Pakistan's Haris Rauf for a towering 107m six in the final over of their innings. Russell's six and 15 runs off the 20th over helped LAKR to a total of 165/6 against the San Francisco Unicorns, which they were unable to defend.\n\nThe video of the six went viral on social media, posted by the official account of Major League Cricket.\n\nWatch: Andre Russell's gigantic 107m six\n\nIn the third ball of the final over, the mighty Jamaican power-hitter heaved a pitched-up ball by Haris Rauf into the stands over the mid-wicket region, making it the longest six of MLC season two. Russell contributed an unbeaten 25-ball 40 to help LAKR to a fighting score.\n\nHowever, LAKR's total would not be enough, as the San Francisco Unicorns made mincemeat of the target and chased it down in just 15.2 overs.\n\nLAKR now stand on one win and two defeats after three games, having finished the previous season at the bottom of the table.\n\nAndre Russell has been in good form in 2024. Russell contributed heavily with both bat and ball as Kolkata Knight Riders won IPL 2024. He scored 222 runs and picked up 19 wickets, finishing as the joint fourth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament.\n\nHis turnout wasn't as great in the 2024 T20 World Cup on home soil, as West Indies crashed out in the Super 8 stage after winning all of their group games.\n\nHowever, Russell has put his T20 World Cup disappointment behind him, and reunited with Kolkata Knight Riders teammate Sunil Narine, who's captaining LAKR in MLC. LAKR's next match is against the San Francisco Unicorns again, on Sunday, July 14."

        "date": "Wed Jul 10 10:03:16 2024",
        "body": "Now the Major League Cricket in the United States is in full swing. The Seattle Orcas, have registered their first win of the competition. Following the disappointment of the first game, when the team from Washington state went down tamely to MI New York, the Orcas, led by South Africa international Heinrich Klaasen came back strong to down the La Knight Riders by nine Wickets.\n\nIt was a measured performance by the Seattle Orcas. Having restricted the powerful La Knight Riders batting lineup to 168 for 5 in their 20 overs, the Orcas didn’t seem it necessary to rush their response. Having lost opener Nauman Anwar early, the team settled down to pace the innings, and to get to the target with as few risks as possible. Which is what they did.\n\nSeattle Orcas Restrict the La Knight Riders\n\nDespite losing their last game against the San Francisco Unicorns, the La Knight Riders are a force to be reckoned with. With top-class batters like David Miller, and Andre Russell in the lineup. And the Knight Riders got off to a decent start, posting 67 in 9.3 overs at the fall of the 2nd wicket. However, that is when the Seattle Orcas’ bowling attack put the screws on the La middle order.\n\nWith Cameron Gannon, Zaman Khan, and Imad Wasim locking down the opposition batsman and knocking a few off as well. Jason Roy was the top scorer for the La Knight Riders with 69 off 52 deliveries. With late impetus provided by David Miller who smashed 44 off 22 inclusive of two sixes. The trouble was this was not enough, especially given the batting of the opposition.\n\nOrcas Chase – The Ryan Rickelton Show\n\n169 was one of those scores in T20 cricket. A score that is not too imposing but not an easy one either. And a lot depends on how the top order of the chasing side pace themselves in going about it. For the Seattle Orcas, that man happened to be Ryan Rickelton. The 27-year-old South African native played a superb 103 off 66 inclusive of five sixes.\n\nThis meant that other players, Quinton de Kock to be exact, just had to hang around and provide support whilst Rickelton blasted the Knight Riders bowling to all corners. However, as the game neared its end, things became a bit tricky, as the Orcas got to the score with just one ball to spare. But a win is a win. However going forward, they would not like to cut it that fine. With the power-hitting that is at their disposal, finishing games off sooner rather than later should be the way forward for the Orcas.\n\nMajor League Cricket Table – No Clear Leaders At the Moment\n\nWhilst it is still early days for the season and the league as a whole-things are already shaping up pretty nicely, as the six major franchises battle it out for the top spot. With five of the six teams registering a win, with no result leaves the Texas Super Kings with no points. For cricket fans in America and elsewhere, if there were questions surrounding the quality of players and competitiveness of the cricket being played, games like this should put those doubts to rest."

He suffered the injury during TSK's first game of the season against Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), where he finished with figures of 1/28. A replacement is yet to be named for the 23-year-old, but veteran all-rounder Dwayne Bravo replaced him in the XI for the upcoming game against Washington Freedom.\n\nCoetzee was part of South Africa's T20 World Cup 2024 squad, but he did not play a game despite playing a couple of games in the T20 International (T20I) series against the West Indies prior to the tournament. The Proteas finished runners-up at the marquee event, losing to India by seven runs in the final in Barbados.\n\nSouth Africa will hope that their fast bowler recovers in time for the tour of the West Indies. He was recently named in the 16-member Test squad. The first Test of the series will begin on August 7 in Trinidad, while the second match will be played in Guyana from August 15.\n\nCoetzee has played three Tests since making his debut last year. He has picked up 10 wickets at 24.50 in the format so far."

His 34 off 23 balls effectively helped his team reach the target despite Hassan Khan's efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns found themselves in a bind on what was a slightly slow pitch. Their powerplay was strong, having scored 74 runs, but they also lost three wickets, losing their momentum because of this.\n\nAfter Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk were sent back to the pavilion courtesy of some brilliant bowling by Zia Ul-Haq, Matt Short continued the ante with a fighting 33. His wicket in the 6th over was a big blow, as the rest of the batting lineup faltered under the disciplined bowling of the Super Kings.\n\nMohammad Mohsin was the standout performer with the ball for the Super Kings, delivering a stellar spell that yielded figures of 4/13. His consistent line and length, coupled with his ability to extract some purchase from the pitch, made life difficult for the Unicorns' batters.\n\nBrief Scores: Texas Super Kings beat San Francisco Unicorns ."

Their decision proved fruitful as they managed to restrict the Unicorns to a modest 127 in 17.5 overs. The standout performer with the ball was Mohammad Mohsin, who claimed four wickets for just 13 runs in 3.5 overs, effectively dismantling the Unicorns' batting lineup.\n\nDwayne Bravo provided crucial support, taking 2 for 20, and ensuring the Unicorns' middle and lower order never settled. Matthew Short was the only bright spot for the Unicorns, scoring a quickfire 33 off 15 balls.\n\nIn response, the Super Kings' chase was clinical. Openers Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway set a blistering pace with a 61-run partnership in just 4.5 overs. Du Plessis, who scored 34 off 17 balls, and Conway, with 32 off 19, laid the foundation for a swift chase.\n\nAaron Hardie further stabilized the innings, contributing 34 off 23 balls, guiding the Super Kings to their target in just 12.5 overs with seven wickets in hand.\n\nThis victory not only lifted the Super Kings from the bottom of the standings but also showcased their potential to dominate the league. With this win, they now lead the points table, while the Unicorns, with two points from two games, find themselves in fifth place in the six-team competition. The win has certainly set the tone for what promises to be an exciting season ahead in the Major League Cricket 2024."

        "body": "Right then, that is it from this exciting encounter between the Los Angeles Knight Riders and Seattle Orcas. However, the action doesn’t stop here and we will be back with more games from Major League Cricket 2024. The next game will be played between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings at Morrisville on 11th July, Thursday. The first ball will be bowled at 12.30 am IST (7.00 pm GMT the previous day) but our coverage will start much earlier. Until then, goodbye and cheers!\n\nRyan Rickelton is the Player of the Match for his scintillating knock of 103 runs in 66 deliveries. He says that he is just happy to be out there and contribute to the team. Adds that he was panicking when he got close to the ton and Quinton de Kock wasn't helping as well. Says that it is always fun to play with him and he is a phenomenal player. Mentions that the wicket was a bit sticky early on but it got better and that is why they chased. Further adds that it was a shocking run with which he completed the hundred, and they decided before that whatever happens, they would run and luckily Narine missed.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, the captain of Seattle Orcas says that they executed the plan perfectly and credits Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton for their partnership. Mentions that they had to work on their mistakes in the previous game. Says that they have a quality group of local players and the experience of overseas players which makes his task a bit easier. Mentions that he was a bit nervous in the last over but he had faith in his batters.\n\nSunil Narine, the skipper of Los Angeles Knight Riders says that they had a decent start but they couldn't take wickets at regular intervals. Feels that they played a good game and mentions that another 15-20 runs on the board would help them. Says that the conditions are better for the team batting second and that has been the norm on this side of the world. Ends by saying they will adapt and bounce back strongly.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw that after a good start by the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the initial phases, they fell behind the eight-ball in the middle overs. A few good overs by the Orcas put them under pressure and that resulted in a few wickets as well. However, the show that David Miller put up in the last few overs helped the Knight Riders end their innings at 168 runs.\n\nWayne Parnell from the Seattle Orcas is up for a chat. He says that they bounced back very well after losing the first game. Adds that they bowled nicely and there were some good pieces of fielding as well, and then the brilliant partnership between Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton. Says that he has been unwell but is recovering well. Mentions that the communication between the two batters was important. Ends by saying that the bucket hat is a part of trying to grow cricket in the US.\n\nSpencer Johnson gave a strong start to the Los Angeles Knight Riders as he sent back Nauman Anwar early on in the innings. After that, things went downhill for them as they failed to get any breakthrough and allowed a big partnership to be formed. They managed to keep things quiet for a while but after 10 overs they had to face the onslaught of the batters. They made some errors in the field as well which might be discussed in the team meetings later on. They took the game till the last over but Ali Khan didn’t have much left to defend. They fought hard but fell short of the win.\n\nSeattle Orcas had a shaky start with the early dismissal of Nauman Anwar. However, a strong partnership between the South African pair of Ryan Rickelton and Quinton de Kock released the pressure. Ryan Rickelton took the aggressive approach initially while de Kock took his time to get used to the conditions and then unleashed his array of shots. They dominated after the halfway mark of the innings and attacked every bowler. The constant rotation of strike too kept the pressure on the opponents and allowed them to bat freely. Ryan Rickelton got to his maiden T20 century while Quinton de Kock scored a half-century to finish things in their favor.\n\nIt was another last-over finish in the Major League Cricket but the Seattle Orcas have taken home those two points. Thanks to the 152-run stand between Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton, they have managed to do it in style and earned themselves their first win of the season.\n\n0\n\nOvers19.3\n\nScore167 - 1\n\nAli Khan to Quinton de Kock, Overpitched and on off, Quinton de Kock drives it a bit too well as the ball zips to mid off, Ryan Rickelton wants the run but is sent back. 2 runs needed in 3 balls now!\n\n6\n\nOvers18.3\n\nScore164 - 1\n\nAndre Russell to Quinton de Kock, SIX! FIFTY FOR QDK! He says it's his turn now! Fuller and on middle, in the slot, Quinton de Kock clears his front leg away and tonks it over the bowler's head for a biggie.\n\n1\n\nOvers18.2\n\nScore158 - 1\n\nAndre Russell to Ryan Rickelton, HUNDRED FOR RICKELTON! What a feat for the young South African! A maiden T20 ton and he has waited for this for a long time after getting out in the 90s on a few occasions. This is full and around off, Ryan Rickelton drives it straight to extra covers and sets off for the run, Sunil Narine picks up and has a shy at the bowler's end but misses with Rickelton putting in a dive.\n\n1\n\nOvers17.6\n\nScore155 - 1\n\nSpencer Johnson to Quinton de Kock, Short of a length and around middle, Quinton de Kock goes for the pull but does not get the power as the ball goes wide of deep square leg for one more. Seattle Orcas need 14 runs to win in the last two overs!\n\n0\n\nOvers16.6\n\nScore147 - 1\n\nSunil Narine to Quinton de Kock, Flatter, short and on leg, Quinton de Kock backs away to cut but gets a bottom edge onto the ground as the ball bounces over the keeper and goes nowhere. Just one run off the over!\n\nStrategic Break! The Seattle Orcas are inches away from a victory courtesy of this partnership between Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton. Both these batters have shown intent and batted sensibly keeping the pressure on the opponents. Los Angeles Knight Riders, on the other hand, will need a few quick wickets to get back in the game. Their morale seems to have dropped as seen by their fielding in the last couple of overs. With less than run a ball required to win, Seattle Orcas should look to keep the aggressive approach and improve their NRR.\n\n4\n\nOvers15.4\n\nScore145 - 1\n\nCorne Dry to Ryan Rickelton, FOUR! Oh..no! Another midfield and it costs LAKR again! This is slower, on a length and around off, Ryan Rickelton punches it with good timing wide of deep point, Shakib Al Hasan runs to his left and dives but the ball just bounces before him and he only manages to parry it to the fence for another boundary.\n\n4\n\nOvers14.1\n\nScore126 - 1\n\nSpencer Johnson to Quinton de Kock, FOUR! This is aggressive batting at its best! Spencer Johnson serves this on a length and around off. Quinton de Kock moves towards it and pulls it over short fine leg. The ball bounces once before crossing the ropes for four runs to begin the over.\n\n1\n\nOvers13.6\n\nScore122 - 1\n\nAli Khan to Quinton de Kock, Ali Khan serves it short and outside off. Quinton de Kock reads the slower one and he slaps it to long off for a single. A good over for the Seattle Orcas."

This match will be played between San Francisco Unicorns and Texas Super Kings at the Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nThe Unicorns started the ongoing tournament with a win and currently have two points.

Klaasen will be the key player in this game. Who will win this game of cricket?\n\nReceive Your Welcome Bonus!\n\nSeattle Orcas form\n\nThe Orcas lost the first game of the season and will be looking for a turnaround. They have multiple players who can change their fortunes and bounce back from that defeat. From the 2023 season, the team continues to benefit from Cameron Gannon's expertise; the pace bowler captured 11 wickets last season, earning him the title of the tournament's top domestic player. Heinrich Klaasen finished the 2023 MLC season as the runner-up in total runs scored, trailing only his South African teammate, Quinton de Kock, having amassed 235 runs for the Seattle Orcas. Quinton de Kock has been instrumental in all parts of the world with his white-ball form.\n\nSeattle Orcas Predicted Lineup\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Nauman Anwar, Aaron Jones, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Wasim, Michael Bracewell, Harmeet Singh, Cameron Gannon, Nandre Burger, Zaman Khan\n\nWashington Freedom form\n\nThe Washington Freedoms have started the season strong with one victory and one match abandoned due to unforeseen circumstances. They have been good but they need to keep the consistency going. They will be looking to make it into the playoffs after doing good in the initial games. Saurabh Netravalkar will play a crucial role in getting early wickets. He has been phenomenal in the recently concluded World Cup and would hope to keep the momentum going.\n\nBefore moving to the United States, Justin Dill was a prominent cricketer in South Africa. Known for his fast bowling and the capacity to swing the ball, Dill has proven himself on the international stage. He secured eight wickets in eight T20 games prior to his relocation.\n\nSteve Smith will again be a key batsman in this format of the game.\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted Lineup\n\nMukhtar Ahmed, Steven Smith, Justin Dill, Obus Pienaar, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Lockie Ferguson, Andries Gous, Saurabh Netravalkar, Marco Jansen, Akeal Hosein\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom Expert Tips & Prediction\n\nThe upcoming match is scheduled for an evening start at Grand Prairie Stadium. The team will be looking to bowl first as we have seen in many night games.\n\nExpect warm and humid conditions, with temperatures likely to rise as the night progresses, and no rain anticipated. A good game of T20 is on the cards. We have seen a lot of low scores on this pitch and we see no difference in this game.\n\nBoth teams in this game have limited history with each other, a common scenario among many Major League Cricket teams. The outcome could hinge on standout performances from key players. Washington Freedom, riding on a wave of recent good form, might have a slight advantage over the Seattle Orcas in this encounter, making them a potentially safer choice."

With a handy total of only 127 needed for a win, openers Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway got off the blocks quickly, setting the tone for the innings. Faf was not as aggressive as he was on the way to his century in the previous game against Washington Freedom but played second fiddle to his New Zealand partner's power-hitting. MLC 2024: Faf du Plessis’ Century in Vain As Texas Super Kings vs Washington Freedom Match Washed Out.\n\nEventually scoring 34 off 17, du Plessis gave away a simple catch, but by then more than half of the total was chased down. Conway took a blow to his fingers and was forced to retire hurt after scoring 32 off 19, but Aaron Hardie took the game on his shoulders thereafter. His 34 off 23 balls effectively helped his team reach the target despite Hassan Khan's efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns found themselves in a bind on what was a slightly slow pitch. Their powerplay was strong, having scored 74 runs, but they also lost three wickets, losing their momentum because of this.\n\nAfter Finn Allen (10) and Jake Fraser-McGurk (11) were sent back to the pavilion courtesy of some brilliant bowling by Zia Ul-Haq, Matt Short continued the ante with a fighting 33. His wicket in the 6th over was a big blow, as the rest of the batting lineup faltered under the disciplined bowling of the Super Kings. MLC 2024: Finn Allen, Matthew Short Star As San Francisco Unicorns Down LA Knight Riders by Six Wickets.\n\nMohammad Mohsin was the standout performer with the ball for the Super Kings, delivering a stellar spell that yielded figures of 4/13. His consistent line and length, coupled with his ability to extract some purchase from the pitch, made life difficult for the Unicorns' batters.\n\nBrief Scores: Texas Super Kings (Devon Conway 32, Aaron Hardie 34, Hassan Khan 2/16) beat San Francisco Unicorns (Matthew Short 33, Mohammad Mohsin 4/13)."

        "body": "India’s new head coach Gautam Gambhir wants Ryan ten Doeschate to be part of the team's backroom staff, Cricbuzz reported on July 11 (Thursday). The former Netherlands all-rounder recently worked with Gambhir at the Kolkata Knight Riders, serving as the team's fielding coach in the championship-winning campaign.\n\nTen Doeschate is also part of the supporting staff of KKR's subsidiaries in the Caribbean Premier League, Major League Cricket and ILT20. Gambhir has already advocated for Abhishek Nayar and the former India all-rounder is almost certain to join the Indian team as an assistant coach, a role similar to the one he wants ten Doeschate for.\n\nIn a video shot at a KKR function during the IPL 2024, Gambhir said: \"When I talk about selflessness, I have never said this in 42 years of my career. And I wanted to say this. The greatest team man I ever played with, the most selfless human being, someone I can take a bullet for, someone who I can trust for life.\n\n\"I can tell you this because in 2011, my first game as a KKR captain, we only had four overseas (players) available. And this man had a fabulous 50-over World Cup. And we went in that game with only three overseas players. He was carrying drinks in that game with no disappointment on his face. He taught me selflessness. Ryan ten Doeschate (sic).\"\n\nIt’s not a secret that the BCCI prefer Indian coaches, so it will be interesting to see how they react to this demand of Gambhir who has requested a free hand in managing the team. The BCCI might not prefer having two assistant coaches for a national team. They could give Nayar the batting coach role and make ten Doeschate the assistant coach.\n\nT Dilip, who served as the fielding coach under outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid, is likely to be retained. As far as the bowling coach is concerned, the names of Lakshmipathy Balaji and Vinay Kumar have been doing the rounds, but it is believed that the BCCI is seeking a higher-profile candidate who would mentor and mould the upcoming crop of fast bowlers.\n\nGambhir and his support staff will take charge of the side from the Sri Lanka tour, consisting of three T20 Internationals (T20I) and as many One-Day Internationals (ODI), starting July 27."

        "body": "India’s newly-appointed head coach Gautam Gambhir is reportedly pushing for the inclusion of former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate into the team's coaching staff.\n\nTen Doeschate recently worked with Gambhir at the Kolkata Knight Riders, where he played the role of a fielding coach during their triumphant IPL 2024 campaign.\n\nMoreover, Ten Doeschate holds multiple positions within KKR’s subsidiaries in the Caribbean Premier League, Major League Cricket, and ILT20.\n\nAccording to a report published in Cricbuzz, Gambhir, who has requested a free hand in managing the team, wants the former Dutch cricketer as one of his key associates.\n\nHowever, the final call will be made by the BCCI, which has favoured hiring only Indian personnel for coaching roles in recent years.\n\nThe report also claims that the board is already discussing Ryan ten Doeschate's name but it wants T Dilip to continue in his role as the fielding coach. In that case, the Dutchman might be considered for a different role.\n\nEarlier, multiple reports suggested that Gautam Gambhir wants to bring along Abhishek Nayar as his assistant coach for the Indian team.\n\nNayar, who has represented India in three ODIs, currently serves as assistant coach at the Kolkata Knight Riders. He also holds the position of director at the KKR academy\n\nIf the BCCI secures the services of both Abhishek Nayar and Ryan ten Doeschate, it will leave a major void in KKR's coaching setup.\n\nGambhir, who replaced Rahul Dravid as India's head coach, will begin his stint with the white-ball tour of Sri Lanka later this month."

        "body": "Known to be arguably the best six-hitter in T20 cricket, West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell made his way again with a magical 107-meter six. Representing the Los Angeles Knight Riders of MLC in the USA’s Major League Cricket, Russell launched Pakistan’s Haris Rauf for a towering six off his final over—the moment went viral on social media courtesy of MLC’s official account.\n\nThis was the case on the third ball of that climactic final over when the phenomenal Jamaican power hitter connected to a pitch-up delivery off Haris Rauf and smashed it well above the mid-wicket stands. This towered strike not only made it the longest six of MLC season two but added plausible runs to LAKR’s total.\n\nAn unbeaten 25-ball 40 by Andre Russell, which included this phenomenal six, saw his team get to a competitive 165/6 against San Francisco Unicorns. Despite his heroics, LAKR’s total went through.\n\nALSO READ: Jatin Paranjpe Shares Insights On Future Challenges For Gautam Gambhir\n\nThe target was hounded down with consummate ease by the San Francisco Unicorns in 15.2 overs, leaving LAKR with one win and two defeats after three games, which was a disappointing outcome for a team that finished at the bottom of the table last season.\n\nRussell has been phenomenal throughout 2024. He was behind Kolkata Knight Riders’ title win in IPL 2024 when he scored 222 runs and took 19 wickets to be the joint fourth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament. But he couldn’t really replicate that in the 2024 T20 World Cup at home – though the West Indies remained unbeaten during the group stage, they eventually got eliminated in the Super 8 phase.\n\nALSO READ: India’s Participation in 2025 ICC Champions Trophy In Doubt: Possible Shift To Sri Lanka or Dubai\n\nShaking off the disappointment of missing out on the World Cup, Russell linked up with his Kolkata Knight Riders colleague Sunil Narine, who captained LAKR in the MLC. With LAKR due to face the San Francisco Unicorns again on Sunday, July 14, form and experience will be everything as Russell looks to redeem his team and finally notch an important win."

They got over the line with only one ball to spare but lost just one wicket and they will now be looking to carry that momentum into this match.\n\nSOR Team Batting\n\nIt was the powerful South African contingent at the top of the order for Seattle Orcas who took their side to victory against Los Angeles Knight Riders in their last game. Opener Ryan Rickelton comes into this match after hitting an unbeaten century with Quinton de Kock looking to replicate his unbeaten half-century.\n\nSOR Team Bowling\n\nBoth Zaman Khan and Harmeet Singh took two wickets each in the win over the Knight Riders but South Africa pace bowler Nandre Burger will be under pressure for his place in the XI after going for 51 runs from his four wicketless overs.
