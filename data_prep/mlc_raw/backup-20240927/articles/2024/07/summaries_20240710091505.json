The Texas Super Kings, on the other hand, were beaten by 12 runs by LAKR in their opening game, scoring only 150-8 in 20 overs.\n\nThe article provides betting analysis for the upcoming match between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings. The Unicorns are favored to post a total above 200 if they bat first, and Liam Plunkett is tipped to be their top bowler. For the Texas Super Kings, Zia-ul-Haq is expected to be their best bowler, and Marcus Stoinis is predicted to score 30+ runs.\n\nThe expert prediction is that the San Francisco Unicorns will outscore the Texas Super Kings in the upcoming match, given the Unicorns' strong top four and the high-scoring nature of the pitch."
