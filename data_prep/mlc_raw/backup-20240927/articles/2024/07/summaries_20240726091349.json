        "text": "The Seattle Orcas had a disappointing season in MLC 2, finishing at the bottom of the table with only 2 points. They lost their final match to the Texas Super Kings by 37 runs, capping off a poor season. The team, which has a heavy South African presence, struggled with tired international players who came straight from the World Cup. The Orcas struggled to score consistently, particularly when batting first, and failed to win a match when opening with the batting since July 15, 2023. In their final match, Ayan Desai made a promising debut, taking 2 wickets and scoring 30 runs, but the team's batting performance was poor, with no player scoring more than 26 runs. Despite the disappointing season, the article views MLC season 2 as a positive step forward for cricket in the United States."
