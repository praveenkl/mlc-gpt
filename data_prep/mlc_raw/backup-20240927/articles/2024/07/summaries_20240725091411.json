        "text": "The eliminator match of the MLC 2024 will be played between Texas Super Kings (TSK) and MI New York (MINY) on July 25, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. The winner of this match will advance to the next round, while the loser will be eliminated from the tournament. Texas Super Kings are considered to have a slight advantage due to their balanced squad featuring explosive batters like Devon Conway, Faf du Plessis, and Marcus Stoinis, as well as a strong bowling attack led by Dwayne Bravo and Noor Ahmad. MI New York will rely on the big-hitting prowess of Nicholas Pooran and Kieron Pollard to propel them to victory. The predicted score if TSK bat first is 174+, and if MINY bat first is 145+. The winning chances are predicted to be 62% for TSK and 38% for MINY, with TSK predicted to win the match."
