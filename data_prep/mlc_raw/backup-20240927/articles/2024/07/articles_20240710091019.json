        "body": "As the only small market in the six-team Major League Cricket, Seattle Orcas has an audacious plan to build its brand.\n\nIn a nod to the Dallas Cowboys, the world's most profitable sports team according to Forbes, the Orcas aim to become 'America's Team' in MLC - the lucrative pro T20 league that has just started a pivotal second season.\n\n\"We really are thinking about it for the long-term,\" Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar told me in a phone interview. \"We are not here thinking about MLC for the next five years and just saying 'let's get some value and move on'.\n\n\"There is no reason why we need to restrict this to just Seattle or the Pacific Northwest.\"\n\nForbesAmerica's Major League Cricket Set To Ride Momentum Of T20 World Cup\n\nMuch like the Seattle Sounders in Major League Soccer, whom Somasegar is part of the ownership group, the Orcas have encouraged passionate fans to get together and form the 'Pod Squad'.\n\n\"The squad is our way of saying we're going to get a group of people together who are excited about Seattle Orcas,\" said Somasegar, who has lived in Seattle for over three decades. \"And we think the 'Pod Squad' should exist not just in Seattle, but around the country.\n\n\"One guy from the Bay Area recently reached out to us and said that he had been watching MLC since it started. He said 'the way you guys have been inclusive, I'm a fan of your team more than any other. I like what you're doing and I want to be part of you'.\n\n\"So that's what we want to do and that's what we mean by becoming 'America's Team'.\"\n\nWhile inventiveness has made the Orcas stand out so far in the fledgling competition, cementing roots in the northwest seaport city will be vital for long-term success of the franchise.\n\nThe Orcas are an outlier compared to the other franchises based in the major locales of Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Washington DC and Dallas (Texas).\n\nSeattle beat out Atlanta and Chicago to complete the inaugural list of teams. As I reported recently, Atlanta and Chicago are set to be part of an expanded MLC in the coming seasons, while a move into Canada is also potentially on the cards.\n\nForbesChicago And Atlanta Could Be The Next Franchises In Major League Cricket\n\nParochialism is an advantage for the Orcas nestled in a relatively smaller market as underlined by the franchise being given more press coverage than its rivals. Exposure might be a bit easier for Orcas, but the hierarchy is keen to grow cricket from the ground up.\n\n\"We need to put a lot of effort into the community to not only get the right level of interest and excitement for the sport, but to also show kids that cricket can be a choice for them,\" said Somasegar, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group having spent 27 years working at Microsoft.\n\n\"We have this notion called 'cricket in a box', where we go to schools and show the basics of cricket. We're seeing early signs of traction. Our goal is to have cricket programs in schools.\n\n\"We need to cultivate cricket throughout the year because that's what is required for this sport to have a chance to be mainstream over a period of time.\"\n\nLike its debut season, where MLC exceeded financial expectations, the tournament is only being played in Dallas, the heartbeat of American cricket, and the more modest ground in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThere are plans amid an expanded MLC - played in a home and away format - for each franchise to have its own cricket stadium.\n\nA home ground for the Orcas has been planned at King County’s Marymoor Park, around 15 miles from Seattle, and likely to hold about 6000-8000 fans.\n\nIt is hoped to be ready by the 2026 season and possibly become a venue for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, where cricket will make its first Olympic appearance since 1900.\n\n\"My hope is Seattle has a stadium up and running by then because we have as much potential to host Olympic (cricket) games as anyone else,\" Somasegar said. \"That will be another great opportunity to showcase the sport in this country.\"\n\nThe Orcas are out to go one better after losing last year's final to MI New York, but lost the rematch in the opening game of this season.\n\nLike every other team, the Orcas have a mixture of international stars and local talent. Big names include big-hitting South Africans Heinrich Klaasen and Quinton de Kock, along with American sensation Aaron Jones who lit up the T20 World Cup.\n\nFor India-born Somasegar, building the blocks of a cricket franchise in his adopted home has become a dream come true.\n\n\"I grew up with cricket and derived so much pleasure from it in my life,\" he said. \"The vast majority of people in the U.S. have not experienced cricket, so this is building the sport from the ground up which is exciting.\n\n\"In Seattle, we have the loudest and most passionate sports fans in the country. There are a lot of great things happening here with technology and having big global companies in our backyard.\n\n\"It's a great place for cricket to be and it's satisfying playing a small role in this journey.\""

        "date": "Tue Jul  9 23:25:00 2024",
        "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns began their 2024 Major League Cricket season with an impressive six-wicket defeat of the Los Angeles Knight Riders in their opening match, whilst the Texas Super Kings suffered a defeat to LAKR before perhaps being saved by the rain for a no result against the Washington Freedom.\n\nDATE & TIME: Wednesday 10th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:00pm / USA PT – 12:00pm / West Indies – 2:00pm / UK – 8:00pm / South Africa – 9:00pm / Thursday 11th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:00am / India – 12:30am / Bangladesh – 1:00am / Australia – 5:00am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 34c or 93.2 F with clear, sunny skies\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: SPEEDY SAN FRANCISCO\n\nIn the inaugural season of Major League Cricket last year, the San Francisco Unicorns finished fifth with two victories and three defeats in their five matches. This time, though, the Unicorns demolished LAKR. They held them to just 165-6 in their 20 overs before chasing that down with six wickets to spare in just 15.2 overs with excellent innings’ from Finn Allen and Matt Short.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLWL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: DAD’S ARMY\n\nWith the influence of the so-called ‘Dad’s Army’ of the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League, the Texas Super Kings were beaten by 12 runs by LAKR in their opening game with TSK making just 150-8 in their 20 overs before then scoring 203-5 against the Washington Freedom. The rain helped them out, though, with the Freedom already on 62-0 in just four overs.\n\nLAST THREE: ALLLW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns were extremely impressive with both bat and ball in their defeat of LAKR. Their top four of Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Short and Josh Inglis will likely outscore anyone and a bet on the Unicorns to post a total in advance of 200, if they bat first, would be good value as they can go hard until quite late in the order with Liam Plunkett in at nine.\n\nFormer England international Plunkett performed his excellent ‘middle overs’ role well again in their opener as he took the wicket of former teammate Jason Roy with just the third ball outside of the powerplay. With TSK’s lineup structured to take the game deep, Plunkett will be pivotal and it would therefore be worthwhile to back Plunkett to be the Unicorns’ top bowler.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIn their opening encounter, the Texas Super Kings took seven wickets against LAKR but their most threatening bowler, Marcus Stoinis, picked up two wickets but went for 37 runs in his three overs. The most control was shown by Pakistani seamer Zia-ul-Haq and him to be their best bowler, once again, in what is a fairly weak attack, would appear a good bet for this one.\n\nWith the bat, TSK will have to think about upping the run rate with Faf du Plessis’ impressive century the other day still looking like it wouldn’t have been enough to defeat Washington. Stoinis found some touch with 29 off 18 and the Aussie all-rounder to continue to grow into the tournament with a 30+ score here would be worth having a go on.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS VS TEXAS SUPER KINGS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThe volatility in Twenty20 cricket means that tactical trends can be quite sweeping and come in quite quickly before fading just as fast. What is a point to mention here is that the top four of the San Francisco Unicorns features four of the modern-day white-ball players where they go hard from the off, whilst Devon Conway and Du Plessis open up for a TSK side looking to pragmatically get games won. There is perhaps no right or wrong way if you are eventually successful but it has to be said that the Unicorns, on a pitch now producing some very high scores, should simply be favoured to outscore their opposition."

Los Angeles Knight Riders have experienced mixed feelings at the start of the tournament with a win and a loss against Texas Super Kings and San Francisco Unicorns respectively. On the other hand, Seattle Orcas lost badly to MI New York in the tournament opener by 6 wickets.\n\nMatch Details:\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders vs Seattle Orcas, Match 6\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas\n\nDate & Time: July 10th at 6:00 AM IST and July 9th at 7:30 PM Local Time\n\nLive Streaming: Sony Sports Network and JioCinema\n\nWhat is the Pitch Report for LAKR vs SEA, Major League Cricket 2024, Match 6?\n\nThe surface produced middling scores in the last couple of matches.

In 2 matches in the tournament, he scored 50 runs at a strike rate of 166.66 and is yet to pick a wicket.\n\nTop Pick – Bowler\n\nSpencer Johnson got more purchase from the surface and bowled quick against Texas Super Kings and San Francisco Unicorns, picking up 5 wickets with the best figures of 3 for 36.\n\nTop Pick – Wicketkeeper\n\nHeinrich Klaasen is an excellent player of spin but only managed to find the deep mid-wicket fielder for just 5 runs against MI New York.

Unmukt Chand, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Shubham Ranjane, Aaron Jones, Shakib Al Hasan (vc), Harmeet Singh, Sunil Narine (c), Andre Russell, Cameron Gannon, Spencer Johnson\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders who made a stunning comeback to hand Texas Super Kings a 12-run loss in their first game, failed to produce the same magic in the follow-up against San Francisco Unicorns and lost the match by 6 wickets with 28 balls to spare. Batting first they recovered well from 96 for 5 to post a target of 166, thanks to exceptional death batting from Andre Russell who added unbeaten 40* from 25 balls. In the defense, barring Spencer Johnson who claimed 3 wickets, the rest of the bowlers looked dull and the game slipped away from their hands quite easily. Will they get their mojo back against the Seattle Orcas? we need to wait and watch."

        "body": "Former India U-19 World Cup winning captain Unmukt Chand has opened up on his absence from USA's squad for the recently-concluded T20 World Cup. Chand took retirement from Indian cricket in 2021 before shifting base to the USA for better cricketing opportunities. After playing in the inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC), as well as other franchise tournaments, Chand became eligible to play for the USA. He had also expressed his wish of playing against India in the T20 World Cup, only to be left out of the squad.\n\nChand revealed that he was shocked after being left out of T20 World Cup squad, added that he had a feeling of being \"sucked inside\".\n\n\"That wasn't an ideal situation to be in. Because personally for me, this was what I had dreamed for the last three years. Obviously, it was a big shock. And it took me time to sort of come to terms with it.

I won't say which just happened. But it was difficult.

It keeps sucking you inside and inside. That feeling would linger on for a day and then go away and then come back again. The reality would hit me in different phases. Once you keep going through that automatically you keep getting better. There comes a time when you're like it didn't happen, that's it. I'm not even thinking about it,\" he added.\n\nChand, 31, has a point to prove, and started off the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) - USA's franchise T20 league - with a swashbuckling half-century.\n\nInterestingly, Chand's present MLC franchise is Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), who are owned by the Knight Riders group. Many might remember that Chand's downfall started when he was famously clean bowled by Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Brett Lee in the opening ball of IPL 2013. He made 68 off 45 balls, hitting six 4s and three 6s."

        "body": "The West Indies begin a three-match Test series against England on Wednesday which, regardless of the outcome, will give them an advantage before the two Tests against the Proteas next month.\n\nWhile the West Indies will be well up to speed with the Test format, by contrast, a large chunk of the 16 South African players named in the Test squad on Monday are either playing in the Major League Cricket T20 tournament in the US or not at all. Only David Bedingham, Wiaan Mulder and Matthew Breetzke are contracted on the county circuit.\n\nAt least that trio will have some first class matches under the belt and in Bedingham’s case, excellent form. Proteas coach Shukri Conrad said in a chat he had with Bedingham last week he told him to “save some runs for us”, after the 30-year-old surged to the top of the County Championship Division One run scorer’s list with an aggregate of 926 runs in 14 innings for Durham.\n\nHe has made five centuries and two half-centuries in that sequence, proving the decision to call him up for the Test squad last summer was overdue.\n\nBedingham’s form will be crucial, given he has rhythm in the longer format, something the MLC contracted players and those in South Africa will need to achieve through training camps and the sole warm-up match the squad will have in Trinidad before the first Test, which starts on August 7.\n\n“We have the luxury of a warm-up game and we have 10 days in Trinidad before the first Test,” said Conrad.\n\nPreparation for previous series against the West Indies and India last year were less than a week, so Conrad’s excitement about having 10 days is understandable.\n\n“You have to roll with the punches, this is the modern world. I’m comfortable that guys in America can take the flight across and we have a week’s preparation before the first Test. It is what it is and we will make it work.”\n\nThe build-up to the first Test between the West Indies and England that starts at Lord’s on Wednesday has been dominated by Jimmy Anderson, who is playing his 188th and final Test. That has helped overshadow the threat the West Indies pose, particularly with the ball.\n\nThough robbed of Kemar Roach, who was ruled out of the series with a knee injury, the West Indies still field a potent pace bowling trio in Jayden Seales, Alzarri Joseph and young sensation Shamar Joseph. The latter inspired the West Indies to their memorable victory over Australia in Brisbane earlier this year taking 7/68 in the second innings of that match.\n\n“They have a nice [set] of fast bowlers and having won in Australia they will have added confidence,” said Conrad.\n\nHe had a first-hand look at Seales and Joseph last season when the pair toured South Africa with a West Indies A team, so there will be no surprises there. Much like England will have noted in their preparation, the West Indies’ batting isn’t as strong.\n\n“There might be some frailties in the batting department that we can expose and exploit,” said Conrad.\n\nThe main frailty is inexperience. Among the batters, three haven’t played a Test, while three others — Kavem Hodge, Alick Athanaze and Kirk McKenzie — have a combined nine Tests between them.\n\nThey will be heavily reliant on captain Kraigg Brathwaite, former skipper Jason Holder, who wasn’t in Australia because he was contracted to the International League T20 in the UAE at the time, and wicketkeeper Joshua da Silva for their runs."

In the second innings, Washington Freedom faced an early setback with the dismissal of Travis Head (1). Steve Smith initially took a couple of overs to settle in, but once he found his rhythm and struck his first boundary on his seventh ball, the New York bowlers struggled to contain him. The Australian star batter smashed four fours and three sixes, racing to an impressive 46* off 28 balls.\n\nWith 7.4 overs of the Washington Freedom innings done, the match took a turn for the worse as rain and lighting brought on the covers. However, Smith’s power-hitting in the final over of the powerplay took them ahead on DLS with a score of 55/1. In the end, that proved enough to seal the match as rain played spoilsport."

        "body": "Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) won their first match in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024, edging out Texas Super Kings (TSK) by 12 runs at the Grand Prairie Stadium. The match witnessed a dramatic turn of events, with Andre Russell’s bizarre dismissal adding a touch of misfortune to the Knight Riders’ hard-fought victory.\n\nLA Knight Riders sets competitive target\n\nBatting first, the Knight Riders posted a commendable total of 162/7 in their 20 overs. Unmukt Chand anchored the innings with a well-composed 68 runs, while Nitish Kumar chipped in with a valuable 26. The Super Kings’ bowling attack, spearheaded by Zia-ul-Haq‘s economical spell of 2/16, did well to restrict the flow of runs.\n\nAndre Russell’s bizarre dismissal\n\nThe turning point of the Knight Riders’ innings arrived in the 14th over. The big-hitting Dre Russ, known for his explosive batting, had a forgettable outing. Facing a yorker from Gerald Coetzee angling away from his body, Russell attempted a flick but ended up dislodging his own stumps with the bat while trying to play the shot. This comical yet crucial dismissal restricted him to a mere 10 runs off 5 deliveries.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Derone Davis takes a screamer to dismiss Joshua Tromp in TSK vs LAKR game at MLC 2024\n\nAli Khan shines for LAKR\n\nDespite Russell’s unfortunate exit, the Knight Riders bowlers rose to the occasion in the second innings. Right-arm pacer Ali Khan emerged as the hero, weaving a web of deception with his accurate fast bowling. His impressive spell of 4/33 put immense pressure on the Super Kings batters.\n\nChasing a target of 163, TSK started brightly with opener Devon Conway scoring a vital half-century (53 runs). However, the lack of substantial partnerships from other batters hampered their progress. The Knight Riders’ bowling attack, with Ali Khan leading the charge, maintained tight lines and lengths, stifling the Super Kings’ scoring rate. In the end, they fell short of the target by 12 runs, managing only 150/8 in their allotted 20 overs."

        "body": "Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings shared the honours after their match in Major League Cricket 2024 at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina on Monday had to be called off due to heavy rain.\n\nSteve Smith and Travis Head had powered us to 62/0 in four overs after a rollicking start to the chase. Head hit two sixes and four fours in his unbeaten 32 off just 12 balls whereas Smith remained unconquered at 26 in only 13 balls striking three sixes and a boundary.\n\nBut rain had the final say as the game did not proceed further after four overs in the second innings.\n\nEarlier, Faf du Plessis top-scored in the match with 100 off just 58 balls to guide TSK to 203/5 in 20 overs. Saurabh Netravalkar was the pick among our bowlers with a tidy spell of 2/33 in four overs.\n\nPut into bat first, TSK got off to a good start reaching 67/0 at the end of the powerplay. Netravalkar broke the 109-run opening wicket partnership when he dismissed Devon Conway for 39, who was caught in the deep.\n\nAkeal Hosein struck in the next over to bring us back in the contest as we got two wickets in the space of five runs and TSK were 114/2 after 12 overs. But Faf du Plessis and Marcus Stoinis added a quickfire 62 off just 29 balls to take TSK past the 150-run mark.\n\nNetravalkar bowled an excellent penultimate over conceding just four runs including the wicket of centurion du Plessis as TSK finished at 203/5. Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen and Justin Dill chipped in with a wicket each.\n\nIn response, our skipper Steve Smith started from where he left off in the last match hitting three sixes and a four to give us a flying start. Travis Head too joined the party plundering 22 runs in the fourth over as we raced to 62/0 in just four overs.\n\nBut rain played spoilsport as the match had to be called off and both teams got a point each since the mandatory five overs were not completed for the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method to be used.\n\nWith that, we moved to the top of the MLC 2024 points table with three points from two matches.\n\nWe are up against the Seattle Orcas in the next match on Thursday at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas."

        "body": "This side of the Earth was just host to one of the most exciting World Cups in recent memory and now the eyes of the cricketing world will remain fixed on the US as Major League Cricket gets ready to fire up its second season.\n\nLast year, it was Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran, Rashid Khan, and MI New York that got to hoist the championship trophy in Texas. There's been a lot of player movement since last year and a lot of world-class cricketers will be playing in the league for the first time, but will anyone have the chops to dethrone MINY?\n\nMI New York\n\nThe New Yorkers didn't do a lot of tinkering with the roster that took home the title. With a batting lineup that includes Pollard, Pooran, Dewald Brevis, and Tim David and a bowling attack that features Rashid, Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and the US's best spin bowler in Nosh Kenjige, there simply wasn't a whole lot to do. The biggest absentee from last year's squad is David Wiese. While Wiese spent the last month helping anchor Namibia's World Cup team, his time spent with MINY in 2023 wasn't as memorable. If anything, New York's bowling -- which was already one of the scariest in the league -- will get a boost from South African speedster Anrich Nortje, who spent last year with Washington.\n\nWith a roster very similar to the one that won it all last year, MINY will be the team to beat this year.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nThe Orcas were the most consistent team in the league last year, taking a 5-1 record into the championship match. And, like MINY, they didn't do a lot of off-season roster movement. The team's core -- South Africans Heinrich Klaasan and Quinton de Kock, as well as Shayan Jayasuriya and Nauman Anwar (familiar names to fans of Minor League Cricket) -- remains intact.\n\nGone this year are Shimron Hetmyer and Andrew Tye. Seattle hopes to replace Hetmyer's bat -- though probably not his colorful hair -- with USA's Aaron Jones. Jones' 94 not out against Canada in the first match of the World Cup might be considered the spark that led the team to a berth in the Super Eights round. Making up Tye's lost overs will be South African Nandre Burger and West Indian Obed McCoy.\n\nLook for the Orcas to make another strong run at the MLC title again this year.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nThe Texas Super Kings wound up with the second-best record after the regular season, but back-to-back losses in the playoffs exposed the weaknesses that had haunted them throughout the campaign. Captain Faf du Plessis was abysmal as an opener and it seemed like they spent the early parts of every innings trying to claw back from a slow start.\n\nSo, what do you do? Well, if you're TSK, you clean house. Gone are the three of the team's top four run producers from last year -- Daniel Sams, David Miller, and Dwayne Bravo. And on the other side of the ball, gone are Gerald Coetzee and USA Cricket's Rusty Theron. That's a lot of runs and a lot of overs to make up.\n\nHoping to bring new life to the team and give TSK fans something to blow their whistles about are some big names: South African World Cup captain Aiden Markram, Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis, who played with San Francisco last year, and Afghanistan bowler Naveen ul-Haq. Another player to keep an eye on is 19-year-old Joshua Tromp, who lit up Minor League Cricket last year with the Houston Hurricanes.\n\nIf the new names come through, look for TSK to return to the playoffs. If they struggle, though, that's a lot of added pressure on captain Faf, Devon Conway, and domestic stars Milind Kumar and Calvin Savage.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nThe Freedom finished third in the league last year with a 3-2 record but were bounced in the first eliminator by the eventual champs, MINY. To make it back to the playoffs, Washington will have to deal with the departures of some big guns. Like TSK, they've seen the departure of three of their top four runs scorers from last year -- captain Moises Henriques, Matthew Short, and Glenn Phillips.\n\nThe team is in good shape, though, thanks to the addition of new captain, Australia's Steve Smith, New Zealand phenom Rachin Ravindra, and England's super solid Travis Head.\n\nThe Freedom's vicious bowling attack -- Marco Jansen, USA hero Saurabh Netravalkar, and West Indies spinner Akeal Hosein -- gets a boost from the addition of Lockie Ferguson. CricAmerica fave Dane Piedt won't be back with the team this year but look for some spin help from Amila Aponso and Akhilish Bodugum, who have both been impressive in minor league action.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nThe Unicorns started the 2023 campaign strongly. They left the Dallas portion of the schedule with a 2-1 record but were never able to get on track in Morrisville. They lost back-to-back matches at Church Street Park to see their playoff hopes dashed.\n\nThere are lots of new faces on the team in 2024. Captain Aaron Finch has been replaced by Australian all-around-good-guy Pat Cummins. While retaining their top run scorer in USA's Corey Anderson, the Unicorns will have a lot of runs -- and overs -- to make up with the departures of Matthew Wade and all-rounders Marcus Stoinis and Shadab Khan.\n\nHoping to fill that void are 22-year-old Aussie Jake Fraser-McGurk, who had a breakout Indian Premier League season for the Dehli Capitals, Matthew Short, who led the Washington Freedom in scoring last year, and Sherfane Rutherford, who just about single-handedly took down New Zealand in a vital West Indies World Cup win.\n\nThis could be an interesting year for San Francisco. Pat Cummins knows how to win; he captained Australia to titles in both the most recent World Test Championship as well as the 2023 Cricket World Cup. If he can get the Unicorns going in right direction, they could be a playoff contender.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nNo team had more flash and less success last year than the Knight Riders. With a batting lineup that included Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Rilee Rossouw, and Unmukt Chand and a bowling attack with two of the most creative spinners on the planet -- Sunil Narine and Adam Zampa -- as well as Lockie Ferguson and Ali Khan, they were beasts…on paper.\n\nIn reality, though, nothing clicked. They limped to a 1-4 record. And it wasn't even a pretty 1-4. They lost to TSK by 69 and got bowled out for 50 in a 105-run loss to MINY.\n\nThis year, they'll have to try it all again without Rossouw, who -- along with Russell -- was the only Knight Rider to crack 100 runs. Hoping to boost the offense is David Miller, who scored 143 for TSK last year and Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Also gone for 2024 is New Zealand quick Ferguson but LA hopes to make up the difference with Josh Little, who's had success in The Hundred and was the first Irish player to sign with the IPL.\n\nLAKR should be better than last year. Narine had a monster year for champions KKR in the IPL -- and West Indies fans can only wonder what would have happened if he was on the 2024 T20 World Cup team! If everyone else plays somewhat up to potential, the men in purple could make a run for the playoffs.\n\nThis season the Major League Cricket schedule is bumped up to seven matches for each team and games will -- once again -- be split between Grand Prairie Stadium outside of Dallas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. Matches will be broadcast over the Willow cable channel and app with various regional sports networks bringing the action to those who don't have Willow."
