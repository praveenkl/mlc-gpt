        "text": "**Timing and Momentum**: The MLC's second season is set to start on July 5, just six days after the T20 men's cricket World Cup final, which could help capitalize on the momentum of the US team's recent success.\n\n**Background**: Cricket is the second-most-watched sport in the world, but previous attempts to establish a professional league in the US have failed. MLC debuted in July 2023 with six teams competing in the T20 format, featuring top players from around the world.\n\n**Season 1**: The first season of MLC outperformed expectations, with sold-out games in Morrisville, NC, and high attendance in Grand Prairie, TX. The league received positive feedback from players and fans alike.\n\n**Challenges and Goals**: The league's biggest challenge is building infrastructure, including permanent venues in each city. The goal is to create a more casual presence in American sports fans' lives and eventually secure more lucrative broadcast deals.\n\n**Expansion and Growth**: MLC is planning to expand to new cities, including Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto, New Jersey, and South Florida, with the aim of adding two new teams by 2026. The league is also developing a minor league to cultivate young domestic talent and plans to increase community outreach and engagement.\n\n**Broadcast and Partnerships**: MLC games will be broadcast in more than 80 countries, and the league is negotiating partnerships with regional sports networks in its six cities. Select games will air on CBS Sports Network.\n\n**US National Teams**: The success of the US men's national team, including their upset win over Pakistan, has helped drive more attention to the sport. MLC's director believes this will open up better broadcast opportunities for the league."
