Shehan Jayasuriya (24 in 27 balls, with three fours and a six) joined Quinton de Kock (26 in 19 balls, with two fours and a six), and the pair took control of the run chase. At the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 47/1.\n\nAlso Read | Will Lamine Yamal Play Tonight in Uzbekistan vs Spain Paris Olympics 2024 Match? Here's the Possibility of Barcelona Star Featuring in Starting XI.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya eventually fell to Calvin Savage in the seventh over after a 27-ball stint at the crease. Not long after, the dangerous Quinton de Kock was also dismissed, leaving the Orcas at 59/3 in the ninth over.\n\nFaced with a steep equation, the onus was on Heinrich Klaasen (4) and Matthew Bracewell (4) to steer the innings. However, both batters were outfoxed by spinners and dismissed for single digits. Mitchell Santner saw the back of Klaasen, while Bracewell was trapped by Noor Ahmad.\n\nComing together with the score at 67/5 in 10.4 overs, Shubham Ranjane (16) and Keemo Paul (25 in 17 balls, with three fours) labored to keep the Orcas in contention. However, Ranjane was run out and Keemo Paul was castled by Noor Ahmad before the 17th over, comprehensively extinguishing the run chase. Ali Sheikh chipped in with a consolatory knock, but the Orcas fell well short, finishing at 140/9.Otneill Bartman took two wickets in the tail to finish with figures of 3/20.\n\nEarlier in the day. The Texas Super Kings lost openers Devon Conway (0) and Joshua Tromp (6) early in the innings, however, Faf Du Plessis (39 in 17 balls) was in fine form, smashing six boundaries and a six before he was scalped by Keemo Paul. At the end of the power play the Texas Super Kings were placed at 56/3.\n\nMilind Kumar (29 in 28 balls, with two sixes) played a watchful knock, scoring nearly a run-a-ball before he became Keemo Paul's second wicket of the day. The experienced all-rounders, Marcus Stoinis (11) and Mitchell Santner (15) both got starts, but failed to convert them into bigger scores, falling to Aryan Desai and Matthew Bracewell, respectively.\n\nCalvin Savage (45* in 27 balls, with six fours and two sixes) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson, the pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings. Stevenson (17) struck a four and six to support Savage's late innings fireworks, but was cleaned by Nandre Burger in the 18th overs.\n\nSavage hammered Bracewell for two consecutive maximums in the 16th over and went on to script a 17 run over of Nande Burger's 18th over to remain unbeaten and help the Texas Super Kings finish at 177/8.\n\nBrief Scores\n\nTexas Super Kings 177/8 (Faf Du Plessis 39 off 17, Colin Savage 45* off 27, Keemo Paul 2/18, Ayan Desai 2/30) beat Seattle Orcas 140/9 (Quinton de Kock 26 off 19, Keemo Paul 25 off 17, Ottneil Bartman 3/20, Noor Ahmad 2/19 ) by 37 runs.

        "body": "Right then, that's it from this final group stage game, where the Texas Super Kings secured two more points and will head into the playoffs of this second season of Major League Cricket. The excitement continues with the first knockout game, the Eliminator, scheduled for Thursday, July 25th. In this high-stakes match, the Texas Super Kings will face off against MI New York for a coveted spot in the Qualifier. The first ball is set to be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT), but be sure to tune in earlier for all the pre-match buildup. Until then, cheers and goodbye!\n\nFaf du Plessis, the skipper of the Texas Super Kings says it was important for a few guys to get time in the middle and they decided to change the batting order a bit to make sure they head into the crucial stage with good momentum. Further adds that they focused on getting the small things right heading into the big Eliminator in a day's time.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, the skipper of Seattle Orcas says it has been a tough and difficult season for them. Adds that with a few guys being injured, it is quite difficult to find the concrete 11. Informs that the bowling group has been fantastic, but the batting group were the ones who could not make it count. Adds that it is very tough to find the rhythm of the game in just seven matches. States that they can make some investments in a couple of players. Concludes that it is not doom and gloom for the franchise and hopes to reset and re-focus for the next season.\n\nCalvin Savage is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his outstanding all-round performance. He says it was good fun after having put in so much hard work it felt very good. Adds that he tried to keep things simple in the middle and stay positive and it paid well for him with the bat. Further says he tries to vary the pace and keep it tight using long boundaries to his advantage. Concludes that he will try to keep things the same going ahead.\n\nEarlier in the game, Ayan Desai gave the Seattle Orcas a perfect start by dismissing Devon Conway on the very first ball of the innings. Cameron Gannon then joined the fray, taking another wicket in his first over. Despite these early setbacks, Faf du Plessis kept his intentions clear and continued to score from one end for TSK, but he lost his wicket just before the end of the powerplay. The Texas Super Kings kept losing wickets in the middle around Milind Kumar who looked steady in his outing but couldn't carry on after getting himself off to a good start. TSK however managed to get back on track in the final few overs, thanks to a blistering onslaught from Calvin Savage, who remained unbeaten with 45 off just 27 balls. He received valuable support from Cameron Stevenson, helping TSK reach a competitive total of 177 runs. For the Seattle Orcas, Keemo Paul and Ayan Desai had standout performances, each claiming two wickets.\n\nOttneil Baartman stood out with impressive figures of 3 for 20 for the Texas Super Kings. Alongside him, the other bowlers chipped in to ensure the job was done. Noor Ahmad was a mystery for the Orcas batters, ending with a couple of wickets, while Calvin Savage also claimed two wickets. Despite a few missed chances in the field, the Texas Super Kings will be mighty pleased with their efforts, particularly their comeback with the bat. They will now carry this momentum into the all-important eliminator.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, on whom the game was resting, once again failed to make his presence felt, extending his dry run with another low score and putting the Orcas in an even deeper hole. The Texas Super Kings' spinners compounded the Orcas' struggles, making run-scoring increasingly difficult. Shubham Ranjane and Keemo Paul fought back with a 39-run partnership, attempting to take on a few bowlers in the middle overs. However, with the asking rate soaring, it became an insurmountable task, resulting in another defeat for the Orcas. This marked their sixth loss in seven games, ending the tournament on a forgettable note.\n\nOttneil Baartman gave the Super Kings a perfect start by claiming the wicket of Ryan Rickelton on the very first ball of the innings. Despite a gritty partnership between Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya, the bowlers kept things tight, building pressure on the batters. This pressure led to the fall of a couple more wickets before the halfway mark, further complicating the chase for the Seattle Orcas.\n\nW\n\nOvers18.5\n\nScore132 - 9\n\nOttneil Baartman to Ali Sheikh, OUT! CAUGHT! Another one bites the dust. Ottneil Baartman entices the batter with the short one and he falls for it. Ali Sheikh swivels on his back foot and pulls it to deep square leg. The ball is hit flat and hard, but straight down the throat of Marcus Stoinis who makes no mistake this time either.\n\nW\n\nOvers18.3\n\nScore131 - 8\n\nOttneil Baartman to Cameron Gannon, OUT! CAUGHT! Marcus Stoinis takes a stunning catch near the ropes. It is too full, wide outside off. Cameron Gannon throws his blade at it and ends up slicing it to the left of deep backward point. Marcus Stoinis moves to his left and pouches it safely.\n\nW\n\nOvers16.4\n\nScore110 - 7\n\nOttneil Baartman to Shubham Ranjane, OUT! RUN OUT! A huge mix-up and Shubham Ranjane is a goner. It is a slower bumper, outside off. Shubham Ranjane miscues it towards mid on and ventures out looking for a single, but is caught in two minds here. Joshua Tromp charges in and throws it to the bowler, who gathers it and takes the bails off quickly at the non-striker's end.\n\nStrategic break! With 77 runs needed off the last 5 overs, the Seattle Orcas will need a few explosive overs right after this break to put pressure back on the opposition. These two batters have the capability to turn the game around but will need to focus on taking the game deep to maximize their chance. While for Texas Super Kings, a couple more wickets will probably put them closer to the winning line."

However, Finn Allen's explosive 77 off 30 balls took the San Francisco Unicorns to a comfortable six-wicket win.\n\nWith this victory, the San Francisco Unicorns remain in second place on the points table with nine points from six matches, while the Seattle Orcas have been officially eliminated from the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nTrending\n\nAlready qualified for the playoffs, the San Francisco Unicorns began their run chase of 153 runs at a blistering pace. They smashed 79 runs in the powerplay, thanks to Allen's 21-ball fifty. He struck 26 runs in the fifth over, bowled by Lungi Ngidi, which featured two sixes and three fours.\n\nMatthew Short, on the other hand, was dismissed by Imad Wasim in the seventh over after scoring 19 off 14 balls. Allen continued in the same vein, hitting two sixes off Harmeet Singh before being caught by Ryan Rickelton on the fifth ball of the eighth over. He scored 77 off 30 balls, leaving San Francisco at 98/2 after eight overs.\n\nUnicorns then lost two more wickets in consecutive overs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed for 10 off 16 balls in the 13th over, followed by Sherfane Rutherford in the 14th, who scored 17 off 8 balls. However, Josh Inglis and Corey Anderson guided San Francisco to a comfortable six-wicket win with 34 balls to spare.\n\nIn a must-win game, the Seattle Orcas faced a disastrous start after being invited to bat first. They lost both openers in the very first over: Ryan Rickelton was caught by Finn Allen on the first ball, and Aaron Jones was trapped lbw by Carmi le Roux.\n\nDespite an early setback, Seattle managed to score 48 runs in the powerplay, thanks to an aggressive counter-attack by Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya. They added 34 runs in the last two overs of the powerplay, bringing the score to 48/2.\n\nDe Kock reached his half-century off 28 balls by the 10th over. Alongside Jayasuriya, he added 31 runs off Pat Cummins' first two overs, pushing Seattle to 98/2 after 11 overs. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the 12th over as both De Kock (62 off 33) and Jayasuriya (31 off 33) were dismissed in quick succession by Brody Couch.\n\nHassan Khan then delivered a decisive blow to Seattle Orcas, as he struck thrice in his two consecutive overs. He dismissed Heinrich Klaasen (8 off 8) in the 14th over, and Harmeet Singh (3 off 7) and Keemo Paul (0 off 1) in the 16th over, reducing Seattle to 116/7.\n\nDe Kock reached his half-century off 28 balls by the 10th over.

        "body": "The Texas Super Kings: Led by Calvin Savage's all round performance, the Texas Super Kings handed the Seattle Orcas a comprehensive 37 run defeat in the final league match of the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nDespite Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya giving the Orcas a solid start in their run chase, the Texas Super Kings' bowlers, led by Ottneil Bartmann (3/20), Noor Ahmad (2/19) and Calvin Savage (2/23), dismantled the Seattle batting lineup.\n\nWith the match's conclusion, Seattle Orcas finished their campaign with six losses and a sole victory, whereas the Texas Super Kings who secured three wins and two losses (two no results) will play MI New York in the eliminator.\n\nTrending\n\nMirroring the first innings, the Seattle Orcas’ run chase lost Ryan Rickleton (0) off the first ball of the innings to Ottneil Bartman. Shehan Jayasuriya (24) joined Quinton de Kock (26), and the pair took control of the run chase. At the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 47/1.\n\nJayasuriya eventually fell to Savage in the seventh over after a 27-ball stint at the crease. Not long after, the dangerous Quinton de Kock was also dismissed, leaving the Orcas at 59/3 in the ninth over.\n\nFaced with a steep equation, the onus was on Heinrich Klaasen (4) and Matthew Bracewell (4) to steer the innings. However, both batters were outfoxed by spinners and dismissed for single digit. Mitchell Santner saw the back of Klaasen, while Bracewell was trapped lbw by Noor.\n\nComing together with the score at 67/5 in 10.4 overs, Shubham Ranjane (16) and Keemo Paul (25) labored to keep the Orcas in contention.\n\nHowever, Ranjane was run out and Keemo Paul was castled by Noor before the 17th over, comprehensively extinguishing the run chase. Ali Sheikh chipped in with a consolatory knock, but the Orcas fell well short, finishing at 140/9. Bartman took two wickets in the tail to finish with figures of 3/20.\n\nEarlier in the day. The Texas Super Kings lost opener Devon Conway (0) and Joshua Tromp (6) early in the innings, however Faf Du Plessis (37) was in fine form, smashing six boundaries and a six before he was scalped by Keemo Paul. At the end of the power play the Texas Super Kings were placed at 56/3.\n\nMilind Kumar (27) played a watchful knock, scoring nearly a run-a-ball before he became Paul’s second wicket of the day. The experienced all-rounders, Marcus Stoinis (11) and Mitchell Santner (15) both got starts, but failed to convert them into bigger scores, falling to Aryan Desai and Matthew Bracewell respectively.\n\nSavage (45*) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson, the pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings. Stevenson (17) struck a four and six to support Savage’s late innings fireworks, but was cleaned by Nandre Burger in the 18th.\n\nSavage hammered Bracewell for two consecutive maximums in the 16th over and went on to script a17 run over of Nande Burger’s 18th over to remain unbeaten and help the Texas Super Kings finish at 177/8.\n\nSavage (45*) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson, the pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings.

        "body": "Pakistan-born Hassan Khan delivered a match-winning cameo for the San Francisco Unicorns, securing their place in the Qualifier match of the ongoing Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024.\n\nWashington Freedom, after being asked to bat first, managed to score 174 runs for the loss of three wickets in 15.3 overs, thanks to the consistent drizzle. Opening batters Travis Head and skipper Steve Smith each scored 56 runs, forming a formidable 100-run opening stand.\n\nOn the bowling front, Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf struggled, conceding 20 runs in his two-over spell without taking a wicket. Corey Anderson, however, picked up two crucial wickets.\n\nThe Unicorns were set a revised target of 177 runs in 14 overs under the DLS method.\n\nTheir chase began on a rocky note, with opener Finn Allen falling to Akeal Hosein on the very first ball. Despite this early setback, Sanjay Krishnamurthi (79*) and Josh Inglis (45) kept the innings afloat with aggressive knocks.\n\nThe spotlight, however, was on Hassan Khan, who played a brilliant match-winning cameo of 32 runs off just 11 balls, including four boundaries and two sixes.\n\nHis late flourish ensured that the Unicorns chased down the target, losing four wickets in just 13.4 overs.\n\nThis victory propels the San Francisco Unicorns to the next round of the tournament, where they will once again face Washington Freedom in the Qualifier match scheduled for July 25th."

As a result, USA have also qualified for the T20 World Cup 2026 to be played in India.\n\nMeanwhile, after giving us some enthralling cricket action, the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 season is nearing its climax, with the four teams advancing to the knockout stage already confirmed, even though one group-stage match remains as of writing this between the Texas Super Kings and Seattle Orcas. This upcoming match will not influence the standings or the knockout phase though.\n\nFind Best Betting Tips and Predictions for Major League Cricket 2024 Here\n\nThe teams advancing to the MLC 2024 knockouts are Washington Freedom (WSF), San Francisco Unicorns (SFU), Texas Super Kings (TSK), and MI New York (MINY), as all the teams finished in top four in the MLC 2024 points table. Now many might wonder how does the Major League Cricket (MLC) playoffs format works. In this article, we take a look at the MLC 2024 Playoffs format.\n\nThe Major League Cricket format is very much similar to that of the most successful T20 league in the world, the Indian Premier League (IPL). Just IPL, there is Eliminator, there is Qualifier 1, however, the Qualifier 2 is called the Challenger, we will get to know more about it.\n\nEliminator in MLC 2024\n\nNow in the IPL, the playoffs phase begins with the Qualifier 1 between the top 2 teams in the points table with the winner of the match directly going to the final. However, in this case, in the MLC, we will have the Eliminator first between the 3rd and 4th placed team. The winner of the match of will progress into the playoffs further while the loser is completely out of the competition, just like the Eliminator match in the IPL.\n\nQualifier in MLC 2024\n\nNow, Major League Cricket’s Qualifier is equivalent of the Indian Premier League (IPL)’s Qualifier 1. The top 2 teams at the end of the league phase in the MLC 2024 points table will play in this match. And just the like IPL, the winner of this match will directly progress into the MLC 2024 Final while the losing team will have another opportunity.\n\nChallenger in MLC 2024\n\nIn the Indian Premier League (IPL), in the Qualifier 2, the winner of the Eliminator and the loser of the Qualifier 1 plays. It is exactly the same format here as well where the Eliminator winning team will take on the losing team from the Qualifier match and in the end, the winning team will qualify for the Final against Qualifier winner. And rather than calling it qualifier, they call it Challenger as it identifies the challenger team for the Qualifier winner in the MLC 2024 Final.\n\nELIMINATOR: Texas Super Kings vs MI New York – 25th July, 6 A.M Indian Standard Time (IST), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium\n\nQUALIFIER: Washington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns – 26th July, 6 A.M Indian Standard Time (IST), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium\n\nCHALLENGER: Winner of Eliminator vs Loser of Qualifier – 27 July, 6 A.M Indian Standard Time (IST), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium"

Dwayne Bravo’s experience with the ball will also be key on this strong batting wicket.\n\nTSK Team Form\n\nTexas Super Kings were unbeaten in four matches until their defeat to Washington Freedom on Friday.\n\nTexas Super Kings Predicted Playing 11\n\nDevon Conway (wk), Faf du Plessis (c), Aaron Hardie, Joshua Trump, Marcus Stoinis, Milind Kumar, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, Mohammad Mohsin, Noor Ahmad, Zia-ul-Haq\n\nSeattle Orcas Team News & Playing 11\n\nSOR Team News\n\nIt was another convincing defeat for Seattle Orcas on Saturday as they lost by six wickets with 34 balls remaining to San Francisco Unicorns. Irrespective of how this match goes, Seattle Orcas can not advance to the play-offs and will finish bottom of the table.\n\nSOR Team Batting\n\nAs one of only four players to have hit 200+ runs in the tournament so far, Ryan Rickelton will be a key wicket at the top of the order for Seattle Orcas in this match. Keeper-batter Quinton de Kock and skipper Heinrich Klaasen have had disappointing tournaments but de Kock did hit a half-century in Seattle’s last game.\n\nSOR Team Bowling\n\nIn spite of losing again, Seattle Orcas did put in a better bowling performance in their last game with only Michael Bracewell and Ali Sheikh going wicketless. Cameron Gannon has been their most consistent bowler across this year’s competition.\n\nSOR Team Form\n\nSeattle Orcas come into this fixture looking to avoid their fifth successive defeat.\n\nSeattle Orcas Predicted Playing 11\n\nRyan Rickelton, Aaron Jones, Quinton de Kock (wk), Shehan Jayasuriya, Heinrich Klaasen, Michael Bracewell, Harmeet Singh, Keemo Paul, Cameron Gannon, Lungi Ngidi, Ali Sheikh"
