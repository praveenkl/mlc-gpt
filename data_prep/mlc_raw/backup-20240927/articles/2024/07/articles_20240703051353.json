I have two T20 tournaments ahead of me--an MLC (Major League Cricket) organized by USA and the next is Canada's Global T20. I will play those two tournaments and see how it is going. After that, there is a Test series against Pakistan and I will play that series. That's the plan for now,\" Shakib said here today as he was leaving the country for USA to play MLC.\n\nShakib had below par T20 World Cup campaign this year, which encouraged his critics to lash out at him vehemently. They raised their voice high about his immediate retirement, citing the reason that at the age of 37, it would be tough for the allrounder to regain his form.\n\nEarlier, Shakib revealed that he would retire from the cricket after the Champions Trophy in 2025 but recently in an interview with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) he revealed that he wants to play another ODI World Cup which is in 2027.\n\nBut it looked he changed his plan again.\n\n\"I didn't really plan too much. I need to understand my physical condition. At this moment it is not possible for me to plan for the next three or four years. I think it's better to plan for three or six months. For the time being, my plan is for Pakistan series, then I will see what next for me,\" Shakib added.\n\nBangladesh won three matches of the group phase in T20 World Cup and moved up to the Supe 8 for only the second time in tournament's history. However they lost all three matches in Super 8 phase and even though they had the golden chance to make it semifinal, Bangladesh's safe cricket sank them at the end.\n\n\"May be we didn't play all out cricket. We didn't get the kind of results we expected or the kind of results we had a chance of getting. We fulfilled the initial (Super Eight) target, so it is successful from that point of view. It's a bit disappointing for us because we couldn't go to the semifinal.\"\n\nIn response to a query why they couldn't make it possible to make it semis, Shakib said, 'It is difficult to say. In fact, I am sure those who are there will decide that why we can't make it. The coach, captain, team and others who are in the cricket operations, board and others will discuss together to sort it out.\""

He will be plying his trade for Los Angeles Knight Riders, who finished last in the inaugural season last year. Shakib informed that he isn't thinking too far ahead, having only planned till the tour of Pakistan next month.\n\n“I don't have many plans. There are two T20 tournaments in front of me one is MLC and the other one is the Global T20 League in Canada and let me see where I stand after playing these two tournaments because I need to understand [how I feel],” Shakib was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.\n\n“There is international cricket and there is a series against Pakistan, and I am planning till that point of time and not planning beyond that. Now I don't have time to plan for three-four years and so planning for three to six months is better and later will think about my next plan and so till now I am planning till the Pakistan series,” the experienced cricketer added.\n\nAlso Read: Warner, Babar, Narine, Shakib among galaxy of stars to light up GT20 Canada 2024\n\nTaskin Ahmed apologized for missing the team bus: Shakib\n\nTaskin Ahmed was surprisingly left out of the playing XI in Bangladesh's crucial Super Eights fixture in the recently concluded T20 World Cup 2024 against eventual champions India in Antigua. A Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official had recently revealed that the pacer woke up late in the morning and missed the team bus. Shakib also spoke along those lines and said that the 29-year-old apologized for his negligence.\n\n“The team bus starts at a certain point and there is a rule for cricketers that team bus does not stop for anyone and if anyone misses it in that case he comes in the next car. The manager's car or a taxi is there and the support of transport was difficult in the West Indies. When Taskin arrived it was five to 10 minutes before the toss, and certainly it was difficult to pick him at that point in the team and it was difficult for him as well,” Shakib said.\n\nAlso Read: T20 World Cup 2024: Taskin Ahmed apologises for missing team bus after waking up late for India game\n\n“Taskin apologized to the team for that afterwards and everyone in the team took it normally because a man can mistake and anyone can commit unintentional mistake, and he accepted it and the thing ended at that point of time,” the cricketer said."

        "body": "Major League Cricket is returning with its second season after the grand success and launch of the league during its inaugural run in 2023. The 2024 season starts July 5, with the Championship Final taking place at Grand Prairie Stadium on July 28. Here’s your guide to the upcoming exciting season of the MLC in the USA.\n\nHow many teams are going to participate?\n\nJust like the inaugural season, the second season of the MLC will see all the six founding teams clashing against each other with the Seattle Orcas, MI New York, LA Knight Riders, Washington Freedom, San Francisco Unicorns and Texas Super Kings battling it out\n\nWhere is it going to be played?\n\nAfter the success that was the first season, the league will be played across the two venues which also hosted the matches last year - Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nHas the format changed?\n\nYes. The league's first season was played in a single round robin format with 15 league stages matches. However, the second season will see an increase to 21 league games, with each of the teams playing seven games instead of five last season. The tournament will then move to the playoff stages, which will follow the same format as the first season with a Qualifier, Challenger and Eliminator to be played before the summit clash.\n\nMLC has been given List A status. What does that mean?\n\nEarlier this year, the ICC awarded the MLC with List A status, making it only the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire the status from the game’s governing body. This basically means all the records, runs, wickets and stats acquired in the MLC will now be added to the official records of the format. It also means that MLC is now an official T20 League, much like the IPL or the SA20 or Big Bash League.\n\nHow long are the games?\n\nThe T20 format is a shortened version of cricket that lasts approx 3- 3 ½ hours.\n\nWhere can we watch MLC?\n\nTo cheer on your Seattle Orcas in person, all matches will be broadcast at all 5 locations at Flat Stick Pub (https://flatstickpub.com/locations/). For more info check out our watch party events on Facebook.\n\nKirkland\n\nRedmond\n\nPioneer Square\n\nSouth Lake Union\n\nBellingham\n\nSpokane\n\nThe broadcasters vary, so check your local listings to see if these are included in your channel package:"

The air is thick with anticipation, the sound of leather on willow echoes in our dreams, and suddenly, everyone's googling \"What's a googly?\" Yes, folks, Major League Cricket (MLC) is back for its sophomore innings, and it's about to turn the USA into a cricketing colosseum!\n\nPicture this: stadiums packed with fans donning team colors, the rhythmic chants of \"USA! USA!\" mixed with \"Howzat!\", and hot dogs sharing menu space with samosas. It's a cricketing carnival that's as American as apple pie... served with a side of mango chutney!\n\nMLC 2024 isn't just a tournament; it's a cultural phenomenon, a sports revolution, and quite possibly the best reason to call in sick to work this July. It's promising more googlies, yorkers, and sixes than you can shake a willow at. So, let's dive into this cricketing extravaganza that's about to hit American shores for a six!\n\nThe Teams - A Six-Pack of Cricketing Fury\n\n1.

Texas Super Kings: Everything's bigger in Texas, including the sixes!\n\nThe Galacticos of Googly\n\nHold onto your batting helmets, folks!

Nah, it's biceps from Jamaica, baby!\n\nSteve Smith: The only thing unorthodox about him is everything\n\nTrent Boult: He swings it more than a jazz band in New Orleans\n\nThe Colosseums of Cricket\n\n1. Church Street Park: Where prayers for sixesare frequently answered - (click here)\n\n2.

Whether you know your leg before wicket from your elbow before watch, MLC 2024 promises more entertainment than a Netflix binge. So, grab your popcorn (or cucumber sandwiches, if you're feeling proper), and come watch cricket history being made. It's going to be just like baseball... if baseball was interesting for more than 5 minutes at a time!\n\nNow, here's a googly you'll want to play: the Sulekha coupon! Think of it as your secret weapon, your ticket to cricket nirvana. By using the code 'SULEKHA2024', you're not just getting a 20% discount, you're practically stealing runs from the ticketing system! It's like hitting a six when you only needed a single - overachieving at its finest!\n\nBut wait, there's more! This isn't just any old coupon. Oh no, the 'SULEKHA2024' code is your VIP pass to the cricketing event of the year. It's like having Sachin Tendulkar as your personal batting coach, or Shane Warne teaching you to spin - it's that good! So don't let this googly of an opportunity slip through to the keeper.\n\nRemember, in cricket and in life, you miss 100% of the shots you don't play. And with the Sulekha coupon in your arsenal, you're already ahead of the game. It's time to pad up, step onto the pitch, and be part of American cricket history.\n\nHowzat for a summer plan? Now, off you go! May your tickets be cheap, your seats be prime, and may the odds be ever in your favor (wrong franchise, but you get the idea). See you at the cricket!"
