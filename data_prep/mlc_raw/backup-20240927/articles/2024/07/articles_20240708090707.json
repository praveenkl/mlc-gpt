        "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nOff the back off an impressive opening game win, a well-rounded Washington Freedom squad continue their 2024 Major League Cricket campaign against a Texas Super Kings looking to bounce back from an opening game defeat.\n\nDATE & TIME: Monday 8th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:30pm / USA PT – 12:30pm / West Indies – 2:30pm / UK – 8:30pm / South Africa – 9:30pm / Tuesday 9th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:30am / India – 1:00am / Bangladesh – 1:30am / Australia – 5:30am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 33c or 91.4 F with the possibility of a thunderstorm\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM FORM: A STRONG SQUAD\n\nIn their opening game of the tournament, the Washington Freedom managed to defeat defending champions MI New York in Morrisville with a four-run DLS victory. MI New York scored 154-9 with US international Saurabh Netravalkar taking 3-24 off his four overs before Steve Smith’s unbeaten 46 from 28 balls saw Freedom home by a slender margin before the rain came.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLWW\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: EXPERIENCED IN ABUNDANCE\n\nThe Texas Super Kings, built with the help of so-called ‘Dad’s Army’ Indian Premier League franchise Chennai Super Kings, began their season with a 12-run loss to last season’s wooden spoon outfit Los Angeles Knight Riders in Dallas with Devon Conway’s 53 runs from 39 deliveries not enough to see TSK reach the target of 163.\n\nLAST THREE: LLLWL\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Washington Freedom have a squad heavily influenced by Australians with aforementioned captain Steve Smith leading the likes of Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell among others. Head missed out with just one run from seven balls against MI New York but that is not expected to be a common occurrence for their Test number five and Head to top score for Freedom is always a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, they have a well-rounded attack, too, with plenty of spin options but also the pace of Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar. Ferguson took 1-28 the other day and his bowling has been difficult to hit for a while now, famously taking 3-0 from four overs for New Zealand against Papua New Guinea last month, so Ferguson to be Freedom’s best bowler in this one would be a good shout.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nAs mentioned, there is experience throughout the TSK side but the downside to that is there is perhaps not bundles of energy and that was shown in their fairly slow chase the other day. If they are to up the tempo then a lot will rest on the shoulders of Aaron Hardie and Marcus Stoinis. Stoinis didn’t have the best of starts with two from six but if he gets going he is a formidable hitter and Stoinis to hit two or more sixes in any innings, especially one where he needs to respond, would be a reasonable expectation.\n\nIn the bowling department, the Super Kings lack a bit of quality experience with Zia-ul-Haq their best bowler from the other day, taking 2-16. Spin is likely to be their biggest threat against the likes of Head and Smith, and even Maxwell, though, so Mohammad Mohsin, despite going wicket-less the other day, would be tipped to take two or more wickets here.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS TEXAS SUPER KINGS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThere are quite a few issues in the Texas Super Kings side and there is probably too much reliance on the opening pair of Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway to score their runs. That means they will likely take their time to get set and TSK having the better opening stand, or at least the biggest with the pace of Head’s innings likely to be a major factor in the game, would be a good bet but Washington Freedom, albeit not overly convincing against MI New York the other day, would still be viewed as favourites for the match."

Jason Roy and Sunil Narine got out cheaply. After their dismissals, Unmukt Chand played a fine knock of 68 runs in 45 balls. He hit 6 fours and 3 huge sixes during his innings. Nitish Kumar also played a nice cameo of 26 runs in 17 balls to help LA Knight Riders get to 162 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Devon Conway and Faf du Plessis started off really well for Texas Super Kings. They stitched a partnership of 30 runs for the first wicket. A couple of wickets fell in quick succession in the middle order and Super Kings all of a sudden looked in deep waters. Devon Conway kept on batting well and made 53 runs off 39 balls but he barely got any support at the other end as Texas Super Kings were restricted to 150 for 8 in 20 overs, losing the match by 12 runs.\n\nCurrent Form San Francisco Unicorns:\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns played poorly in the previous edition of the Major League Cricket. They finished at the 5th position on points table after league stages. San Francisco Unicorns managed to win only 2 matches out of the 5 games they participated in.\n\nThe top run scorer for San Francisco Unicorns in the previous edition was Corey Anderson with 190 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for San Francisco Unicorns in the previous edition was Liam Plunkett with 7 scalps under his belt.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have big names in their squad like Pat Cummins, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Henry, Haris Rauf and Josh Inglis. They should be able to make it to the Playoffs easily, considering the strength they have in both batting as well as the bowling department.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Jake Fraser-McGurk - He is one of the most exciting players in T20 format. Jake Fraser-McGurk played superbly in the recently concluded Indian Premier League and he will look to continue his good form in the Major League Cricket as well.\n\n2. Pat Cummins - He picked up 2 hattricks in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Cummins is expected to continue his merry ways with the ball in Major League Cricket.\n\nWicket Takers T20"

The high-voltage clash is scheduled at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nSF vs LAS: Team Previews\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nLed by Corey Anderson, San Francisco Unicorns will begin their MLC 2024 campaign with the much-anticipated clash against Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nTheir biggest strength lies in their batting, with destructive batters like Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short and Josh Inglis set to represent them in the tournament.\n\nThe eyes will also be on Sherfane Rutherford, who was impressive for West Indies in the recently concluded T20 World Cup.\n\nThe Unicorns also have a ruthless bowling department, studded with acclaimed fast bowlers Pat Cummins and Haris Rauf alongside Matt Henry, Liam Plunkett and Abrar Ahmed, ensuring enough potential and international experience.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nLAKR defeated TSK in their last game [X]\n\nOn the other hand, the Knight Riders had a dream start to the MLC 2024, opening their account in the points table with an emphatic 12-run win over Texas Super Kings.\n\nWhile Unmukt Chand starred for them with the bat, exceptional bowling performances from Spencer Johnson and Ali Khan helped them defend a 162-run total.\n\nHowever, barring these players, the Knight Riders have a legendary all-round trio of Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell and Sunil Narine who are expected to play key roles in this match.\n\nFurthermore, USA's Nitish R Kumar and David Miller will be pivotal for their batting success alongside renowned English opener Jason Roy.\n\nSF vs LAS: Match details & live streaming\n\nSF vs LAS: Grand Prairie Stadium pitch report\n\nThere could be a hint of assistance for the fast bowlers as the ball will nip around at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. However, given the track's even pace, the batters can be effective if they play on top of the bounce.\n\nThe average run rate in T20Is at this venue has been a reasonably good 8.21. So, we expect a moderate to high scoring affair, with pacers from both sides playing a crucial role in this game.\n\nSF vs LAS: Probable Playing XIs\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Finn Allen, Matthew Short, Jahmar Hamilton (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Corey Anderson (C), Tajinder Singh, Pat Cummins, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Brody Couch\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Jason Roy, Sunil Narine (C), Unmukt Chand (WK), Shakib Al Hasan, Nitish R Kumar, David Miller, Andre Russell, Derone Davis, Corne Dry, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan\n\nSF vs LAS: Fantoss fantasy tips\n\nSF vs LAS: Winner Prediction\n\nConsidering the strength of both teams, we reckon Los Angeles Knight Riders will emerge victorious in this match."

        "date": "Mon Jul  8 11:49:00 2024",
        "body": "oi-Aditya K Halder\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns began their campaign in the second season of Major League Cricket -- MLC 2024 -- with an impressive six-wicket win over Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Sunday.\n\nThis match marked the first defeat of this edition for the Knight Riders, who had begun their campaign with a comeback win over Texas Super Kings in the MLC 2024 opener.\n\nOpting to bat first, the Knight Riders couldn't build substantial partnerships. Opener Jason Roy contributed a brisk 26 off 18 balls before being bowled by Plunkett. Despite small contributions from Sunil Narine (6), Nitish Kumar (20), and David Miller (24), the team struggled to maintain momentum.\n\nShakib Al Hasan stood out with a solid 35 off 26 balls, but it was Andre Russell's explosive unbeaten 40 off 25 balls that provided a late surge, helping LAKR to a total of 165 for 6 in their 20 overs.\n\nThe Unicorns' bowling attack was led by Brody Couch and Haris Rauf, both claiming two wickets each. Couch finished with impressive figures of 2 for 24, while Rauf took 2 for 38. Their disciplined bowling ensured that LAKR's batsmen could never fully capitalize on their starts.\n\nIn response, the Unicorns got off to a shaky start, losing Jake Fraser-McGurk early for 9 runs. However, New Zealand opener Finn Allen and Matthew Short took control of the chase.\n\nAllen's aggressive 63 off 37 balls and Short's blistering 58 off 26 balls formed a match-winning partnership of 116 runs for the second wicket. Their combined assault left the LAKR bowlers struggling, particularly targeting Spencer Johnson, who despite taking three wickets, conceded 36 runs in his four overs.\n\nVeteran spinner Sunil Narine managed to take a wicket, finishing with 1 for 39, but the rest of the LAKR bowlers failed to make significant inroads. The Unicorns achieved the target comfortably, reaching 166 for 4 in just 15.2 overs, sealing a comprehensive victory.\n\nWith this dominant performance, the San Francisco Unicorns have set a high standard for their season ahead. The LA Knight Riders will need to regroup and strategize better for their upcoming matches to bounce back from this defeat."

However, Finn Allen looked eager to make a quick meal of the target. The right-handed opener smashed Russell for two consecutive sixes in the fifth over, followed by three consecutive sixes of Shakib Al Hassan in the next over, to complete five maximums in just as many deliveries. At the end of the powerplay the Unicorns were firmly in the driver’s seat with a score of 67/1.\n\nOpener Matthew Short switched gears following the powerplay, striking Corne Dry for two more sixes in the seventh over. In the eighth over, Fin Allen brought up his half-century in 23 deliveries, while Matthew Short continued to clear the ropes with ease, bringing up his half-century soon after in 23 balls too, comprising five sixes and three fours.\n\nWhen the colossal 116-run stand between Allen and Short was finally dented by Sunil Narine in the 12th over, the Unicorns were cruising to their target, needing only 29 runs in 48 balls. While Finn Allen became Spencer Johnson’s second wicket of the night in the 13th over, Josh Inglis (15), Corey Anderson (11), and Hassan Khan (2) helped the Unicorns reach their target in 15.2 overs.\n\nSpencer Johnson was the leading wicket-taker for the LA Knight Riders with figures of 3/36.\n\nEarlier, San Francisco Unicorns bowlers did well to restrict the LA Knight Riders. By the end of the powerplay, LA Knight Riders were 42/2, having lost the wickets of Sunil Narine (6) and Unmukt Chand (0). Opener Jason Roy (26) looked threatening and cracked four boundaries in his 18-ball stint before he was cleaned up by Liam Plunkett in the seventh over.\n\nThe experienced Shakib Al Hassan (35), and Nitish Kumar (20) came together to put on the biggest partnership of the innings. The pair put on 45 runs in 31 deliveries in the middle overs before Abrar Ahmed and Brody Couch dismissed the pair in consecutive overs.\n\nEarlier, San Francisco Unicorns bowlers did well to restrict the LA Knight Riders.

With the bat, skipper Steven Smith led by example.\n\nWhen it comes to Texas, they lost to Los Angeles Knight Riders in their opening game.

        "body": "Andre Russell was at his best as he smashed Haris Rauf for a gigantic six during the San Francisco Unicorns vs Los Angeles Knight Riders match of the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nUnicorns skipper Corey Anderson won the toss and opted to bowl first. Rauf, in his first over, dismissed Sunil Narine with a back-of-the-length off-cutter. Half-centurion of the previous game, Unmukt Chand, departed for a five-ball duck as Brody Couch took his wicket. Jason Roy and Shakib Al Hasan hit a few boundaries, taking the Knight Riders to 42/2 after the powerplay overs.\n\nLos Angeles Knight riders’ middle-order performance\n\nLiam Plunkett was introduced into the attack and he delivered with Roy’s wicket. The English opener scored 26 runs from 18 balls. Nitish Kumar and Shakib shared a crucial partnership in the middle overs.\n\nIn the 12th over, Pakistan spinner Abrar Ahmed dismissed Shakib, who scored 35 runs from 26 balls. Couch returned to dismiss Hassan Khan for a 19-ball 20. David Miller hit a six and a four before being deceived by Rauf’s slower ball, scoring 24 runs from 18 balls. Russell hit a few sixes in his 25-ball 40, taking the Knight Riders’ score to 165/6.\n\nAlso READ: Star players from IPL 2024 who will feature in the MLC 2024\n\nAndre Russell’s massive six off Haris Rauf\n\nIn one of the most thrilling moments of the match, Russell showcased his power-hitting ability against Rauf. On the fourth last ball of the Knight Riders’ innings, Rauf bowled a length ball that sat up nicely for Russell.\n\nThe West Indies all-rounder unleashed a powerful swing, connecting perfectly and sending the ball soaring over midwicket. The shot was so immense that it traveled an astonishing 107 meters, clearing the stadium and leaving the crowd in awe.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns’ chase and Finn Allen’s explosive knock\n\nIn response, the Unicorns lost Jake Fraser-McGurk early to Spencer Johnson. Finn Allen attacked, hitting Russell for a four and two sixes, and three consecutive sixes off Shakib, reaching 67/1 after the powerplay. Matt Short joined in, hitting Corne Dry for two sixes. Allen scored a fifty off 25 balls in the eighth over, and Short reached his half-century off 23 balls in the 11th over.\n\nNarine broke the second-wicket partnership, bowling Short for 58 runs from 26 balls. Johnson dismissed Allen for 63 runs from 37 balls in the next over. Narine bowled two no-balls and was hit for a six by Corey Anderson. Johnson took another wicket, dismissing Josh Inglis.

Keep reading for our compilation of all the five-wicket hauls achieved in MLC so far, with the page being last updated 6th July 2024, a few games into the MLC 2024 season in the USA.\n\nSEE ALSO: List of top online sports betting websites\n\nWith cricket not being super popular in the USA so far, it wasn’t very surprising that the first MLC 5-wicket haul was taken by an overseas player in South Africa’s Wayne Parnell. However, it didn’t take too much time for the local talent to shine as former USA captain Saurabh Netravalkar joined the MLC all 5-fers list soon after, both in the MLC 2023 season itself.\n\nList of 5-wickets hauls in Major League Cricket\n\nSr.NameTeamDateFigures1Wayne ParnellSeattle Orcas21 Jul 20235/202Saurabh NetravalkarWashington Freedom22 Jul 20236/93TBDTBDTBDTBD4TBDTBDTBDTBD5TBDTBDTBDTBD6TBDTBDTBDTBD\n\nWayne Parnell (Seattle Orcas)\n\nIn a crucial match against the Texas Super Kings, Wayne Parnell emerged as the hero for the Orcas.

He won the Man of the Match award in this game at Morrisville.\n\nSEE ALSO: List of best fantasy sports websites in India\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom)\n\nIt seemed like the Morrisville pitch was good for bowlers as the very next day of Parnell’s MLC 5-fer, Netravalkar, the Indian-American left-arm pacer, etched his name in MLC history by claiming the first ever six-wicket haul in the league. His spell of 6/9 against the San Francisco Unicorns left the opposition batsmen bewildered, paving the way for the MOM award after a 30-run win for his side. He picked the wickets of Matthew Wade, Marcus Stoinis, Shadab Khan, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf and Chaitanya Bishnoi.\n\nThe ongoing 2024 MLC season promises to be even more exciting, with established stars and emerging talents vying for bowling supremacy. We can expect more diverse bowling attacks with fresh talent pumped into the MLC 2024 squads, a greater pressure to perform at the highest stage, and much more.
