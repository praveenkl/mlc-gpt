At 113/6 the Texas side seemed to be in trouble with the loss of constant wickets. This is when Colin Savage and Cameron Stevenson added 43 runs for the 7th wicket. Colin Savage was not out on 45 off 27 balls to help Texas reach 177/6 from their 20 overs.\n\nJust like Texas in the first innings, Seattle lost the wicket of Ryan Rickelton for a first-ball duck to Ottniel Baartman. Quinton De Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya then added 52 runs for the 2nd wicket before the wheels came off. The loss of Jayasuriya for 24 dismissed by Colin Savage says Seattle lost 4 wickets for 15 runs.\n\nFrom there the Texas bowlers didn’t take their foot off the pedal as they kept taking wickets at regular intervals. With figures of 3/20 from his 4 overs, Baartman was the best bowler for Texas Super Kings.",

With a couple of days left at the start of the tournament, we at OneCricket will take a deeper delve into the MI New York side.\n\nThe MI New York played excellent cricket in the previous edition. Even after an average start to their campaign, MINY peaked at the right moment and made it to the summit clash of the tournament. In the final, Nicholas Pooran played one of the best T20 knocks and made the team the first-ever MLC champions.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at the MINY squad for the 2024 season and try to figure out their strengths and weaknesses ahead of the season.\n\nHere is a look at the MI New York squad for MLC 2024.\n\nBatters: Tim David, Monank Patel, Nicholas Pooran, Heath Richards, Shayan Jahangir, Steven Taylor\n\nAll-rounders: Dewald Brevis, Ruben Clinton, Kieron Pollard, Rashid Khan, Romario Shepherd\n\nBowlers: Trent Boult, Ehsan Ali, Noshthush Kenjige, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Rushil Ugarkar\n\nStrengths of MI New York for MLC 2024\n\nBrilliant Pace Unit\n\nTrent Boult will be leading the pace attack of MI New York [X]\n\nTrent Boult, Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje will be in charge of the pace department for MI New York in this edition. These three functioning together can be lethal against any batting line-up in the tournament. Alongside the three genuine pacers, MI have Romario Shepherd, who could play a supporting role and also contribute with the bat for the team.\n\nBalanced Spin Department\n\nWhile having a very potent and fear-striking pace attack, the MI New York team can also boast of a balanced spin department. Rashid Khan will be their prime spinner, and there are no questions about his skills and what he brings to the table in this format. Nosthush Kenjige will be aiding Rashid, and we have seen in the recently concluded World Cup that Kenjige can be a very efficient bowler in the middle overs. Alongside a powerful pace attack, the spin department also looks adequate to make run-scoring for the opposition batters a problem.\n\nPowerful middle-order\n\nMI New York will have Nicholas Pooran, Dewald Brevis, Kieron Pollard, and Tim David in the middle order. These four batters should be enough to strike fear in the minds of the opposition bowlers. These batters have the ability to decimate the opposition with power-hitting and change the complexion of a match at any stage. Besides these four, MINY also has Monank Patel, Rashid Khan, and Romario Shepherd, players who can be used around that powerhouse in the game's situation and the playing conditions.\n\nWeaknesses of MI New York for MLC 2024\n\nShayan Jahangir, Monank Patel and Steven Taylor will be the players MI New York will be looking to use as their openers in the tournament. While Shayan Jahangir and Monank Patel are stable batters, sometimes their scoring rate can be an issue for the team. On the other hand, Steven Taylor, who is a power hitter at the top, suffers from a bit of inconsistency. So, the MI team in MLC will depend a lot on their fire power in the middle in order to see them through most of the games.\n\nMI New York Predicted XI for the first match",

    "body": "As the only small market in the six-team Major League Cricket, Seattle Orcas has an audacious plan to build its brand.\n\nIn a nod to the Dallas Cowboys, the world's most profitable sports team according to Forbes, the Orcas aim to become 'America's Team' in MLC - the lucrative pro T20 league that has just started a pivotal second season.\n\n\"We really are thinking about it for the long-term,\" Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar told me in a phone interview. \"We are not here thinking about MLC for the next five years and just saying 'let's get some value and move on'.\n\n\"There is no reason why we need to restrict this to just Seattle or the Pacific Northwest.\"\n\nForbesAmerica's Major League Cricket Set To Ride Momentum Of T20 World Cup\n\nMuch like the Seattle Sounders in Major League Soccer, whom Somasegar is part of the ownership group, the Orcas have encouraged passionate fans to get together and form the 'Pod Squad'.\n\n\"The squad is our way of saying we're going to get a group of people together who are excited about Seattle Orcas,\" said Somasegar, who has lived in Seattle for over three decades. \"And we think the 'Pod Squad' should exist not just in Seattle, but around the country.\n\n\"One guy from the Bay Area recently reached out to us and said that he had been watching MLC since it started. He said 'the way you guys have been inclusive, I'm a fan of your team more than any other. I like what you're doing and I want to be part of you'.\n\n\"So that's what we want to do and that's what we mean by becoming 'America's Team'.\"\n\nWhile inventiveness has made the Orcas stand out so far in the fledgling competition, cementing roots in the northwest seaport city will be vital for long-term success of the franchise.\n\nThe Orcas are an outlier compared to the other franchises based in the major locales of Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Washington DC and Dallas (Texas).\n\nSeattle beat out Atlanta and Chicago to complete the inaugural list of teams. As I reported recently, Atlanta and Chicago are set to be part of an expanded MLC in the coming seasons, while a move into Canada is also potentially on the cards.\n\nForbesChicago And Atlanta Could Be The Next Franchises In Major League Cricket\n\nParochialism is an advantage for the Orcas nestled in a relatively smaller market as underlined by the franchise being given more press coverage than its rivals. Exposure might be a bit easier for Orcas, but the hierarchy is keen to grow cricket from the ground up.\n\n\"We need to put a lot of effort into the community to not only get the right level of interest and excitement for the sport, but to also show kids that cricket can be a choice for them,\" said Somasegar, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group having spent 27 years working at Microsoft.\n\n\"We have this notion called 'cricket in a box', where we go to schools and show the basics of cricket. We're seeing early signs of traction. Our goal is to have cricket programs in schools.\n\n\"We need to cultivate cricket throughout the year because that's what is required for this sport to have a chance to be mainstream over a period of time.\"\n\nLike its debut season, where MLC exceeded financial expectations, the tournament is only being played in Dallas, the heartbeat of American cricket, and the more modest ground in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThere are plans amid an expanded MLC - played in a home and away format - for each franchise to have its own cricket stadium.\n\nA home ground for the Orcas has been planned at King County’s Marymoor Park, around 15 miles from Seattle, and likely to hold about 6000-8000 fans.\n\nIt is hoped to be ready by the 2026 season and possibly become a venue for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, where cricket will make its first Olympic appearance since 1900.\n\n\"My hope is Seattle has a stadium up and running by then because we have as much potential to host Olympic (cricket) games as anyone else,\" Somasegar said. \"That will be another great opportunity to showcase the sport in this country.\"\n\nThe Orcas are out to go one better after losing last year's final to MI New York, but lost the rematch in the opening game of this season.\n\nLike every other team, the Orcas have a mixture of international stars and local talent. Big names include big-hitting South Africans Heinrich Klaasen and Quinton de Kock, along with American sensation Aaron Jones who lit up the T20 World Cup.\n\nFor India-born Somasegar, building the blocks of a cricket franchise in his adopted home has become a dream come true.\n\n\"I grew up with cricket and derived so much pleasure from it in my life,\" he said. \"The vast majority of people in the U.S. have not experienced cricket, so this is building the sport from the ground up which is exciting.\n\n\"In Seattle, we have the loudest and most passionate sports fans in the country. There are a lot of great things happening here with technology and having big global companies in our backyard.\n\n\"It's a great place for cricket to be and it's satisfying playing a small role in this journey.\"",
    "summary": "**Seattle Orcas' Ambitious Plan**: The Seattle Orcas, the only small market team in the six-team MLC, aim to become \"America's Team\" by building a brand that resonates beyond Seattle and the Pacific Northwest.\n\n**\"Pod Squad\" Initiative**: The Orcas have encouraged fans to form the \"Pod Squad\", a group of passionate fans who can come together to support the team, not just in Seattle but across the country.\n\n**Community Focus**: The franchise is focused on growing cricket from the ground up by putting in effort to get kids interested in the sport and introducing \"cricket in a box\" programs in schools.\n\n**Stadium Plans**: A home ground for the Orcas is planned at King County's Marymoor Park, which is expected to hold 6,000-8,000 fans and be ready by the 2026 season.

    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns began their 2024 Major League Cricket season with an impressive six-wicket defeat of the Los Angeles Knight Riders in their opening match, whilst the Texas Super Kings suffered a defeat to LAKR before perhaps being saved by the rain for a no result against the Washington Freedom.\n\nDATE & TIME: Wednesday 10th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:00pm / USA PT – 12:00pm / West Indies – 2:00pm / UK – 8:00pm / South Africa – 9:00pm / Thursday 11th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:00am / India – 12:30am / Bangladesh – 1:00am / Australia – 5:00am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 34c or 93.2 F with clear, sunny skies\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: SPEEDY SAN FRANCISCO\n\nIn the inaugural season of Major League Cricket last year, the San Francisco Unicorns finished fifth with two victories and three defeats in their five matches. This time, though, the Unicorns demolished LAKR. They held them to just 165-6 in their 20 overs before chasing that down with six wickets to spare in just 15.2 overs with excellent innings’ from Finn Allen and Matt Short.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLWL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: DAD’S ARMY\n\nWith the influence of the so-called ‘Dad’s Army’ of the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League, the Texas Super Kings were beaten by 12 runs by LAKR in their opening game with TSK making just 150-8 in their 20 overs before then scoring 203-5 against the Washington Freedom. The rain helped them out, though, with the Freedom already on 62-0 in just four overs.\n\nLAST THREE: ALLLW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns were extremely impressive with both bat and ball in their defeat of LAKR. Their top four of Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Short and Josh Inglis will likely outscore anyone and a bet on the Unicorns to post a total in advance of 200, if they bat first, would be good value as they can go hard until quite late in the order with Liam Plunkett in at nine.\n\nFormer England international Plunkett performed his excellent ‘middle overs’ role well again in their opener as he took the wicket of former teammate Jason Roy with just the third ball outside of the powerplay. With TSK’s lineup structured to take the game deep, Plunkett will be pivotal and it would therefore be worthwhile to back Plunkett to be the Unicorns’ top bowler.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIn their opening encounter, the Texas Super Kings took seven wickets against LAKR but their most threatening bowler, Marcus Stoinis, picked up two wickets but went for 37 runs in his three overs. The most control was shown by Pakistani seamer Zia-ul-Haq and him to be their best bowler, once again, in what is a fairly weak attack, would appear a good bet for this one.\n\nWith the bat, TSK will have to think about upping the run rate with Faf du Plessis’ impressive century the other day still looking like it wouldn’t have been enough to defeat Washington. Stoinis found some touch with 29 off 18 and the Aussie all-rounder to continue to grow into the tournament with a 30+ score here would be worth having a go on.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS VS TEXAS SUPER KINGS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThe volatility in Twenty20 cricket means that tactical trends can be quite sweeping and come in quite quickly before fading just as fast. What is a point to mention here is that the top four of the San Francisco Unicorns features four of the modern-day white-ball players where they go hard from the off, whilst Devon Conway and Du Plessis open up for a TSK side looking to pragmatically get games won. There is perhaps no right or wrong way if you are eventually successful but it has to be said that the Unicorns, on a pitch now producing some very high scores, should simply be favoured to outscore their opposition.",
    "summary": "The San Francisco Unicorns have started their 2024 Major League Cricket season with a six-wicket victory over the Los Angeles Knight Riders, while the Texas Super Kings suffered a defeat to LAKR and then had a no result against the Washington Freedom due to rain.\n\nThe Unicorns restricted LAKR to 165-6 in 20 overs and then chased down the target in 15.2 overs, thanks to excellent innings from Finn Allen and Matt Short. The Texas Super Kings, on the other hand, were beaten by 12 runs by LAKR in their opening game, scoring only 150-8 in 20 overs.\n\nThe article provides betting analysis for the upcoming match between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings. The Unicorns are favored to post a total above 200 if they bat first, and Liam Plunkett is tipped to be their top bowler. For the Texas Super Kings, Zia-ul-Haq is expected to be their best bowler, and Marcus Stoinis is predicted to score 30+ runs.\n\nThe expert prediction is that the San Francisco Unicorns will outscore the Texas Super Kings in the upcoming match, given the Unicorns' strong top four and the high-scoring nature of the pitch.",

    "date": "Mon Jul  8 21:32:52 2024",
    "body": "Former India U-19 World Cup winning captain Unmukt Chand has opened up on his absence from USA's squad for the recently-concluded T20 World Cup. Chand took retirement from Indian cricket in 2021 before shifting base to the USA for better cricketing opportunities. After playing in the inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC), as well as other franchise tournaments, Chand became eligible to play for the USA. He had also expressed his wish of playing against India in the T20 World Cup, only to be left out of the squad.\n\nChand revealed that he was shocked after being left out of T20 World Cup squad, added that he had a feeling of being \"sucked inside\".\n\n\"That wasn't an ideal situation to be in. Because personally for me, this was what I had dreamed for the last three years. Obviously, it was a big shock. And it took me time to sort of come to terms with it.

I'm not even thinking about it,\" he added.\n\nChand, 31, has a point to prove, and started off the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) - USA's franchise T20 league - with a swashbuckling half-century.\n\nInterestingly, Chand's present MLC franchise is Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), who are owned by the Knight Riders group. Many might remember that Chand's downfall started when he was famously clean bowled by Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Brett Lee in the opening ball of IPL 2013. He made 68 off 45 balls, hitting six 4s and three 6s.",

    "date": "Tue Jul  9 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "The West Indies begin a three-match Test series against England on Wednesday which, regardless of the outcome, will give them an advantage before the two Tests against the Proteas next month.\n\nWhile the West Indies will be well up to speed with the Test format, by contrast, a large chunk of the 16 South African players named in the Test squad on Monday are either playing in the Major League Cricket T20 tournament in the US or not at all. Only David Bedingham, Wiaan Mulder and Matthew Breetzke are contracted on the county circuit.\n\nAt least that trio will have some first class matches under the belt and in Bedingham’s case, excellent form. Proteas coach Shukri Conrad said in a chat he had with Bedingham last week he told him to “save some runs for us”, after the 30-year-old surged to the top of the County Championship Division One run scorer’s list with an aggregate of 926 runs in 14 innings for Durham.\n\nHe has made five centuries and two half-centuries in that sequence, proving the decision to call him up for the Test squad last summer was overdue.\n\nBedingham’s form will be crucial, given he has rhythm in the longer format, something the MLC contracted players and those in South Africa will need to achieve through training camps and the sole warm-up match the squad will have in Trinidad before the first Test, which starts on August 7.\n\n“We have the luxury of a warm-up game and we have 10 days in Trinidad before the first Test,” said Conrad.\n\nPreparation for previous series against the West Indies and India last year were less than a week, so Conrad’s excitement about having 10 days is understandable.\n\n“You have to roll with the punches, this is the modern world. I’m comfortable that guys in America can take the flight across and we have a week’s preparation before the first Test. It is what it is and we will make it work.”\n\nThe build-up to the first Test between the West Indies and England that starts at Lord’s on Wednesday has been dominated by Jimmy Anderson, who is playing his 188th and final Test. That has helped overshadow the threat the West Indies pose, particularly with the ball.\n\nThough robbed of Kemar Roach, who was ruled out of the series with a knee injury, the West Indies still field a potent pace bowling trio in Jayden Seales, Alzarri Joseph and young sensation Shamar Joseph. The latter inspired the West Indies to their memorable victory over Australia in Brisbane earlier this year taking 7/68 in the second innings of that match.\n\n“They have a nice [set] of fast bowlers and having won in Australia they will have added confidence,” said Conrad.\n\nHe had a first-hand look at Seales and Joseph last season when the pair toured South Africa with a West Indies A team, so there will be no surprises there. Much like England will have noted in their preparation, the West Indies’ batting isn’t as strong.\n\n“There might be some frailties in the batting department that we can expose and exploit,” said Conrad.\n\nThe main frailty is inexperience. Among the batters, three haven’t played a Test, while three others — Kavem Hodge, Alick Athanaze and Kirk McKenzie — have a combined nine Tests between them.\n\nThey will be heavily reliant on captain Kraigg Brathwaite, former skipper Jason Holder, who wasn’t in Australia because he was contracted to the International League T20 in the UAE at the time, and wicketkeeper Joshua da Silva for their runs.",
    "summary": "* A large chunk of South African players named in the Test squad are currently playing in the Major League Cricket (MLC) T20 tournament in the US.\n* These players will need to adjust to the Test format quickly, as they will not have much preparation time before the two Tests against the West Indies next month.\n* The MLC contracted players will have to rely on training camps and a sole warm-up match in Trinidad to get ready for the longer format.\n* Coach Shukri Conrad is optimistic about the team's preparation, citing the luxury of a warm-up game and 10 days in Trinidad before the first Test.",

    "body": "Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) won their first match in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024, edging out Texas Super Kings (TSK) by 12 runs at the Grand Prairie Stadium. The match witnessed a dramatic turn of events, with Andre Russell’s bizarre dismissal adding a touch of misfortune to the Knight Riders’ hard-fought victory.\n\nLA Knight Riders sets competitive target\n\nBatting first, the Knight Riders posted a commendable total of 162/7 in their 20 overs. Unmukt Chand anchored the innings with a well-composed 68 runs, while Nitish Kumar chipped in with a valuable 26. The Super Kings’ bowling attack, spearheaded by Zia-ul-Haq‘s economical spell of 2/16, did well to restrict the flow of runs.\n\nAndre Russell’s bizarre dismissal\n\nThe turning point of the Knight Riders’ innings arrived in the 14th over. The big-hitting Dre Russ, known for his explosive batting, had a forgettable outing. Facing a yorker from Gerald Coetzee angling away from his body, Russell attempted a flick but ended up dislodging his own stumps with the bat while trying to play the shot. This comical yet crucial dismissal restricted him to a mere 10 runs off 5 deliveries.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Derone Davis takes a screamer to dismiss Joshua Tromp in TSK vs LAKR game at MLC 2024\n\nAli Khan shines for LAKR\n\nDespite Russell’s unfortunate exit, the Knight Riders bowlers rose to the occasion in the second innings. Right-arm pacer Ali Khan emerged as the hero, weaving a web of deception with his accurate fast bowling. His impressive spell of 4/33 put immense pressure on the Super Kings batters.\n\nChasing a target of 163, TSK started brightly with opener Devon Conway scoring a vital half-century (53 runs). However, the lack of substantial partnerships from other batters hampered their progress. The Knight Riders’ bowling attack, with Ali Khan leading the charge, maintained tight lines and lengths, stifling the Super Kings’ scoring rate. In the end, they fell short of the target by 12 runs, managing only 150/8 in their allotted 20 overs.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings shared the honours after their match in Major League Cricket 2024 at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina on Monday had to be called off due to heavy rain.\n\nSteve Smith and Travis Head had powered us to 62/0 in four overs after a rollicking start to the chase. Head hit two sixes and four fours in his unbeaten 32 off just 12 balls whereas Smith remained unconquered at 26 in only 13 balls striking three sixes and a boundary.\n\nBut rain had the final say as the game did not proceed further after four overs in the second innings.\n\nEarlier, Faf du Plessis top-scored in the match with 100 off just 58 balls to guide TSK to 203/5 in 20 overs. Saurabh Netravalkar was the pick among our bowlers with a tidy spell of 2/33 in four overs.\n\nPut into bat first, TSK got off to a good start reaching 67/0 at the end of the powerplay. Netravalkar broke the 109-run opening wicket partnership when he dismissed Devon Conway for 39, who was caught in the deep.\n\nAkeal Hosein struck in the next over to bring us back in the contest as we got two wickets in the space of five runs and TSK were 114/2 after 12 overs. But Faf du Plessis and Marcus Stoinis added a quickfire 62 off just 29 balls to take TSK past the 150-run mark.\n\nNetravalkar bowled an excellent penultimate over conceding just four runs including the wicket of centurion du Plessis as TSK finished at 203/5. Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen and Justin Dill chipped in with a wicket each.\n\nIn response, our skipper Steve Smith started from where he left off in the last match hitting three sixes and a four to give us a flying start. Travis Head too joined the party plundering 22 runs in the fourth over as we raced to 62/0 in just four overs.\n\nBut rain played spoilsport as the match had to be called off and both teams got a point each since the mandatory five overs were not completed for the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method to be used.\n\nWith that, we moved to the top of the MLC 2024 points table with three points from two matches.\n\nWe are up against the Seattle Orcas in the next match on Thursday at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.",
    "summary": "**Match Result:** The match between Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings was called off due to heavy rain, with both teams sharing the points.\n\n**First Innings:** Texas Super Kings scored 203/5 in 20 overs, with Faf du Plessis top-scoring with 100 off 58 balls. Saurabh Netravalkar was the pick of the Washington Freedom bowlers, taking 2/33 in four overs.\n\n**Second Innings:** Washington Freedom were 62/0 in four overs, with Steve Smith scoring 26 off 13 balls and Travis Head scoring 32 off 12 balls, when the match was called off due to rain.\n\n**Tournament Standings:** Washington Freedom moved to the top of the MLC 2024 points table with three points from two matches.\n\n**Next Match:** Washington Freedom will play their next match against the Seattle Orcas on Thursday at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.",

    "date": "Thu Jul  4 15:15:09 2024",
    "body": "This side of the Earth was just host to one of the most exciting World Cups in recent memory and now the eyes of the cricketing world will remain fixed on the US as Major League Cricket gets ready to fire up its second season.\n\nLast year, it was Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran, Rashid Khan, and MI New York that got to hoist the championship trophy in Texas. There's been a lot of player movement since last year and a lot of world-class cricketers will be playing in the league for the first time, but will anyone have the chops to dethrone MINY?\n\nMI New York\n\nThe New Yorkers didn't do a lot of tinkering with the roster that took home the title. With a batting lineup that includes Pollard, Pooran, Dewald Brevis, and Tim David and a bowling attack that features Rashid, Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and the US's best spin bowler in Nosh Kenjige, there simply wasn't a whole lot to do. The biggest absentee from last year's squad is David Wiese. While Wiese spent the last month helping anchor Namibia's World Cup team, his time spent with MINY in 2023 wasn't as memorable. If anything, New York's bowling -- which was already one of the scariest in the league -- will get a boost from South African speedster Anrich Nortje, who spent last year with Washington.\n\nWith a roster very similar to the one that won it all last year, MINY will be the team to beat this year.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nThe Orcas were the most consistent team in the league last year, taking a 5-1 record into the championship match. And, like MINY, they didn't do a lot of off-season roster movement. The team's core -- South Africans Heinrich Klaasan and Quinton de Kock, as well as Shayan Jayasuriya and Nauman Anwar (familiar names to fans of Minor League Cricket) -- remains intact.\n\nGone this year are Shimron Hetmyer and Andrew Tye. Seattle hopes to replace Hetmyer's bat -- though probably not his colorful hair -- with USA's Aaron Jones. Jones' 94 not out against Canada in the first match of the World Cup might be considered the spark that led the team to a berth in the Super Eights round. Making up Tye's lost overs will be South African Nandre Burger and West Indian Obed McCoy.\n\nLook for the Orcas to make another strong run at the MLC title again this year.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nThe Texas Super Kings wound up with the second-best record after the regular season, but back-to-back losses in the playoffs exposed the weaknesses that had haunted them throughout the campaign. Captain Faf du Plessis was abysmal as an opener and it seemed like they spent the early parts of every innings trying to claw back from a slow start.\n\nSo, what do you do? Well, if you're TSK, you clean house. Gone are the three of the team's top four run producers from last year -- Daniel Sams, David Miller, and Dwayne Bravo. And on the other side of the ball, gone are Gerald Coetzee and USA Cricket's Rusty Theron. That's a lot of runs and a lot of overs to make up.\n\nHoping to bring new life to the team and give TSK fans something to blow their whistles about are some big names: South African World Cup captain Aiden Markram, Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis, who played with San Francisco last year, and Afghanistan bowler Naveen ul-Haq. Another player to keep an eye on is 19-year-old Joshua Tromp, who lit up Minor League Cricket last year with the Houston Hurricanes.\n\nIf the new names come through, look for TSK to return to the playoffs. If they struggle, though, that's a lot of added pressure on captain Faf, Devon Conway, and domestic stars Milind Kumar and Calvin Savage.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nThe Freedom finished third in the league last year with a 3-2 record but were bounced in the first eliminator by the eventual champs, MINY. To make it back to the playoffs, Washington will have to deal with the departures of some big guns. Like TSK, they've seen the departure of three of their top four runs scorers from last year -- captain Moises Henriques, Matthew Short, and Glenn Phillips.\n\nThe team is in good shape, though, thanks to the addition of new captain, Australia's Steve Smith, New Zealand phenom Rachin Ravindra, and England's super solid Travis Head.\n\nThe Freedom's vicious bowling attack -- Marco Jansen, USA hero Saurabh Netravalkar, and West Indies spinner Akeal Hosein -- gets a boost from the addition of Lockie Ferguson. CricAmerica fave Dane Piedt won't be back with the team this year but look for some spin help from Amila Aponso and Akhilish Bodugum, who have both been impressive in minor league action.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nThe Unicorns started the 2023 campaign strongly. They left the Dallas portion of the schedule with a 2-1 record but were never able to get on track in Morrisville. They lost back-to-back matches at Church Street Park to see their playoff hopes dashed.\n\nThere are lots of new faces on the team in 2024. Captain Aaron Finch has been replaced by Australian all-around-good-guy Pat Cummins. While retaining their top run scorer in USA's Corey Anderson, the Unicorns will have a lot of runs -- and overs -- to make up with the departures of Matthew Wade and all-rounders Marcus Stoinis and Shadab Khan.\n\nHoping to fill that void are 22-year-old Aussie Jake Fraser-McGurk, who had a breakout Indian Premier League season for the Dehli Capitals, Matthew Short, who led the Washington Freedom in scoring last year, and Sherfane Rutherford, who just about single-handedly took down New Zealand in a vital West Indies World Cup win.\n\nThis could be an interesting year for San Francisco. Pat Cummins knows how to win; he captained Australia to titles in both the most recent World Test Championship as well as the 2023 Cricket World Cup. If he can get the Unicorns going in right direction, they could be a playoff contender.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nNo team had more flash and less success last year than the Knight Riders. With a batting lineup that included Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Rilee Rossouw, and Unmukt Chand and a bowling attack with two of the most creative spinners on the planet -- Sunil Narine and Adam Zampa -- as well as Lockie Ferguson and Ali Khan, they were beasts…on paper.\n\nIn reality, though, nothing clicked. They limped to a 1-4 record. And it wasn't even a pretty 1-4. They lost to TSK by 69 and got bowled out for 50 in a 105-run loss to MINY.\n\nThis year, they'll have to try it all again without Rossouw, who -- along with Russell -- was the only Knight Rider to crack 100 runs. Hoping to boost the offense is David Miller, who scored 143 for TSK last year and Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Also gone for 2024 is New Zealand quick Ferguson but LA hopes to make up the difference with Josh Little, who's had success in The Hundred and was the first Irish player to sign with the IPL.\n\nLAKR should be better than last year. Narine had a monster year for champions KKR in the IPL -- and West Indies fans can only wonder what would have happened if he was on the 2024 T20 World Cup team! If everyone else plays somewhat up to potential, the men in purple could make a run for the playoffs.\n\nThis season the Major League Cricket schedule is bumped up to seven matches for each team and games will -- once again -- be split between Grand Prairie Stadium outside of Dallas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. Matches will be broadcast over the Willow cable channel and app with various regional sports networks bringing the action to those who don't have Willow.",

Washington are on a good run of form in the MLC. Who will win this game of cricket?\n\nReceive Your Welcome Bonus!\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns form\n\nCorey Anderson and his men have taken their positive energy flowing from the humbling of Washington Freedom last night. The underdogs took down the top team in the table so this must have served as a big boost coming into this action. He believes in his team making an interesting fight banked on Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk to be an explosive opening pair. High expectations rest on Sanjay Krishnamurthi, who played a match-winning knock in the last game. Josh Inglis and Matthew Short are the other two middle-order batsmen. Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan will be important as they come in to add runs during the later moments. The bowling will be under scrutiny, with bowlers like Brody Couch and Hassan Khan expected to do the job. Liam Plunkett and Haris Rauf will be experienced enough to shine during the middle overs. While both Anderson and Tajinder Dhillon are expecting to play effective supporting roles.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Predicted Lineup\n\nCorey Anderson, Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short, Josh Inglis, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Hassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Tajinder Dhillon\n\nWashington Freedom form\n\nIn their most recent league match, the Washington Freedom took a dent as they lost the contest against the San Francisco Unicorns by a margin of 6 wickets. The loss was the first for Steven Smith's side in what was turning out to be a fine season till now. They have been fantastic in most of the matches and, primarily, the batsmen have put the opposition teams' bowling attacks under a lot of pressure. The Unicorns are a team that Steven Smith and his side would want to face in their second encounter to return to winning ways.\n\nThe consistency of Travis Head and Steven Smith at the top order has been quite crucial. This pair will, therefore, be relied upon to provide a solid start in the forthcoming match. Andries Gous has been solid at No. 3 and will look to stitch partnerships with Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell in the middle order. The lower middle order comprising Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, and Marco Jansen will be expected to contribute quick runs.\n\nThe bowling has been good as a unit throughout the season, and it would want Marco Jansen and Jasdeep Singh to provide it a good start. Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar have to bowl good tight spells in the middle overs. Also, Maxwell and Ravindra can support the team in bowling.\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted Lineup\n\nSteven Smith (c), Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, Andries Gous (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Saurabh Netravalkar, Lockie Ferguson, Jasdeep Singh\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns vs Washington Freedom Expert Tips & Prediction\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have a good record of batting but their attack of them in bowling is not that strong, so it's going to be hard for the bowlers against the hitters in the team of Washington Freedom. Washington Freedom has the best number of top orders with a good run in the form, adding to the balanced bowling attack, surely the game is going to be of favor in the pocket of them. So, Washington Freedom will bag the honours over here.",

His explosive performance included a standout moment with an innovative shot that featured prominently in the highlights of the New York innings, which concluded at 163/8 in their 20 overs.\n\nRashid Khan’s unique stroke play\n\nRashid is well-known for his ability to replicate MS Dhoni’s signature ‘helicopter’ shot, a swift aerial flick from near the off-stump to the on-side, often resulting in a six. However during the match, Rashid introduced a unique shot of himself.\n\nFacing a delivery from pacer Aaron Hardie, Rashid innovatively adjusted his approach. On the last ball of the 17th over, with a delivery marginally short and outside off-stump, Rashid sat deep in his crease and, with a powerful whip of his bat, sent the ball soaring over wide long-on for a spectacular six.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso READ: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024: Broadcast, live streaming details – When and Where to watch in India, US, UK, Australia & other countries\n\nMI New York’s challenging start\n\nNew York’s innings got off to a rocky start after being asked to bat first by TSK. They lost opener Dewald Brevis for a duck and Nicholas Pooran for 8, both wickets falling inside the first four overs, leaving the team at a precarious 18 for 2.\n\nShayan Jahangir and Monank Patel then steadied the innings with a 39-run partnership before Dwayne Bravo disrupted it by dismissing Jahangir for 26 off 23 balls. Rashid then joined Patel, and although the duo added a promising 35 runs, Patel was dismissed by spinner Noor Ahmad for a well-made 48 off 41 balls.\n\nRashid’s impactful innings\n\nDespite the interruptions, Rashid’s innings proved crucial. He counter-attacked with flair, hitting Bravo and Noor for boundaries, and scored two consecutive sixes off Hardie. His aggressive batting helped elevate the score to a competitive 163, though Romario Shepherd and New York’s captain, Kieron Pollard, contributed modestly. Rashid’s innings, characterized by 4 fours and 4 sixes, came at an impressive strike rate of 183.33. It marked the fourth time he has scored a fifty in T20 cricket.\n\nVictory for the Texas Super Kings\n\nIn the second innings, despite a brief rain delay complicating conditions, Rashid delivered a disciplined spell of bowling. He was introduced in the fourth over and conceded only four runs. Over his four-over spell, he maintained tight control, giving away just 22 runs.\n\nNevertheless, despite Rashid’s efforts, the Texas Kings chased down the target with ease. The leading run-scorer of the tournament, Faf du Plessis, continued his exceptional form, scoring another fifty and guiding TSK to a nine-wicket victory, thus winning the crucial Eliminator game.",

    "body": "The cricket system in the USA, similar to in different parts of the world, isn’t always without its flaws. Although it represents a vast emerging marketplace for the game, its early years were marred by controversies. Despite these challenges, one positive development has been the establishment of Major League Cricket (MLC), a premier T20 competition.\n\nMLC has created a platform for players from diverse countries and backgrounds to interact with some of the sport’s biggest names. This league provides an indirect pathway for Indian cricketers, who are unable to play outside of India, to showcase their talents if they relocate to the USA for various reasons.\n\nAs MLC 2024 approaches the qualifiers, three Indian-born players are particularly keen to make their mark. Let’s take a closer look at their stories:\n\n1. Milind Kumar – Texas Super Kings\n\nRight-handed batsman Milind Kumar was once quite a celebrity in Indian domestic cricket. He began his career in the Ranji Trophy with his hometown Delhi before moving to Sikkim for the 2018-19 season, where he emerged as the highest run-scorer with 1331 runs beating the top players as the faces of Wasim Jaffer and Rinku Singh .\n\nKumar had brief spells in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) and Royal Challengers Bangalore. However, limited opportunities led him to move to the USA around 2021, where he initially played in Minor League Cricket. His impressive performances there earned him a spot in the Texas Super Kings (TSK) for the inaugural MLC season. Kumar has since secured his place in the team, regularly batting at number five under the leadership of Faf du Plessis.\n\nThis season, Kumar contributed to TSK’s third-place finish in the league stage. His early matches included a couple of unbeaten innings, though he didn’t have much to bat in those games. He later scored two runs each in two consecutive matches before making a decent 29 (28) against the Seattle Orcas just before the playoffs.\n\n2. Monank Patel – MI New York\n\nMonank Patel is a well-known figure as the captain of the USA national team, which he led commendably during the recent 2024 T20 World Cup, including scoring a half-century against Pakistan. Born in Anand, Gujarat, Patel moved to the USA permanently in 2016 to open a restaurant in New Jersey, having earned his green card in 2010.\n\nAlthough Patel played only age-group cricket in Gujarat, his cricketing development primarily occurred in the USA, leading to his international debut in 2018. As a keeper-batsman, he has struggled to replicate his international form in MLC.\n\nLast season, he managed just 63 runs, and in the current edition, apart from a notable 61-run inning against TSK in a losing effort, he has not surpassed eight runs in six other games. However, his potential to shine in critical matches might still come through as MLC progresses.\n\n3. Saurabh Netravalkar – Washington Freedom\n\nThe journey of Saurabh Netravalkar is one of the most famous stories in Indian cricket teams. Born in Mumbai in 1991, the leading wicket-taker in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup is a promising left-arm spinner. Netrawalkar moved to the US. in 2015 to pursue a career in software engineering but continued his passion for cricket, which ultimately led to his international debut for the US\n\nIn MLC 2024, Netra Valkar has confirmed her growing popularity. Despite missing two matches due to the birth of a child, he picked up 12 wickets in five games, making him the top wicket-taker in the tournament and his performances, especially in the powerplay, have been significant in the Washington Freedom victory, helping them gain the top spot in the league table.\n\nAlthough he went wicketless against the San Francisco Unicorns in a recent match, he is expected to bounce back strongly in the upcoming qualifier against the same team. These three players highlight the opportunities MLC provides for cricketers with diverse backgrounds and journeys, fostering a unique cricketing ecosystem in the USA.",

The duo have scored a total of 497 runs out of our total 936 runs this season, a whopping 53%, at a fast clip as well. Another flying start on Thursday and we will have one leg in the final.\n\nTye, playing his first game of the season, picked up three wickets against SFU in our last match. Though Tye was a bit expensive, he dismissed big-hitters Jake Fraser-McGurk, Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford, the last two in the same over, to keep us in the game right through the defense.\n\nMeanwhile, Netravalkar will be our trump card once again with his best spell in the MLC coming against the same opponent last year. His astonishing figures of 6/9 against SFU in 2023 helped us win a low-scoring game by a comfortable 30-run margin.\n\nWashington Freedom squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs SFU Qualifier MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nLIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns match will be available on Monumental Sports Network and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA.

I have two T20 tournaments ahead of me--an MLC (Major League Cricket) organized by USA and the next is Canada's Global T20. I will play those two tournaments and see how it is going. After that, there is a Test series against Pakistan and I will play that series. That's the plan for now,\" Shakib said here today as he was leaving the country for USA to play MLC.\n\nShakib had below par T20 World Cup campaign this year, which encouraged his critics to lash out at him vehemently. They raised their voice high about his immediate retirement, citing the reason that at the age of 37, it would be tough for the allrounder to regain his form.\n\nEarlier, Shakib revealed that he would retire from the cricket after the Champions Trophy in 2025 but recently in an interview with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) he revealed that he wants to play another ODI World Cup which is in 2027.\n\nBut it looked he changed his plan again.\n\n\"I didn't really plan too much. I need to understand my physical condition. At this moment it is not possible for me to plan for the next three or four years. I think it's better to plan for three or six months. For the time being, my plan is for Pakistan series, then I will see what next for me,\" Shakib added.\n\nBangladesh won three matches of the group phase in T20 World Cup and moved up to the Supe 8 for only the second time in tournament's history. However they lost all three matches in Super 8 phase and even though they had the golden chance to make it semifinal, Bangladesh's safe cricket sank them at the end.\n\n\"May be we didn't play all out cricket. We didn't get the kind of results we expected or the kind of results we had a chance of getting. We fulfilled the initial (Super Eight) target, so it is successful from that point of view. It's a bit disappointing for us because we couldn't go to the semifinal.\"\n\nIn response to a query why they couldn't make it possible to make it semis, Shakib said, 'It is difficult to say. In fact, I am sure those who are there will decide that why we can't make it. The coach, captain, team and others who are in the cricket operations, board and others will discuss together to sort it out.\"",

Bangladesh are scheduled to play two Tests and three T20Is against India from September 19 to October 12 following their tour of Pakistan in August, where they are slated to play a two-match Test series.\n\nThe legendary all-rounder departed from Dhaka to the USA on Monday, July 1, to take part in the second edition of MLC. He will be plying his trade for Los Angeles Knight Riders, who finished last in the inaugural season last year. Shakib informed that he isn't thinking too far ahead, having only planned till the tour of Pakistan next month.\n\n“I don't have many plans. There are two T20 tournaments in front of me one is MLC and the other one is the Global T20 League in Canada and let me see where I stand after playing these two tournaments because I need to understand [how I feel],” Shakib was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.\n\n“There is international cricket and there is a series against Pakistan, and I am planning till that point of time and not planning beyond that. Now I don't have time to plan for three-four years and so planning for three to six months is better and later will think about my next plan and so till now I am planning till the Pakistan series,” the experienced cricketer added.\n\nAlso Read: Warner, Babar, Narine, Shakib among galaxy of stars to light up GT20 Canada 2024\n\nTaskin Ahmed apologized for missing the team bus: Shakib\n\nTaskin Ahmed was surprisingly left out of the playing XI in Bangladesh's crucial Super Eights fixture in the recently concluded T20 World Cup 2024 against eventual champions India in Antigua. A Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official had recently revealed that the pacer woke up late in the morning and missed the team bus. Shakib also spoke along those lines and said that the 29-year-old apologized for his negligence.\n\n“The team bus starts at a certain point and there is a rule for cricketers that team bus does not stop for anyone and if anyone misses it in that case he comes in the next car. The manager's car or a taxi is there and the support of transport was difficult in the West Indies. When Taskin arrived it was five to 10 minutes before the toss, and certainly it was difficult to pick him at that point in the team and it was difficult for him as well,” Shakib said.\n\nAlso Read: T20 World Cup 2024: Taskin Ahmed apologises for missing team bus after waking up late for India game\n\n“Taskin apologized to the team for that afterwards and everyone in the team took it normally because a man can mistake and anyone can commit unintentional mistake, and he accepted it and the thing ended at that point of time,” the cricketer said.",

The 2024 season starts July 5, with the Championship Final taking place at Grand Prairie Stadium on July 28. Here’s your guide to the upcoming exciting season of the MLC in the USA.\n\nHow many teams are going to participate?\n\nJust like the inaugural season, the second season of the MLC will see all the six founding teams clashing against each other with the Seattle Orcas, MI New York, LA Knight Riders, Washington Freedom, San Francisco Unicorns and Texas Super Kings battling it out\n\nWhere is it going to be played?\n\nAfter the success that was the first season, the league will be played across the two venues which also hosted the matches last year - Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nHas the format changed?\n\nYes. The league's first season was played in a single round robin format with 15 league stages matches. However, the second season will see an increase to 21 league games, with each of the teams playing seven games instead of five last season. The tournament will then move to the playoff stages, which will follow the same format as the first season with a Qualifier, Challenger and Eliminator to be played before the summit clash.\n\nMLC has been given List A status. What does that mean?\n\nEarlier this year, the ICC awarded the MLC with List A status, making it only the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire the status from the game’s governing body. This basically means all the records, runs, wickets and stats acquired in the MLC will now be added to the official records of the format. It also means that MLC is now an official T20 League, much like the IPL or the SA20 or Big Bash League.\n\nHow long are the games?\n\nThe T20 format is a shortened version of cricket that lasts approx 3- 3 ½ hours.\n\nWhere can we watch MLC?\n\nTo cheer on your Seattle Orcas in person, all matches will be broadcast at all 5 locations at Flat Stick Pub (https://flatstickpub.com/locations/). For more info check out our watch party events on Facebook.\n\nKirkland\n\nRedmond\n\nPioneer Square\n\nSouth Lake Union\n\nBellingham\n\nSpokane\n\nThe broadcasters vary, so check your local listings to see if these are included in your channel package:",

It's going to be just like baseball... if baseball was interesting for more than 5 minutes at a time!\n\nNow, here's a googly you'll want to play: the Sulekha coupon! Think of it as your secret weapon, your ticket to cricket nirvana. By using the code 'SULEKHA2024', you're not just getting a 20% discount, you're practically stealing runs from the ticketing system! It's like hitting a six when you only needed a single - overachieving at its finest!\n\nBut wait, there's more! This isn't just any old coupon. Oh no, the 'SULEKHA2024' code is your VIP pass to the cricketing event of the year. It's like having Sachin Tendulkar as your personal batting coach, or Shane Warne teaching you to spin - it's that good! So don't let this googly of an opportunity slip through to the keeper.\n\nRemember, in cricket and in life, you miss 100% of the shots you don't play. And with the Sulekha coupon in your arsenal, you're already ahead of the game. It's time to pad up, step onto the pitch, and be part of American cricket history.\n\nHowzat for a summer plan? Now, off you go! May your tickets be cheap, your seats be prime, and may the odds be ever in your favor (wrong franchise, but you get the idea). See you at the cricket!",

    "date": "Wed Jul 10 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "For Major League Cricket organizers, the timing couldn’t be better.\n\nOn the heels of a T20 men’s cricket World Cup in which the American co-hosts scored a signature victory over Pakistan in the group stage, the domestic cricket league sees momentum for greater growth.\n\nMLC opens its second season July 5, six days after the World Cup final won by India. Organizers hope the United States’ success helps push the sport, and ultimately the league, more deeply into America’s sports consciousness.\n\n“Cricket has tried and failed in this country for probably 25, 30 years,” MLC director Justin Geale said. “This is the furthest anyone’s got, so we’ve got to keep that momentum going.”\n\nCricket’s global popularity may come as a shock to some American sports fans.\n\nIt is the most popular sport in India, the world’s most populous country, and enjoys similar appeal in parts of the Caribbean and countries such as England, South Africa and Australia. The Indian Premier League, the country’s top domestic T20 circuit, has grown into one of the world’s most lucrative leagues; and the sport, which is the second-most-watched in the world, will return to the Olympics in 2028 following a 128-year hiatus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious attempts to find a place for cricket in the American sports landscape haven’t worked out.\n\nShort-lived Pro Cricket operated an eight-team league in 2004. It aimed to capitalize on the advent of professional T20 cricket in the United Kingdom but folded after one season. (T20, or Twenty20, is a faster, shortened version of the sport.) The American Premier League, another T20 competition, failed to launch in 2009, though it finally got off the ground in 2021.\n\nMajor League Cricket debuted in July 2023. The league features six teams: from New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and Grand Prairie, Tex. (near Dallas), competing in the T20 format. Bolstered by $120 million in investment, those teams include some of the top players in the world who are able to play during their offseasons. Games have been contested only in Texas and North Carolina, but organizers say most of the funding will be used for building or upgrading eight venues across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir goal is to grow the sport in America, ideally beyond the South Asian diaspora. They said they don’t want to compete for sports supremacy with the NFL or the NBA. MLC aims to capitalize on burgeoning interest in cricket so the league can eventually become a more casual presence in American sports fans’ lives — and benefit from the more lucrative broadcast deals that expansive popularity invites.\n\nA promising first season outperformed the league’s expectations, with games selling out at the venue (capacity: 3,500) in Morrisville, N.C., outside Raleigh, and those in the stadium in Grand Prairie (capacity: 7,200) averaging more than 80 percent capacity. Saurabh Netravalkar, a breakout star at the World Cup, and other players said they were pleasantly surprised by the professionalism and quality of competition.\n\n“We learned an awful lot,” Geale said. “What’s most pleasing is it actually worked. You spend three years trying to plan and you theorize, but people actually came, so our crowds were really positive — and we didn’t help ourselves. We’re playing in Texas in the middle of summer.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe league’s priority now is building venues in other cities to connect with fans in those areas. It is a critical but ongoing challenge that could have teams relying on temporary facilities such as the one used in New York for the World Cup as they work to secure more permanent grounds.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas are developing a stadium east of the city in Redmond, Wash., and the San Francisco Unicorns are planning a Santa Clara venue the team hopes will become part of a larger sports and entertainment hub. The Washington Freedom was in negotiations with George Mason University to build a temporary baseball and cricket stadium on the Northern Virginia school’s west campus, but plans fell through in March after students and local residents opposed the project, and the university president later said it “does not meet the strategic objectives and interests of our campus and community and the Washington Freedom.” Franchises in New York and Los Angeles also are seeking stadiums.\n\nThat’s why teams play in North Carolina and Texas, though the league has mandated each team secure a home ground by 2028, when Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our biggest challenge is infrastructure. If we had more places to play, we’d go and play, so that’s holding back our growth,” Geale said. “We’re looking to build stadiums as quick as we can in all these areas. As soon as we can do that, I think we can grow quicker, the season can get longer; we can really talk to local fans and build a brand around, say, the Washington Freedom, rather than trying to do that over a distance.”\n\nFor players, that can mean little to no connection to their “home” city for the time being.\n\nLast season, Freedom players attended a preseason camp in the Dallas area a few weeks before the start of the season in July. The first half of their schedule was in Texas, the second half in North Carolina, then back to Dallas for the playoffs. Netravalkar plays for the Freedom while working as a software engineer for Oracle in the Bay Area. He said last year he only ventured east for MLC events in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhead of Year 2, some things will change.\n\nMLC games were broadcast in more than 80 countries last year and were shown via Sling TV and Willow TV, which streams overseas cricket events. Select games aired on CBS Sports Network. To expand coverage in 2024, MLC is negotiating partnerships with regional sports networks in its six cities. There will be six more matches on the schedule, up from 19. Teams such as the Freedom are considering how to engage their local fans from a distance — through clinics, meet-and-greets or contests where winners are flown out to watch games in person.\n\nDespite its stadium struggles, MLC is poised for expansion. Geale said it could add two teams by 2026 and is eyeing franchises in Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto, New Jersey and South Florida.\n\nMLC has a developmental minor league through which it is helping cultivate young domestic talent. Over time, the idea is for pro teams and their players to be more involved in their communities through coaching, mentorship and other forms of outreach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there is the development of the U.S. men’s and women’s national teams.\n\nThe men’s upset over 2022 T20 World Cup runner-up Pakistan last month helped them qualify for the tournament’s second round, called the Super Eight, where the team’s dream run ended. Still, its advancement means it automatically qualifies for the 2026 edition of the tournament hosted by India and Sri Lanka. Geale believes the success drives more attention to the sport and opens the door for the league to negotiate better broadcast opportunities.\n\nNetravalkar, a bowler for the U.S. national team, said MLC already has contributed to that effort.\n\n“I think Major League the first season really helped us because that gave us the platform to play on quality pitches within the U.S. and to sort of rub shoulders with some of the top cricketers across the globe in front of good crowds,” he said.\n\n“It’s really heartening to see that cricket has arrived,” he added. “We planted a seed for growth, and Major League being immediately after the World Cup helps a lot to continue that trajectory and make it even bigger.”",
    "summary": "**Timing and Momentum**: The MLC's second season is set to start on July 5, just six days after the T20 men's cricket World Cup final, which could help capitalize on the momentum of the US team's recent success.\n\n**Background**: Cricket is the second-most-watched sport in the world, but previous attempts to establish a professional league in the US have failed. MLC debuted in July 2023 with six teams competing in the T20 format, featuring top players from around the world.\n\n**Season 1**: The first season of MLC outperformed expectations, with sold-out games in Morrisville, NC, and high attendance in Grand Prairie, TX. The league received positive feedback from players and fans alike.\n\n**Challenges and Goals**: The league's biggest challenge is building infrastructure, including permanent venues in each city. The goal is to create a more casual presence in American sports fans' lives and eventually secure more lucrative broadcast deals.\n\n**Expansion and Growth**: MLC is planning to expand to new cities, including Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto, New Jersey, and South Florida, with the aim of adding two new teams by 2026. The league is also developing a minor league to cultivate young domestic talent and plans to increase community outreach and engagement.\n\n**Broadcast and Partnerships**: MLC games will be broadcast in more than 80 countries, and the league is negotiating partnerships with regional sports networks in its six cities. Select games will air on CBS Sports Network.\n\n**US National Teams**: The success of the US men's national team, including their upset win over Pakistan, has helped drive more attention to the sport. MLC's director believes this will open up better broadcast opportunities for the league.",

    "body": "Perhaps the greatest six-hitter in T20s, West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell has proved his ability once again, with a stunning 107m six. Playing for Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) in USA's Major League Cricket (MLC), Russell hammered Pakistan's Haris Rauf for a towering 107m six in the final over of their innings. Russell's six and 15 runs off the 20th over helped LAKR to a total of 165/6 against the San Francisco Unicorns, which they were unable to defend.\n\nThe video of the six went viral on social media, posted by the official account of Major League Cricket.\n\nWatch: Andre Russell's gigantic 107m six\n\nIn the third ball of the final over, the mighty Jamaican power-hitter heaved a pitched-up ball by Haris Rauf into the stands over the mid-wicket region, making it the longest six of MLC season two. Russell contributed an unbeaten 25-ball 40 to help LAKR to a fighting score.\n\nHowever, LAKR's total would not be enough, as the San Francisco Unicorns made mincemeat of the target and chased it down in just 15.2 overs.\n\nLAKR now stand on one win and two defeats after three games, having finished the previous season at the bottom of the table.\n\nAndre Russell has been in good form in 2024. Russell contributed heavily with both bat and ball as Kolkata Knight Riders won IPL 2024. He scored 222 runs and picked up 19 wickets, finishing as the joint fourth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament.\n\nHis turnout wasn't as great in the 2024 T20 World Cup on home soil, as West Indies crashed out in the Super 8 stage after winning all of their group games.\n\nHowever, Russell has put his T20 World Cup disappointment behind him, and reunited with Kolkata Knight Riders teammate Sunil Narine, who's captaining LAKR in MLC. LAKR's next match is against the San Francisco Unicorns again, on Sunday, July 14.",

    "date": "Wed Jul 10 10:03:16 2024",
    "body": "Now the Major League Cricket in the United States is in full swing. The Seattle Orcas, have registered their first win of the competition. Following the disappointment of the first game, when the team from Washington state went down tamely to MI New York, the Orcas, led by South Africa international Heinrich Klaasen came back strong to down the La Knight Riders by nine Wickets.\n\nIt was a measured performance by the Seattle Orcas. Having restricted the powerful La Knight Riders batting lineup to 168 for 5 in their 20 overs, the Orcas didn’t seem it necessary to rush their response. Having lost opener Nauman Anwar early, the team settled down to pace the innings, and to get to the target with as few risks as possible. Which is what they did.\n\nSeattle Orcas Restrict the La Knight Riders\n\nDespite losing their last game against the San Francisco Unicorns, the La Knight Riders are a force to be reckoned with. With top-class batters like David Miller, and Andre Russell in the lineup. And the Knight Riders got off to a decent start, posting 67 in 9.3 overs at the fall of the 2nd wicket. However, that is when the Seattle Orcas’ bowling attack put the screws on the La middle order.\n\nWith Cameron Gannon, Zaman Khan, and Imad Wasim locking down the opposition batsman and knocking a few off as well. Jason Roy was the top scorer for the La Knight Riders with 69 off 52 deliveries. With late impetus provided by David Miller who smashed 44 off 22 inclusive of two sixes. The trouble was this was not enough, especially given the batting of the opposition.\n\nOrcas Chase – The Ryan Rickelton Show\n\n169 was one of those scores in T20 cricket. A score that is not too imposing but not an easy one either. And a lot depends on how the top order of the chasing side pace themselves in going about it. For the Seattle Orcas, that man happened to be Ryan Rickelton. The 27-year-old South African native played a superb 103 off 66 inclusive of five sixes.\n\nThis meant that other players, Quinton de Kock to be exact, just had to hang around and provide support whilst Rickelton blasted the Knight Riders bowling to all corners. However, as the game neared its end, things became a bit tricky, as the Orcas got to the score with just one ball to spare. But a win is a win. However going forward, they would not like to cut it that fine. With the power-hitting that is at their disposal, finishing games off sooner rather than later should be the way forward for the Orcas.\n\nMajor League Cricket Table – No Clear Leaders At the Moment\n\nWhilst it is still early days for the season and the league as a whole-things are already shaping up pretty nicely, as the six major franchises battle it out for the top spot. With five of the six teams registering a win, with no result leaves the Texas Super Kings with no points. For cricket fans in America and elsewhere, if there were questions surrounding the quality of players and competitiveness of the cricket being played, games like this should put those doubts to rest.",
    "summary": "**Match Result:** Seattle Orcas won their first match of the tournament, defeating La Knight Riders by 9 wickets.\n\n**Key Performances:**\n\n* Ryan Rickelton of Seattle Orcas scored 103 off 66 balls, including 5 sixes, to lead his team's chase.\n* Jason Roy of La Knight Riders top-scored with 69 off 52 balls.\n* David Miller of La Knight Riders scored 44 off 22 balls, including 2 sixes.\n\n**Tournament Standings:** The league table is currently tight, with five out of six teams having registered a win. The Texas Super Kings are the only team without a point.\n\n**Notable Mentions:**\n\n* Seattle Orcas restricted La Knight Riders to 168/5 in their 20 overs, thanks to a strong bowling performance by Cameron Gannon, Zaman Khan, and Imad Wasim.\n* The La Knight Riders' top-class batting lineup, including David Miller and Andre Russell, was unable to overcome the Orcas' bowling attack.",

    "body": "Texas Super Kings (TSK) fast bowler Gerald Coetzee has been ruled out of Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 due to a low-grade left side strain. He suffered the injury during TSK's first game of the season against Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), where he finished with figures of 1/28. A replacement is yet to be named for the 23-year-old, but veteran all-rounder Dwayne Bravo replaced him in the XI for the upcoming game against Washington Freedom.\n\nCoetzee was part of South Africa's T20 World Cup 2024 squad, but he did not play a game despite playing a couple of games in the T20 International (T20I) series against the West Indies prior to the tournament. The Proteas finished runners-up at the marquee event, losing to India by seven runs in the final in Barbados.\n\nSouth Africa will hope that their fast bowler recovers in time for the tour of the West Indies. He was recently named in the 16-member Test squad. The first Test of the series will begin on August 7 in Trinidad, while the second match will be played in Guyana from August 15.\n\nCoetzee has played three Tests since making his debut last year. He has picked up 10 wickets at 24.50 in the format so far.",

Faf was not as aggressive as he was on the way to his century in the previous game against Washington Freedom but played second fiddle to his New Zealand partner's power-hitting.\n\nEventually scoring 34 off 17, du Plessis gave away a simple catch, but by then more than half of the total was chased down. Conway took a blow to his fingers and was forced to retire hurt after scoring 32 off 19, but Aaron Hardie took the game on his shoulders thereafter. His 34 off 23 balls effectively helped his team reach the target despite Hassan Khan's efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns found themselves in a bind on what was a slightly slow pitch. Their powerplay was strong, having scored 74 runs, but they also lost three wickets, losing their momentum because of this.\n\nAfter Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk were sent back to the pavilion courtesy of some brilliant bowling by Zia Ul-Haq, Matt Short continued the ante with a fighting 33. His wicket in the 6th over was a big blow, as the rest of the batting lineup faltered under the disciplined bowling of the Super Kings.\n\nMohammad Mohsin was the standout performer with the ball for the Super Kings, delivering a stellar spell that yielded figures of 4/13. His consistent line and length, coupled with his ability to extract some purchase from the pitch, made life difficult for the Unicorns' batters.\n\nBrief Scores: Texas Super Kings beat San Francisco Unicorns .",

Their decision proved fruitful as they managed to restrict the Unicorns to a modest 127 in 17.5 overs. The standout performer with the ball was Mohammad Mohsin, who claimed four wickets for just 13 runs in 3.5 overs, effectively dismantling the Unicorns' batting lineup.\n\nDwayne Bravo provided crucial support, taking 2 for 20, and ensuring the Unicorns' middle and lower order never settled. Matthew Short was the only bright spot for the Unicorns, scoring a quickfire 33 off 15 balls.\n\nIn response, the Super Kings' chase was clinical. Openers Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway set a blistering pace with a 61-run partnership in just 4.5 overs. Du Plessis, who scored 34 off 17 balls, and Conway, with 32 off 19, laid the foundation for a swift chase.\n\nAaron Hardie further stabilized the innings, contributing 34 off 23 balls, guiding the Super Kings to their target in just 12.5 overs with seven wickets in hand.\n\nThis victory not only lifted the Super Kings from the bottom of the standings but also showcased their potential to dominate the league. With this win, they now lead the points table, while the Unicorns, with two points from two games, find themselves in fifth place in the six-team competition. The win has certainly set the tone for what promises to be an exciting season ahead in the Major League Cricket 2024.",

    "body": "Right then, that is it from this exciting encounter between the Los Angeles Knight Riders and Seattle Orcas. However, the action doesn’t stop here and we will be back with more games from Major League Cricket 2024. The next game will be played between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings at Morrisville on 11th July, Thursday. The first ball will be bowled at 12.30 am IST (7.00 pm GMT the previous day) but our coverage will start much earlier. Until then, goodbye and cheers!\n\nRyan Rickelton is the Player of the Match for his scintillating knock of 103 runs in 66 deliveries. He says that he is just happy to be out there and contribute to the team. Adds that he was panicking when he got close to the ton and Quinton de Kock wasn't helping as well. Says that it is always fun to play with him and he is a phenomenal player. Mentions that the wicket was a bit sticky early on but it got better and that is why they chased. Further adds that it was a shocking run with which he completed the hundred, and they decided before that whatever happens, they would run and luckily Narine missed.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, the captain of Seattle Orcas says that they executed the plan perfectly and credits Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton for their partnership. Mentions that they had to work on their mistakes in the previous game. Says that they have a quality group of local players and the experience of overseas players which makes his task a bit easier. Mentions that he was a bit nervous in the last over but he had faith in his batters.\n\nSunil Narine, the skipper of Los Angeles Knight Riders says that they had a decent start but they couldn't take wickets at regular intervals. Feels that they played a good game and mentions that another 15-20 runs on the board would help them. Says that the conditions are better for the team batting second and that has been the norm on this side of the world. Ends by saying they will adapt and bounce back strongly.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw that after a good start by the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the initial phases, they fell behind the eight-ball in the middle overs. A few good overs by the Orcas put them under pressure and that resulted in a few wickets as well. However, the show that David Miller put up in the last few overs helped the Knight Riders end their innings at 168 runs.\n\nWayne Parnell from the Seattle Orcas is up for a chat. He says that they bounced back very well after losing the first game. Adds that they bowled nicely and there were some good pieces of fielding as well, and then the brilliant partnership between Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton. Says that he has been unwell but is recovering well. Mentions that the communication between the two batters was important. Ends by saying that the bucket hat is a part of trying to grow cricket in the US.\n\nSpencer Johnson gave a strong start to the Los Angeles Knight Riders as he sent back Nauman Anwar early on in the innings. After that, things went downhill for them as they failed to get any breakthrough and allowed a big partnership to be formed. They managed to keep things quiet for a while but after 10 overs they had to face the onslaught of the batters. They made some errors in the field as well which might be discussed in the team meetings later on. They took the game till the last over but Ali Khan didn’t have much left to defend. They fought hard but fell short of the win.\n\nSeattle Orcas had a shaky start with the early dismissal of Nauman Anwar. However, a strong partnership between the South African pair of Ryan Rickelton and Quinton de Kock released the pressure. Ryan Rickelton took the aggressive approach initially while de Kock took his time to get used to the conditions and then unleashed his array of shots. They dominated after the halfway mark of the innings and attacked every bowler. The constant rotation of strike too kept the pressure on the opponents and allowed them to bat freely. Ryan Rickelton got to his maiden T20 century while Quinton de Kock scored a half-century to finish things in their favor.\n\nIt was another last-over finish in the Major League Cricket but the Seattle Orcas have taken home those two points. Thanks to the 152-run stand between Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton, they have managed to do it in style and earned themselves their first win of the season.\n\n0\n\nOvers19.3\n\nScore167 - 1\n\nAli Khan to Quinton de Kock, Overpitched and on off, Quinton de Kock drives it a bit too well as the ball zips to mid off, Ryan Rickelton wants the run but is sent back. 2 runs needed in 3 balls now!\n\n6\n\nOvers18.3\n\nScore164 - 1\n\nAndre Russell to Quinton de Kock, SIX! FIFTY FOR QDK! He says it's his turn now! Fuller and on middle, in the slot, Quinton de Kock clears his front leg away and tonks it over the bowler's head for a biggie.\n\n1\n\nOvers18.2\n\nScore158 - 1\n\nAndre Russell to Ryan Rickelton, HUNDRED FOR RICKELTON! What a feat for the young South African! A maiden T20 ton and he has waited for this for a long time after getting out in the 90s on a few occasions. This is full and around off, Ryan Rickelton drives it straight to extra covers and sets off for the run, Sunil Narine picks up and has a shy at the bowler's end but misses with Rickelton putting in a dive.\n\n1\n\nOvers17.6\n\nScore155 - 1\n\nSpencer Johnson to Quinton de Kock, Short of a length and around middle, Quinton de Kock goes for the pull but does not get the power as the ball goes wide of deep square leg for one more. Seattle Orcas need 14 runs to win in the last two overs!\n\n0\n\nOvers16.6\n\nScore147 - 1\n\nSunil Narine to Quinton de Kock, Flatter, short and on leg, Quinton de Kock backs away to cut but gets a bottom edge onto the ground as the ball bounces over the keeper and goes nowhere. Just one run off the over!\n\nStrategic Break! The Seattle Orcas are inches away from a victory courtesy of this partnership between Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton. Both these batters have shown intent and batted sensibly keeping the pressure on the opponents. Los Angeles Knight Riders, on the other hand, will need a few quick wickets to get back in the game. Their morale seems to have dropped as seen by their fielding in the last couple of overs. With less than run a ball required to win, Seattle Orcas should look to keep the aggressive approach and improve their NRR.\n\n4\n\nOvers15.4\n\nScore145 - 1\n\nCorne Dry to Ryan Rickelton, FOUR! Oh..no! Another midfield and it costs LAKR again! This is slower, on a length and around off, Ryan Rickelton punches it with good timing wide of deep point, Shakib Al Hasan runs to his left and dives but the ball just bounces before him and he only manages to parry it to the fence for another boundary.\n\n4\n\nOvers14.1\n\nScore126 - 1\n\nSpencer Johnson to Quinton de Kock, FOUR! This is aggressive batting at its best! Spencer Johnson serves this on a length and around off. Quinton de Kock moves towards it and pulls it over short fine leg. The ball bounces once before crossing the ropes for four runs to begin the over.\n\n1\n\nOvers13.6\n\nScore122 - 1\n\nAli Khan to Quinton de Kock, Ali Khan serves it short and outside off. Quinton de Kock reads the slower one and he slaps it to long off for a single. A good over for the Seattle Orcas.",

That will bring the pacers into play, and already this venue is known for assisting bowling sides. The par score at this venue is 162-167, and the team that wins the toss, should bat first.\n\nSF vs TEX: Predicted XIs:\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Finn Allen, Josh Inglis (wk), Matthew Short, Corey Anderson (c), Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Brody Couch, Hassan Khan, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed\n\nTexas Super Kings: Devon Conway (wk), Faf du Plessis (c), Aaron Hardie, Joshua Tromp, Marcus Stoinis, Milind Kumar, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, Mohammad Mohsin, Naveen-ul-Haq, Zia-ul-Haq\n\nSuggested Dream11 Fantasy Team No. 1 SF vs TEX Dream11:\n\nWicket-keepers: Devon Conway, Josh Inglis\n\nBatters: Finn Allen, Jake Fraser, Faf du Plessis\n\nAll-rounders: Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Short, Aaron Hardie, Corey Anderson\n\nBowlers: Naveel ul Haq, Zia-ul-Haq\n\nCaptain First-Choice: Faf du Plessis || Captain Second-Choice: Josh Inglis\n\nVice-captain First-Choice: Marcus Stoinis || Vice-captain Second-Choice: Devon Conway\n\nSuggested Dream11 Fantasy Team No. 2 SF vs TEX Dream11:\n\nWicket-keeper: Devon Conway\n\nBatters: Finn Allen, Jake Fraser, Faf du Plessis\n\nAll-rounders: Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Short, Aaron Hardie\n\nBowlers: Naveel ul Haq, Pat Cummins, Haris Rauf, B Couch\n\nCaptain First-Choice: Matthew Short || Captain Second-Choice: Jake Fraser\n\nVice-captain First-Choice: Aaron Hardie || Vice-captain Second-Choice: Faf du Plessis\n\nSF vs TEX: Dream11 Prediction – Who Will Win?\n\nTexas Super Kings had a great chance to win the last game they played at this venue, but unfortunately, it got washed out due to rain.

Klaasen will be the key player in this game. Who will win this game of cricket?\n\nReceive Your Welcome Bonus!\n\nSeattle Orcas form\n\nThe Orcas lost the first game of the season and will be looking for a turnaround. They have multiple players who can change their fortunes and bounce back from that defeat. From the 2023 season, the team continues to benefit from Cameron Gannon's expertise; the pace bowler captured 11 wickets last season, earning him the title of the tournament's top domestic player. Heinrich Klaasen finished the 2023 MLC season as the runner-up in total runs scored, trailing only his South African teammate, Quinton de Kock, having amassed 235 runs for the Seattle Orcas. Quinton de Kock has been instrumental in all parts of the world with his white-ball form.\n\nSeattle Orcas Predicted Lineup\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Nauman Anwar, Aaron Jones, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Wasim, Michael Bracewell, Harmeet Singh, Cameron Gannon, Nandre Burger, Zaman Khan\n\nWashington Freedom form\n\nThe Washington Freedoms have started the season strong with one victory and one match abandoned due to unforeseen circumstances. They have been good but they need to keep the consistency going. They will be looking to make it into the playoffs after doing good in the initial games. Saurabh Netravalkar will play a crucial role in getting early wickets. He has been phenomenal in the recently concluded World Cup and would hope to keep the momentum going.\n\nBefore moving to the United States, Justin Dill was a prominent cricketer in South Africa. Known for his fast bowling and the capacity to swing the ball, Dill has proven himself on the international stage. He secured eight wickets in eight T20 games prior to his relocation.\n\nSteve Smith will again be a key batsman in this format of the game.\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted Lineup\n\nMukhtar Ahmed, Steven Smith, Justin Dill, Obus Pienaar, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Lockie Ferguson, Andries Gous, Saurabh Netravalkar, Marco Jansen, Akeal Hosein\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom Expert Tips & Prediction\n\nThe upcoming match is scheduled for an evening start at Grand Prairie Stadium. The team will be looking to bowl first as we have seen in many night games.\n\nExpect warm and humid conditions, with temperatures likely to rise as the night progresses, and no rain anticipated. A good game of T20 is on the cards. We have seen a lot of low scores on this pitch and we see no difference in this game.\n\nBoth teams in this game have limited history with each other, a common scenario among many Major League Cricket teams. The outcome could hinge on standout performances from key players. Washington Freedom, riding on a wave of recent good form, might have a slight advantage over the Seattle Orcas in this encounter, making them a potentially safer choice.",

The former Netherlands all-rounder recently worked with Gambhir at the Kolkata Knight Riders, serving as the team's fielding coach in the championship-winning campaign.\n\nTen Doeschate is also part of the supporting staff of KKR's subsidiaries in the Caribbean Premier League, Major League Cricket and ILT20. Gambhir has already advocated for Abhishek Nayar and the former India all-rounder is almost certain to join the Indian team as an assistant coach, a role similar to the one he wants ten Doeschate for.\n\nIn a video shot at a KKR function during the IPL 2024, Gambhir said: \"When I talk about selflessness, I have never said this in 42 years of my career. And I wanted to say this. The greatest team man I ever played with, the most selfless human being, someone I can take a bullet for, someone who I can trust for life.\n\n\"I can tell you this because in 2011, my first game as a KKR captain, we only had four overseas (players) available. And this man had a fabulous 50-over World Cup. And we went in that game with only three overseas players. He was carrying drinks in that game with no disappointment on his face. He taught me selflessness. Ryan ten Doeschate (sic).\"\n\nIt’s not a secret that the BCCI prefer Indian coaches, so it will be interesting to see how they react to this demand of Gambhir who has requested a free hand in managing the team. The BCCI might not prefer having two assistant coaches for a national team. They could give Nayar the batting coach role and make ten Doeschate the assistant coach.\n\nT Dilip, who served as the fielding coach under outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid, is likely to be retained. As far as the bowling coach is concerned, the names of Lakshmipathy Balaji and Vinay Kumar have been doing the rounds, but it is believed that the BCCI is seeking a higher-profile candidate who would mentor and mould the upcoming crop of fast bowlers.\n\nGambhir and his support staff will take charge of the side from the Sri Lanka tour, consisting of three T20 Internationals (T20I) and as many One-Day Internationals (ODI), starting July 27.",

    "body": "India’s newly-appointed head coach Gautam Gambhir is reportedly pushing for the inclusion of former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate into the team's coaching staff.\n\nTen Doeschate recently worked with Gambhir at the Kolkata Knight Riders, where he played the role of a fielding coach during their triumphant IPL 2024 campaign.\n\nMoreover, Ten Doeschate holds multiple positions within KKR’s subsidiaries in the Caribbean Premier League, Major League Cricket, and ILT20.\n\nAccording to a report published in Cricbuzz, Gambhir, who has requested a free hand in managing the team, wants the former Dutch cricketer as one of his key associates.\n\nHowever, the final call will be made by the BCCI, which has favoured hiring only Indian personnel for coaching roles in recent years.\n\nThe report also claims that the board is already discussing Ryan ten Doeschate's name but it wants T Dilip to continue in his role as the fielding coach. In that case, the Dutchman might be considered for a different role.\n\nEarlier, multiple reports suggested that Gautam Gambhir wants to bring along Abhishek Nayar as his assistant coach for the Indian team.\n\nNayar, who has represented India in three ODIs, currently serves as assistant coach at the Kolkata Knight Riders. He also holds the position of director at the KKR academy\n\nIf the BCCI secures the services of both Abhishek Nayar and Ryan ten Doeschate, it will leave a major void in KKR's coaching setup.\n\nGambhir, who replaced Rahul Dravid as India's head coach, will begin his stint with the white-ball tour of Sri Lanka later this month.",

    "body": "Known to be arguably the best six-hitter in T20 cricket, West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell made his way again with a magical 107-meter six. Representing the Los Angeles Knight Riders of MLC in the USA’s Major League Cricket, Russell launched Pakistan’s Haris Rauf for a towering six off his final over—the moment went viral on social media courtesy of MLC’s official account.\n\nThis was the case on the third ball of that climactic final over when the phenomenal Jamaican power hitter connected to a pitch-up delivery off Haris Rauf and smashed it well above the mid-wicket stands. This towered strike not only made it the longest six of MLC season two but added plausible runs to LAKR’s total.\n\nAn unbeaten 25-ball 40 by Andre Russell, which included this phenomenal six, saw his team get to a competitive 165/6 against San Francisco Unicorns. Despite his heroics, LAKR’s total went through.\n\nALSO READ: Jatin Paranjpe Shares Insights On Future Challenges For Gautam Gambhir\n\nThe target was hounded down with consummate ease by the San Francisco Unicorns in 15.2 overs, leaving LAKR with one win and two defeats after three games, which was a disappointing outcome for a team that finished at the bottom of the table last season.\n\nRussell has been phenomenal throughout 2024. He was behind Kolkata Knight Riders’ title win in IPL 2024 when he scored 222 runs and took 19 wickets to be the joint fourth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament. But he couldn’t really replicate that in the 2024 T20 World Cup at home – though the West Indies remained unbeaten during the group stage, they eventually got eliminated in the Super 8 phase.\n\nALSO READ: India’s Participation in 2025 ICC Champions Trophy In Doubt: Possible Shift To Sri Lanka or Dubai\n\nShaking off the disappointment of missing out on the World Cup, Russell linked up with his Kolkata Knight Riders colleague Sunil Narine, who captained LAKR in the MLC. With LAKR due to face the San Francisco Unicorns again on Sunday, July 14, form and experience will be everything as Russell looks to redeem his team and finally notch an important win.",

    "body": "When the first season of Major League Cricket came to a close, the Seattle Orcas showed their class. This year, the result was much different for the team of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSeattle fell in its final match of MLC 2 to the Texas Super Kings, losing by 37 runs.\n\nIt capped a horrid season for the green and gray, as the Orcas managed just two points and finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nSeattle is very South African heavy with its international players, who are coming off a world cup semifinal appearance. To say there were tired legs, would be stating the obvious. “Most of our pros came over straight from the world cup. Even if they won’t agree, they looked a little bit exhausted,” said Orcas All-Rounder Harmeet Singh.\n\nSome of the best South African cricketers have been playing without more than a week’s break for over four months.\n\nThis season just wasn’t to be for the Orcas. Like Seattle’s other bat-to-ball franchise, the Mariners, the Orcas could not put consistent runs on the board.\n\nOver the course of the seven games played this season, Seattle batted second in three of them and chased runs successfully in their lone victory. But when the Orcas were required to put up a high number, Seattle continuously dropped the ball.\n\nWhen opening with the batting, the Orcas have won just one game in their two years of existence. It was all the way back on July 15, 2023, in a win over San Fransisco. But since then, Seattle has lost seven in a row when opening with the paddle.\n\nDespite quite literally nothing bouncing the way of the Orcas in year two, in the final match there looked to be some positives. Ayan Desai made his MLC and Orcas debut taking the ball to start the first over.\n\nWith his first ball he took the wicket of a top-class cricketer in Devon Conway via leg before wicket. That ball was later named the play of the game and was the start of a great first match for Desai.\n\nHe finished with 2 wickets and 30 runs, and an economy of 7.50 which was the third lowest of all bowlers in the game.\n\nIt was just a bleak day with the bat for the Orcas after holding the Super Kings to a pretty manageable 177 after the first innings.\n\nSeattle knew it was going to have to work hard after its top run-scorer Ryan Rickleton was dismissed for a golden duck for the second straight match. Rickleton looked to be the bright spot of the Orca’s 2024 season scoring a century and spent a lot of time on the top of the run scoring table, but in his last two matches never saw a second ball.\n\nNo Orca scored more than 26 runs (Quentin de Kock 19 balls), which pales in comparison to the Super Kings’ three players who scored over 29 in the match.\n\nIt is a season to forget based on results for the Orcas, but MLC season 2 is a year to look back on as the sport of cricket continues to grow in the United States.",
    "summary": "The Seattle Orcas had a disappointing season in MLC 2, finishing at the bottom of the table with only 2 points. They lost their final match to the Texas Super Kings by 37 runs, capping off a poor season. The team, which has a heavy South African presence, struggled with tired international players who came straight from the World Cup. The Orcas struggled to score consistently, particularly when batting first, and failed to win a match when opening with the batting since July 15, 2023. In their final match, Ayan Desai made a promising debut, taking 2 wickets and scoring 30 runs, but the team's batting performance was poor, with no player scoring more than 26 runs. Despite the disappointing season, the article views MLC season 2 as a positive step forward for cricket in the United States.",

Although the result meant nothing in the grand scheme of things, Washington will hope for no psychological effects.\n\nLAST THREE: LWW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: WANTING TO AT LEAST FINISH ON A HIGH\n\nTo beat Washington Freedom earlier in the week and extending their winning run will have served this San Francisco Unicorns squad with a huge injection of confidence ahead of this qualifier, knowing they have the ability to beat their opponents here.\n\nLAST THREE: WWW\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nOpeners Travis Head and Steve Smith have combined for a total of 385 runs over the course of this tournament, with Head blasting 194 and Smith 191. The latter is averaging over 60 and such numbers cannot be ignored from a betting point of view. Back Smith to score over 30+ runs and also back the pair to add over 26.5 runs for the first Washington wicket.\n\nWhilst he is known mainly for his batting, Rachin Ravindra also provides a very handy spin option for the Freedom. Figures of 4/16 against Texas Super Kings is testament to that and any hint of turn at Grand Prairie Stadium will be taken advantage of by the New Zealand international. Therefore, look at backing Ravindra with a small stake to finish as Washington’s top bowler.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nA lot could depend on San Francisco opener Finn Allen in the qualifier as he possesses the power required to tip things in the Unicorn’s favour whether they be setting or chasing a target. Allen’s 186 runs, including 15 sixes have been paramount to his side’s success, so backing Allen to continue his big-hitting exploits and gain over 0.5 match sixes here is worth a play on.\n\nAlso worthy of attention on the batting front is Sanjay Krishnamurthi on the back of his 79 from just 42 balls in the last contest between these two sides. Having performed so well against the same opponent so recently, Krishnamurthi knows what he needs to do to accumulate a significant score again vs Washington and backing him to gain 20+ runs via the ‘Battle Milestones’ market should be considered.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERTPREDICTION\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns may have gotten the better of Washington Freedom when the two teams last collided, but you can be sure that a different Freedom will be on show this time around, with significantly more at stake. The bowling especially should be far tighter on the Washington side and San Francisco will surely not find it as easy to score on this occasion.\n\nExpect Washington to bounce back strongly and whilst their batters should get on top of the Unicorns, this time the Freedom bowlers will likely show a marked improvement and help lead the league stage table toppers to victory.",
    "summary": "**Match Details**\n\n* The match is a qualifier for the final of the Major League Cricket tournament in 2024.\n* The teams playing are Washington Freedom (league winners) and San Francisco Unicorns (second-place finishers).\n* The match will take place on Thursday, July 25, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas, United States.\n\n**Team Forms**\n\n* Washington Freedom lost their last match against San Francisco Unicorns, ending their unbeaten record in the tournament.

    "date": "Tue Jul 23 09:46:26 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 is seeing a superb season for Australian cricketer Steve Smith, who was recently seen as the king of cricket grounds. Smith has not had a place in the Australian T20I team but showed his prowess with the bat again and became the talk of the town on Monday, July 22. Washington Freedom’s team leader provided bowling skills at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas against the San Francisco Unicorns, proving his unerring style even in the modern mode of the game.\n\nThe test specialist Steve Smith gave a rude reminder of that by cutting loose against the bowlers for 56 of 31 balls. He also set five boundaries and four maximums, two of which were stunning and caught the attention of MLC’s social media team. That flexibility alone was on display in the dressing-room speech, reminding everyone why he is widely considered one of cricket’s premier players of all time.\n\nGreat Figures in MLC 2024\n\nSince the start of the season, Steve Smith has proved to be one of the best players for the Washington Freedom. He has 247 runs to his credit in the seven games and has scored an average of 61.75. with a magnificent strike rate of 144.44. These figures put him in the position of the principal run-maker in the competition, a position next to Faf du Plessis, who has amassed 264 runs, and his teammate Travis Head, who has scored 250 runs.\n\nSmith and his valuable properties have played a significant role in the Washington Freedom’s campaign to attain and maintain a solid standing in leagues.\n\nThe Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns will face each other once more on Friday in the first semifinal of the tournament. Both teams qualified for the playoffs with five equal wins; therefore, the following match was expected. Even with the six-wicket loss to San Francisco in the recent match that adopted the DLS method in Washington’s first match defeat of the season, the side is fully optimistic, and Smith has a lot of trust in them.\n\nSteve Smith’s Journey and Revival in MLC\n\nWhat is perhaps even more powerful is that this journey in MLC 2024 has been told through the story of Smith. He has experienced some misfortune in the international T20 chase, and then this spec allows him to reintroduce himself. This characteristic has been a boost to Washington Freedom because he can stabilize the innings and yet be very aggressive when the game calls for it. This season, Steve Smith has not only shown good technique but also the good strategies that you expect from a captain and a leader of the team.\n\nHowever, a noteworthy aspect of Steve Smith is his captaincy for the Washington Freedom, besides the batting. This is because he has been around, and he is the one who uses his maturity in dealing with the team when it is steamed up. The young players within the team have thus greatly benefited from him, and Washington has become one of the most balanced and charged teams in the tournament.\n\nEverybody will focus on the performance of Steve Smith in Major League Cricket 2024 as the competition goes on. His comeback to T20 cricket is a sign of versatility and the ambition of the player seeking to be the best. Looking at the coming rounds of matches and the knockout stages, especially, Steve Smith and his ability to lead the team will be very vital to the success of the Washington Freedom.\n\nIn any case, the MLC 2024 season alone is more than enough to establish Steve Smith as the most prominent cricketer of the current and perhaps future generations, thereby expressing that class and quality in the cricket field do not have an expiration date at the international level.",
    "summary": "* Australian cricketer Steve Smith is having a great season in MLC 2024, showcasing his batting prowess and captaincy skills for the Washington Freedom team.\n* In a recent match against the San Francisco Unicorns, Smith scored 56 runs off 31 balls, with 5 boundaries and 4 maximums, displaying his flexibility and unerring style in the modern mode of the game.\n* Smith has been one of the top performers in MLC 2024, with 247 runs in 7 games at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 144.44, making him one of the principal run-makers in the competition.\n* He has played a significant role in the Washington Freedom's campaign, helping the team maintain a solid standing in the league.\n* The Washington Freedom will face the San Francisco Unicorns again in the first semifinal of the tournament on Friday, and Smith is optimistic about his team's chances despite a recent loss.\n* Smith's journey in MLC 2024 is a story of revival, as he has experienced misfortune in international T20 cricket, but is now reintroducing himself as a force to be reckoned with.\n* His captaincy skills have also been instrumental in the team's success, and his maturity and experience have benefited the young players in the team.",

All three were part of the Kolkata Knight Riders coaching staff in IPL 2024. Gambhir was the mentor, Nayar the assistant coach, and Ten Doeschate was designated as the team's fielding coach. The former Netherlands star, in fact, played five seasons under Gambhir's captaincy in KKR. Between 2011 and 2015, ten Doeschate featured in 41 matches for KKR. He was inducted into the three-time champions' support staff even before Gambhir came on board for the last season.\n\nThis is the first time the Indian cricket setup is seeing two assistant coaches. Notably, there was no such post during Anil Kumble, Ravi Shastri or Rahul Dravid's tenures. There was a batting coach, a bowling coach, a fielding coach and other support staff members comprising throwdown specialists, physios, analysts and others.\n\nThings are slightly different in Gambhir's tenure, at least as things stand now. He has appointed two assistant coaches in Nayar and ten Doeschate. There are no mentions of a batting coach. T Dilip, Inda's fielding coach during Dravid's tenure, has got an extension. Regarding the bowling coach, NCA coach Sairaj Bahutule is in Sri Lanka as a stop-gap arrangement. There are reports of Gambhir showing interest in getting former South Africa pacer Morne Morkel, another old associate of the former India opener, on board.\n\nThere are no official announcements from the BCCI regarding Gambhir's support staff, but it will likely come after the Sri Lanka tour.\n\nGambhir eager to work with Nayar and ten Doeschate\n\n“Really happy with the BCCI.

Led by Faf du Plessis' quickfire fifty, the fastest by a batter this season, the Texas Super Kings had a strong start to their run-chase.\n\nAlso Read | QPR vs Tottenham Hotspur, Club Friendly 2024 Live Streaming Online in India: How To Watch Pre-Season Football Match Live Telecast on TV & Football Score Updates in IST?.\n\nThe Proteas opener propelled his team to 76 runs in the powerplay. However, Washington's bowlers executed a brilliant comeback in the middle overs. Jasdeep Singh, Glenn Maxwell, and Ravindra shared the 10 wickets among them, but it was Lockie Ferguson's crucial over to Du Plessis after the powerplay that turned the tide. Lockie conceded only 2 wides in that over, eventually leading to Faf's dismissal.\n\nSoon after, the Super Kings' batting lineup crumbled, losing 4 wickets for just 15 runs between overs 7.1 and 11.6, ultimately costing them the match. While Calvin Savage managed to strike a few powerful blows towards the end, it only served to narrow the margin of defeat.\n\nAlso Read | Rangers vs Manchester United, Club Friendly 2024 Live Streaming Online in India: How To Watch Pre-Season Football Match Live Telecast on TV & Football Score Updates in IST?.\n\nEarlier, Washington Freedom posted a formidable target of 206 for the Texas Super Kings. The fireworks began early, with Travis Head delivering a scintillating performance in the powerplay. He hammered 53 runs off just 22 balls, dismantling the seamers with ease and giving Washington a flying start.\n\nAs spin was introduced, the scoring rate slowed slightly, thanks to some purchase on the used pitch. However, Maxwell played a pivotal role in maintaining the momentum, contributing crucial runs in the middle overs. Towards the tail end of the innings, Pienaar provided a valuable boost, ensuring a strong finish for the team.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Smith (57) also continued his consistent performances, nearly batting through the entire innings and securing a well-earned fifty. His steady presence at the crease anchored the Washington innings and kept the scoreboard ticking.\n\nThe start given by the two Australian batters was more than enough for the middle order of the Washington-based side to take on the rest of the bowlers. Maxwell (34) and Obus Pienaar (33) both scored crucial runs to ensure their team put up a tough target that the Texas Super Kings were eventually unable to chase down.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom 206/5 (Steve Smith 57, Travis Head 53, Noor Ahmad 3/38) vs Texas Super Kings 164 (Faf du Plessis 55, Calvin Savage 35, Rachin Ravindra 4/16).

    "body": "26 Jul, 9.39am After all those thrilling finishes in the Major League Cricket 2024, we are now down to the last two games to find out who will lift the title this time. Washington Freedom has already sealed a spot in the Final after winning the Qualifier against San Francisco Unicorns. The challenger though will be played between the winner of Eliminator, Texas Super Kings and the loser of the Qualifier, San Francisco Unicorns at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. Both sides faced each other earlier in the tournament and it was Texas Super Kings who won that contest by 7 wickets. The contest between the Texas Super Kings and San Francisco Unicorns has every ingredient of being a cagey contest with both sides depending on their top order while the bowling is their mainstay. The skipper of Texas Super Kings, Faf du Plessis has led them from the front and sits on top of the run-getters chart and his partner Devon Conway also features in the top 5 run-getters of this edition. The worrying part for the Texas Super Kings is they rely heavily on their top order and the likes of Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Hardie, and the rest of the batting order are yet to deliver when it matters the most. The bowling has done well and the likes of Noor Ahmad, Zia-ul-Haq, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, and Marcus Stoinis have combined well to create a perfect mix of spin and pace. Their opponents on the other hand, San Francisco Unicorns do bat heavy at the top but do possess threatening batters in the middle order as well. Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, and Sanjay Krishnamurthi form an explosive top three while players such as Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford comprise a solid middle order. The bowling looks balanced too with Pat Cummins leading the bowling attack along with Haris Rauf, Carmi le Roux, and Juanoy Drysdale while Hassan Khan will look to trap the opposition batters with his left-arm spinners. With two sides equally capable of dismantling their opponents, this promises to be no less than a thriller.",

The spin pair of Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell kept things tight as only 26 runs came in the next six overs with SFU losing two more wickets.\n\nAfter attaining some stability, the SFU innings suffered once again as Jansen accounted for Anderson to get his third dismissal of the night. The last five wickets fell for just 18 runs as they closed out in 145.\n\nChasing 146, Travis Head carted three sixes and two fours off Carmi le Roux as we got past the fifty-run mark at the end of the powerplay.\n\nHead coasted to his half-century off just 28 balls in the 10th over as Maxwell shifted gears soon after with back-to-back sixes off Hassan.

Saif Badar scored 35 off 28 balls for the Knight Riders.\n\nIn response, we reached 130/2 in 16 overs with Travis Head top-scoring in the contest with 54 off just 32 balls. The southpaw’s first fifty in MLC was laden with six sixes and two fours. Our skipper Steve Smith hit two sixes and two fours to remain unbeaten on 42 off 36 balls.\n\nOpting to bowl first, Netravalkar struck with his first ball of the day to beat LAKR Skipper Sunil Narine for a duck. The left-arm pacer made his first over even more memorable with the wicket of Unmukt Chand off the last ball.\n\nSmith introduced spinner Maxwell in the third over. The off-spinner reaped immediate reward going through the gate of Shakib Al Hasan as LAKR were three down with the score reading just 13. Soon it became 18/4 with Lockie Ferguson also getting into the act to clean up Jason Roy.\n\nMaxwell returned to pick up two more wickets including the big-hitting Andre Russell, who was dismissed for 20. Netravalkar polished off the tail to end with four wickets as the LAKR innings folded up for 129. Meanwhile, Ferguson also chipped in with 2/31 in four overs.\n\nChasing a modest target, Smith and Head gave us a flying start racing to 61 at the end of the powerplay. Head was particularly severe smashing sixes off all four bowlers introduced in the first six overs as 44 runs came from boundaries during the period.\n\nHead brought up his fifty, off just 27 balls, in style with a huge six down the ground as the Australian duo added 79 for the opening wicket, the highest partnership for us, for any wicket in the history of MLC.\n\nSmith took charge once Head departed and remained unbeaten to see us through with four overs to spare. Smith jumped to second in the overall batting charts of MLC 2024 with 126 runs at an unbelievable average of 126.00 and a strike rate of 140.00.\n\nAfter yet another victory, we continue on top of the MLC 2024 points table with seven points from four matches.\n\nWe are up against MI New York in our next match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Tuesday.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders vs Washington Freedom MLC 2024 brief scores: LAKR 129/10 in 18.4 overs (Saif Badar 35, Andre Russell 20, Saurabh Netravalkar 4/35, Glenn Maxwell 3/15) vs WF 130/2 in 16 overs (Travis Head 54, Steve Smith 42, Shadley van Schalkwyk 1/17, Spencer Johnson 1/33).\n\nWashington Freedom won by eight wickets.",

    "title": "America’s Major League Cricket Set To Ride Momentum Of T20 World Cup",
    "date": "Fri Jul  5 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "After a momentous T20 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., marked by a $30 million cricket stadium in New York along with a stirring underdog performance by the national team, hopes are high for a pivotal second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nWhile this year's marquee cricket tournament was expectantly mostly in the shadows in the world's biggest sports market, it did receive significant exposure with coverage in media institutions like The New York Times, CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nNo one thinks it will become mainstream in the U.S. but the sleeping giant - with cricket by some metrics the second most popular sport in the world - has finally awakened.\n\nIt came just before the much-anticipated second season of MLC, the lucrative professional T20 league in the U.S. luring top players around the world. MI New York and Seattle Orcas launched the latest edition on Friday in a rematch of last year's final.\n\nAs I reported, the MLC's historic first season exceeded financial targets with revenues of $8 million, but its launch was undoubtedly helped by the novelty factor after previous attempts by administrators to strike gold in America failed.\n\nForbesAmerica's Major League Cricket Debut Surpassed Expectations On And Off The Field\n\n\"Could have been some element of that (novelty factor), but I think this fanbase is looking for high quality cricket on the field,\" MLC chief executive Vijay Srinivasan told me.\n\n\"We want to make sure of the standards befitting American professional sports and I think we delivered that (last season) and were recognized in the world of cricket.\"\n\nMLC has been able to secure major sponsorship deals, highlighted by Cognizant - a multinational information technology services and consulting company - becoming its first title sponsor.\n\n\"We are growing. We definitely have been very successful in sponsorship sales and certainly we want to deliver and show value,\" Srinivasan said.\n\nAs I reported previously, salary caps for teams are to remain the same, but top players will still be handsomely remunerated and earn around $175,000 for a minimum of five games - rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nWhile Indian players are not allowed to play outside of the IPL, a slew of stars will play in this season's MLC - many from Australia highlighted by San Francisco's marquee signing of Pat Cummins to a four-year deal.\n\nAhead of this season, MLC received official T20 league status with tournament playing records counted towards format statistics.\n\n\"The goal is to be competitive (financially) with the top leagues and there will be adjustment that happens as we grow,\" Srinivasan said. \"That's (salary caps) something we'll have to review every season.\n\n\"We've got some really strong names coming here. Ultimately, the teams and the players are what defines the product.\"\n\nWhile things are looking rosy in American cricket, there has been familiar warring behind the scenes with governing body USA Cricket amid continual turmoil after a spate of resignations and chief executive Dr. Noor Murad having his contract terminated earlier this year.\n\nAs I reported in April, USA Cricket avoided calls for suspension, but its funding is being 'controlled' by the sport's governing body. The situation is likely to be a talking point at the International Cricket Council's upcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\nForbes'Controlled Funding' Put In Place For USA Cricket Ahead Of Home T20 World Cup\n\nUSA Cricket sanctions MLC, which is administered by American Cricket Enterprises after signing a 50-year commercial rights agreement in 2019.\n\n\"Governance is always a challenge, but it needs to sort itself out,\" Srinivasan, a co-founder of ACE, said. \"We are certainly hopeful that things will stabilize.\"\n\nThere are plans to expand MLC, with Chicago and Atlanta touted as possible new franchises amid a longer tournament earmarked to be played over much of June and July moving forward.\n\nBut, right now, MLC is hoping to continue the trajectory of the British bat and ball sport with deep roots in a cricket backwater. While figures have varied, with the sport's governing body having claimed that there are 50 million cricket fans in the U.S., there is already an invested fanbase for MLC.\n\n\"Willow (cricket broadcaster into North America) goes into around four-five million homes, so that probably translates to a fanbase of something in the range of 10 million people,\" Srinivasan said.\n\n\"There's a lot of interest and excitement in MLC after the T20 World Cup. I think we can ride that momentum.\"",
    "summary": "**Season 2 of MLC**: The second season of MLC has kicked off with a rematch between MI New York and Seattle Orcas, following a successful first season that exceeded financial targets with revenues of $8 million.\n\n**Expanding Reach**: The tournament has secured major sponsorship deals, including a title sponsorship with Cognizant, and has received official T20 league status, with tournament playing records counted towards format statistics.\n\n**Player Contracts**: Top players will earn around $175,000 for a minimum of five games, rivaling figures in other T20 leagues outside of the Indian Premier League. Stars from Australia, including Pat Cummins, will participate in this season's MLC.\n\n**Future Plans**: There are plans to expand MLC, with Chicago and Atlanta touted as possible new franchises, and a longer tournament earmarked to be played over much of June and July in the future.\n\n**Challenges**: Despite the progress, MLC faces challenges, including governance issues with USA Cricket, the sport's governing body in the US.\n\n**Fanbase**: MLC has an invested fanbase, with cricket broadcaster Willow reaching around 4-5 million homes, translating to a fanbase of around 10 million people. The tournament hopes to ride the momentum generated by the recent T20 World Cup.",

    "body": "The Major League Cricket 2024 season commenced on Friday with MI New York beginning their title defense with a commanding six-wicket win over the Seattle Orcas. All eyes were on Nicholas Pooran at Church Street Park in Morrisville as the West Indian wicketkeeper-batter continued his form from the 2023 edition. His unbeaten 62 off just 37 balls helped MI New York chase down 109 in just 14.2 overs. With the early wickets of Ruben Clinton (6) and USA’s national team skipper Monank Patel (8), the initial momentum seemed to be in the Seattle Orcas’ favor. Cameron Gannon was the main bowling aggressor, dismissing both batters in the third over and giving his team a ray of hope.\n\nBut then, Pooran proceeded to hit Gannon for two sixes and as many fours in his next over, turning the tide in MI New York’s favor. Eventually, Pooran’s power-hitting abilities proved to be too much for the Seattle Orcas. They got the wickets of Shayan Jahangir (3) and Tim David (12) as well, but the left-handed Pooran and his countryman Kieron Pollard (8*) took their team over the line for their first win of MLC 2024. Earlier in the day, the skills of the MI New York bowlers were on display as they bowled out the Seattle Orcas for just 108 runs. Rashid Khan and Trent Boult bagged three wickets each, never really allowing their opponents to settle into the match.\n\nNew Zealand’s star pacer Boult got the early breakthrough in the opening over itself, sending Nauman Anwar back to the pavilion for a duck. The Pakistan batter’s late attempt to cut the ball away caught a faint edge which traveled to the wicketkeeper and eventual match-winner, Nicholas Pooran. With Quinton de Kock (5) still in the crease, the Seattle Orcas could still hit a competitive score, but he was also gone in Boult’s next over. His attempt to hit the ball through the leg side was met with a top edge, and Pooran did well to get underneath it and send de Kock back to the pavilion.\n\nFrom then on, MI New York were in the driving seat, getting regular wickets. For the Seattle Orcas, Shubham Ranjane ended as the highest run-getter with a tidy innings of 35 runs in 31 balls. Finding the boundary regularly, Ranjane proved to be a threat before he tried to hit Rashid Khan for consecutive sixes but fell short in his second attempt, hitting the ball to Tim David instead. Harmeet Singh, who recently featured for the USA in the T20 World Cup, played a 20-run cameo as the side set a target that was eventually chased down by the defending champions with 34 balls to spare.\n\nUNMUKT CHAND STARS FOR LA KNIGHT RIDERS\n\nIn the second match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket, Los Angeles Knight Riders put up a brilliant show to take down the Texas Super Kings by 12 runs at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, on the opening night of the season. Unmukt Chand's brilliant 68 off 45 balls powered the LA Knight Riders to a total of 162/7 in their allotted 20 overs. Ali Khan then delivered a match-winning performance, taking four wickets for 33 runs, to restrict the Texas Super Kings to 150/8, clinching the win by 12 runs.\n\nOn what turned out to be a challenging batting wicket, the Texas Super Kings began their chase of 163 runs cautiously. Skipper Faf du Plessis (14 off 14), who attempted to accelerate the run rate, was dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the fifth over. Trying his signature scoop, he mistimed the shot and was caught by Derone Davis at mid-wicket. Aaron Hardie (11 off 14) was then sent packing by Shakib Al Hasan in the ninth over.\n\nOpener Devon Conway kept the scoreboard ticking, steadily taking the Super Kings closer to the target with timely boundaries. However, Ali Khan turned things around for the LA Knight Riders by taking three wickets in the 14th over. He bowled Conway, hitting the off-stump, then dismissed Joshua Tromp (18 off 14), who was caught by Derone Davis with a stunning catch, as the ball was flying off the edge to third man. The subsequent delivery saw Milind Kumar (0 off 1) caught at slip by Andre Russell. Marcus Stoinis (2 off 6) fell in the following over, scoring just two off six balls, leaving the Super Kings reeling from 100/2 to 107/6 after 15 overs.\n\nHowever, Calvin Savage took matters into his own hands and kept the Super Kings in the game with a flurry of boundaries and sixes. He, along with Naveen-ul-Haq, smashed 17 runs off Ali Khan in the 18th over to take the equation down to 27 runs from 12 balls. Russell and Khan then bowled exceptional final two overs to close out the game for LA Knight Riders.",

They have a seriously strong side all-round with the likes of Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen, Rachin Ravindra, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andries Gous and Lockie Ferguson in their squad.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWW\n\nMI NEW YORK FORM: WINNING MACHINE\n\nMI New York cruised to an opening game victory against the team that they defeated in the final, the Seattle Orcas, after they skittled the Orcas for 108 in 19.1 overs yesterday. They gave teams a head start after a poor beginning to the 2023 campaign before clicking and they appear to have clicked almost immediately this time around.\n\nLAST THREE: WWWL\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Washington Freedom have an excellent side throughout but the one man, of the many, that they will rely upon for quick runs at the top of the order will be the ever impressive and still improving Travis Head. Backing the Aussie T20 opener and potential future captain to be their best bat in this one looks a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, MI New York lost both of their openers, Ruben Clifton and Monank Patel, to the change up right arm medium bowling of Cameron Gannon. That will leave Andrew Tye licking his lips and Tye to take two or more wickets is something worth having a look at here.\n\nMI NEW YORK BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nLast season, the excellence of West Indian Nicholas Pooran saw him become the tournament’s top run scorer and he got off to another strong start the other night in what proved to be a match-winning knock in a small chase. Backing Pooran to continue his fine form is always fairly safe and him scoring 30 or more seems a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, MI New York ripped through the Orcas’ top order in the powerplay with the excellent Trent Boult taking 3-25 in the end off his four overs. Rashid Khan’s spin also claimed three wickets and that is a known weakness of Head so Khan or Boult taking two or more wickets appears a more than reasonable bet.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS MI NEW YORK EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nNow then, this one might actually be tough to call. Whilst MI New York began with a comfortable victory in their opening game and they are the defending champions of this competition, the Washington Freedom have real star names of the T20 circuit littered throughout their side and will be captained by an excellent tactician in Steve Smith. One bet that seems a decent shout, though, is for Pooran to continue his good form and even top sore in the match, once again.",

Captained by Corey Anderson, there is plenty of experience in the Unicorns’ side such as Pat Cummins, Matt Henry and Liam Plunkett but the star attraction is likely to be West Indian all-rounder Sherfane Rutherford.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: A TERRIBLE FIRST SEASON\n\nIn contrast to the Unicorns’ narrow miss on the top four last season, the Los Angeles Knight Riders, affiliated with Indian Premier League side the Kolkata Knight Riders, endured a miserable campaign last season. LAKR began with four defeats, and all four defeats were fairly heavy, before finishing the season, in last place, with a slender two-wicket defeat against league winners Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLLL\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe biggest weakness in a weak LAKR side would be their bowling department so San Francisco Unicorns to score big runs would appear quite likely. There aren’t too many standout candidates for that role, though, with emphasis on their own bowling but one man who will be key to any success is likely to be Jake Fraser-McGurk, set to be a leading light of Australia’s next white-ball era. Fraser-McGurk to start his newest franchise journey off well as their top scorer in this match would be worth a shot.\n\nIn the bowling attack, T20 has arguably been Pat Cummins’ weakest format but the Australian Test captain took hat-tricks in successive matches at the World Cup so will come into this feeling a bit of form. Cummins to begin his campaign with two or more wickets seems a good bet.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nAs mentioned, LAKR’s weakness is probably with the ball but with the bat they are not too much stronger, at least on paper. Former England international Jason Roy is likely to be in the top three but it will be middle-order hitting they rely on and, in particular, David Miller who is likeliest to be their best batter in most matches.\n\nWith the ball, though, they will believe that some skilful bowling will be able to hurt what is not the most star-studded Unicorns lineup. That is where the excellent spin of Adam Zampa comes into play and the Australian international to take two or more wickets seems a good bet.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS VS LOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThese two were the weakest teams in the competition last season but both sides will be hoping to be a little rejuvenated this time around. There is one clear ‘top tip’ to offer here, though. The Unicorns’ strength is in their pace-bowling attack, whilst LAKR look quite weak at the top of the order. Naturally, then, if the Unicorns open up with seam, LAKR may well struggle and that should result in the San Francisco Unicorns having the better of the powerplay and the higher opening stand.",

    "body": "The teams, the format, the big names, and everything else you might have been wondering about\n\nAbhimanyu Bose\n\n05-Jul-2024 • 20 hrs ago\n\nDid you think the cricket fever would die in the USA after the T20 World Cup? Think again, because the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) is upon us. The first edition had high scores and thrilling individual performances as some of the biggest names in T20 cricket showcased their talent in Texas and North Carolina. So what's in store for us this year? Find all your answers here.\n\nFirst things first. When does it start?\n\nThe first match is on Friday, July 5, with MI New York taking on Seattle Orcas in Morrisville. The tournament will go on till July 28. There will be a total of 25 matches.\n\nSo who are the teams participating? And who won it the first time around?\n\nThe six teams are Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom.\n\nIt was MI New York, inspired by a whirlwind Nicholas Pooran century, who beat Seattle Orcas in the final to win the inaugural title.\n\nAre you sure it's the MLC and not the IPL? There seem to be a lot of familiar names...\n\nThat's because IPL franchises have invested in most of the teams in the tournament, as they have in other franchise leagues like SA20, ILT20 and the CPL. IPL franchises own four teams in the MLC. Apart from the three obvious ones, Seattle Orcas are owned by the GMR Group, who co-own Delhi Capitals.\n\nWashington Freedom, owned by Indian-American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil, have Cricket New South Wales as their high-performance partner. San Francisco Unicorns, owned by Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, have a partnership with Cricket Victoria.\n\nWe saw games in New York and Lauderhill in the T20 World Cup, apart from Dallas. Will the MLC also be played in those grounds?\n\nNo. This year's MLC, like in 2023, will only be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina's Morrisville.\n\nLast season, the first eight league games were played in Dallas and the next seven in Morrisville, before the tournament shifted back to Dallas for the knockout rounds. This year, however, both stadiums will host games throughout the season.\n\nSo you said Pooran played the last season. Who are some other big names that were there last season and will play this year as well?\n\nA total of 23 overseas players who turned out in the inaugural season will be in action in MLC 2024 as well. Among them, some of the big names include Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Heinrich Klaasen and Kieron Pollard.\n\nAfghanistan's left-arm wristspinner Noor Ahmad will replace Daryl Mitchell - who has been ruled out by an injury and is currently doing rehab in New Zealand - for Texas Super Kings. You can find the full list of retained overseas players here.\n\nAnd any exciting new additions this year?\n\nYes indeed. Pat Cummins, Travis Head and Steven Smith are some high-profile Australian signings, while Daryl Mitchell, Shakib Al Hasan and Romario Shepherd are some of the other new signings. You can see the full squads here.\n\nUSA pulled off a surprise and made it to the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup. So who will their local heroes line up for?\n\nUSA did have an impressive showing at the T20 World Cup, with a Super Over win over Pakistan the highlight. Their captain Monank Patel, Noshthush Kenjige and Shayan Jahangir will be representing defending champions MI New York, while last year's runners-up Seattle Orcas have USA vice-captain Aaron Jones and Harmeet Singh in their ranks.\n\nMilind Kumar, who took a blinder against Pakistan as a substitute fielder, will play for Texas Super Kings, while Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar will play for Washington Freedom.\n\nAll this sounds good. So, what is the format of the league?\n\nLike most franchise leagues, the MLC will first have a round-robin league stage. Last year, each team played the other once, but this time every team will play seven matches each in the league stage. This has contributed to the tournament growing from 19 games last year to 25 this season.\n\nThe top two teams will meet in the Qualifier, with the winners of that match advancing to the final.\n\nThe third and fourth-placed teams will meet in the Eliminator. The winner of the Eliminator will face the team that loses the Qualifier in the Challenger, where the second finalist will be decided.\n\nYou can see the full fixture list here.\n\nBut the MLC games don't count as official T20s, right?\n\nThat was the case last year, but the tournament has been given List A status by the ICC. It has become the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire List A status from the ICC, following the UAE's ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThis means MLC will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics.\n\nAnd with the packed cricket schedule, is it not clashing with any of the several other T20 leagues around the world?\n\nThe Lanka Premier League is on till July 21, so Matheesha Pathirana will remain unavailable till Colombo Strikers are knocked out.\n\nThere will also be a six-day clash with the Hundred , which means that 12 players who are part of the MLC could arrive late at the UK.\n\nAbhimanyu Bose is a sub-editor with ESPNcricinfo",
    "summary": "**Tournament Details**\n\n* The second season of MLC starts on July 5 and ends on July 28, with a total of 25 matches.\n* The tournament will be played at two venues: Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\n**Teams**\n\n* There are six teams participating: Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, and Washington Freedom.\n* IPL franchises own four teams in the MLC, while Seattle Orcas are owned by the GMR Group, and Washington Freedom have Cricket New South Wales as their high-performance partner.\n\n**Big Names**\n\n* 23 overseas players who played in the inaugural season will return, including Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Heinrich Klaasen, and Kieron Pollard.\n* New signings include Pat Cummins, Travis Head, Steven Smith, Daryl Mitchell, Shakib Al Hasan, and Romario Shepherd.\n\n**Local Heroes**\n\n* USA cricketers who will participate in the tournament include Monank Patel, Noshthush Kenjige, Shayan Jahangir, Aaron Jones, Harmeet Singh, Milind Kumar, Andries Gous, and Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\n**Format**\n\n* The tournament will follow a round-robin league stage, where each team will play seven matches.\n* The top two teams will meet in the Qualifier, with the winners advancing to the final.\n* The third and fourth-placed teams will meet in the Eliminator, with the winner facing the team that loses the Qualifier in the Challenger.\n\n**Official Status**\n\n* MLC has been given List A status by the ICC, making it an official T20 league.\n* Tournament playing records will now be counted as official format statistics.\n\n**Scheduling Conflicts**\n\n* There will be a clash with the Lanka Premier League, which ends on July 21, and the Hundred, which means 12 players may arrive late in the UK.",

Ali Khan then delivered a match-winning performance, taking four wickets for 33 runs, to restrict the Texas Super Kings to 150/8, clinching the win by 12 runs.\n\nOn what turned out to be a challenging batting wicket, the Texas Super Kings began their chase of 163 runs cautiously. Skipper Faf du Plessis (14 off 14), who attempted to accelerate the run rate, was dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the fifth over. Trying his signature scoop, he mistimed the shot and was caught by Derone Davis at mid-wicket. Aaron Hardie (11 off 14) was then sent packing by Shakib Al Hasan in the ninth over.\n\nOpener Devon Conway kept the scoreboard ticking, steadily taking the Super Kings closer to the target with timely boundaries. However, Ali Khan turned things around for the LA Knight Riders by taking three wickets in the 14th over. He bowled Conway, hitting the off-stump, then dismissed Joshua Tromp (18 off 14), who was by Derone Davis with a stunning catch, as the ball was flying off the edge to third man. The subsequent delivery saw Milind Kumar (0 off 1) caught at slip by Andre Russell. Marcus Stoinis (2 off 6) fell in the following over, scoring just two off six balls, leaving the Super Kings reeling from 100/2 to 107/6 after 15 overs.\n\nHowever, Calvin Savage took matters into his hands and kept the Super Kings in the game with a flurry of boundaries and sixes. He along with Naveen-ul-Haq smashed 17 runs off Ali Khan in the 18th over to take the equation down to 27 runs from 12 balls. Russell and Khan then bowled exceptional final two overs to close out the game for LA Knight Riders.\n\nEarlier in the contest, Texas Super Kings won the toss and opted to bowl first. Zia-ul-Haq shook the LA Knight Riders' lineup, dismissing both openers, Jason Roy (2 off 11) and Sunil Narine (2 off 3), in the third over, leaving the Knight Riders struggling at 10/2 after three overs.\n\nUnmukt Chand and Shakib Al Hasan attempted to steady the innings, but the latter fell to Aaron Hardie in the seventh over, having scored 18 off 13 balls. Nitish Kumar then added 26 runs off 17 deliveries before being dismissed in the 11th over, with the score at 78/4.\n\nDespite the rapid fall of wickets, including those of impactful players like David Miller (4 off 9) and Andre Russell (10 off 5), Chand kept one end intact. He played a magnificent knock of 68 runs from 45 balls, laced with six boundaries and three sixes, to anchor the Knight Riders' innings. He got out in the last over, but Corne Dry's onslaught of three fours off Marcus Stoinis powered the LA Knight Riders to a respectable total of 162/7 in 20 overs\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Stats\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Fall of wickets: 1-4 (Jason Roy - 2.1 ov), 2-5 (Sunil Narine - 2.5 ov), 3-44 (Shakib Al Hasan - 6.4 ov), 4-78 (Nitish Kumar - 10.3 ov), 5-95 (David Miller - 13.2 ov), 6-106 (Andre Russell - 14.2 ov), 7-150 (Unmukt Chand - 19.2 ov)\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-30 (Faf du Plessis - 4.3 ov), 2-64 (Aaron Hardie - 8.5 ov), 3-102 (Devon Conway - 13.2 ov), 4-103 (Joshua Tromp - 13.5 ov), 5-103 (Milind Kumar - 13.6 ov), 6-107 (Marcus Stoinis - 14.6 ov), 7-115 (Gerald Coetzee - 16.4 ov), 8-120 (Mohammad Mohsin - 17.2 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nNaveen ul Haq\n\nGerald Coetzee\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nUnmukt Chand(WK)\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nJason Roy\n\nDavid Miller\n\nAndre Russell\n\nSunil Narine(C)\n\nShakib Al Hasan\n\nAli Khan\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nDerone Davis\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Saturday, July 6, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: Texas Super Kings elected to bowl",

In 7 matches, he accumulated 143 runs at a strike rate of 126.54 with the best score of 61.\n\nTop Pick – All-Rounder\n\nDwayne Bravo played his role exceptionally well for Texas Super Kings in the first season.

They signed some of the big names for the forthcoming season including the likes of Aiden Markram, Dwayne Bravo, Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Hardie, Gerald Coetzee, Naveen ul Haq, and Noor Ahmad (replacement for injured Daryl Mitchell).\n\nMatheesha Pathirana who is currently involved in Lanka Premier League is expected to join the squad later in the tournament. Saiteja Mukkamalla, Milind Kumar, Mohammad Mohsin, Cameron Stevenson, Zia Shahzad, Calvin Salvage, and Zia ul Haq are the 7 local players retained by the franchise. With only six overseas players allowed to feature in the playing eleven, it’s a hectic task for skipper Faf du Plessis and head coach Stephen Fleming to field the best possible eleven.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders didn’t meet the expectations in the first edition of the Major League Cricket as they finished last in the standings, claiming only two points. They didn’t recover from the poor batting display at the start where they bowled out for 112 and 50 against Super Kings and MI New York respectively.\n\nThey retained four players from the previous season namely Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Spencer Johnson, and skipper Sunil Narine.

    "body": "by Smit Patel • Last updated on\n\nMI New York were the inaugural champions © MLC\n\nCricket in America again?\n\nYes. The new kid on the block in world cricket is back again albeit for a private bash this time. Major League Cricket (MLC) is returning for its second season, kicking off with a finale rematch from the inaugural season between MI New York and Seattle Orcas on July 5 at 2pm local time in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nErrm, I am new to this MLC thing. American cricket only caught my attention after the World Cup. Who are the teams? How long will the tournament last?\n\nMLC is currently a six-team tournament with an intention to grow into 10. The IPL teams like going global and they did not need an invite to invest in the biggest sports media market in the world. MI New York, Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders are the American offshoots of the respective IPL franchises. GMR, the part owners of Delhi Capitals also own some stake in the Seattle Orcas, co-owned by a consortium led by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. The Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns are owned by tech tycoon Sanjay Govil and a consortium led by Venky Harinarayan and Anand Rajaraman, founders of Junglee respectively. The MLC is a $120m startup with added investments of other Silicon Valley bigwigs.\n\nSeason 1 was a single round-robin followed by the knockouts. Season 2 will see 7 league games followed by the knockouts with the final on July 28 with games in Morrisville and Dallas.\n\nWho all are playing? The tournament starts within a week's time of the World Cup final in Barbados. Surely, your A-list stars are putting their feet up somewhere after a gruelling IPL and world cup odyssey.\n\nWho doesn't like coming to America for a quick round of bat and ball and endless amounts of golf! That's right, some of them hit more golf balls than cricket balls last year with a myriad of spectacular golf courses to choose from. And this is what Pat Cummins had to say after his signing with the Unicorns: \"While cricket is integral to my involvement, the global network and long-term possibilities offered by the owners specifically, and Silicon Valley more broadly presented a unique opportunity for me and my life beyond cricket.\"\n\nSeven members from the Australian T20 World Cup team headed stateside including Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, Tim David and Marcus Stoinis. World cricket's newest sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk will turn up to live up to his hype in the IPL. Some of the South African World Cup contingent namely David Miller, Kagiso Rabada, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen and Anrich Nortje too will scamper to America after Hurricane Beryl disrupted travel schedules. Nicholas Pooran, Sunil Narine and Andre Russel will bring the Caribbean flavour. Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson represent the cream of Kiwi talent in the competition.\n\nWhat about the locals? Is Saurabh Netravalkar playing? Does he have enough leaves now?\n\nFortunately he does. And he will be back on the park for Washington Freedom. USA captain Monank Patel has recuperated from his dreaded shoulder injury and will turn out for MI New York. Steven Taylor, Nosthush Kenjige and Shayan Jahangir are the other USA players on MINY roster. Unmukt Chand was seen refining his wicketkeeping skills and will be buzzing to prove a point after his World Cup snub. Chand has been retained by LAKR along with Nitish Kumar and Ali Khan.\n\nHow's the crowd buzz with no Indian players in the offing?\n\nLast year, Texas Super Kings played all of home night games in front of packed crowds and so did teams like LAKR and MINY. Super Kings fan made a spectacle out of any home game and things weren't that different at the Morrisville. By the end of the season, TSK ran out of whistles and teams like MINY ran short on merchandise despite playing at away venues in Dallas and Morrisville. The league has had a soaring fanbase right from its inception, cashing in on the already established support base of the IPL franchises among cricket watchers in America.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet\n\nTAGS\n\nRELATED STORIES",

New York skipper Kieron Pollard won the toss and opted to field first, putting the Seattle to the test. Despite their best efforts, Seattle struggled to surpass the 100-run mark, ultimately being bowled out for 108 runs in 19.1 overs.\n\nSeattle Orcas’ struggles\n\nShubham Ranjan top-scored for Seattle with 35 runs, including 2 fours and 2 sixes in his 31-ball innings. Harmeet Singh contributed 20 runs off 14 balls, hitting 2 fours and 1 six, while Aaron Jones managed 12 runs off 16 balls with 2 fours. However, the rest of the lineup faltered, with Quinton de Kock, captain Enrique Klassen, Imad Wasim and Michael Bracewell all failing to make significant contributions. New York’s bowling attack, led by Boult and Rashid, proved too formidable. Boult took 3 wickets for 25 runs in his 4 overs, while Rashid claimed 3 wickets for 22 runs. Pollard chipped in with 2 wickets for 11 runs, and Ehsan Adil and Enrique Norkia took 1 wicket each.\n\nNicholas Pooran’s match-winning knock for MI New York\n\nIn reply, New York chased down the target with ease, scoring 111 runs for 4 wickets in just 14.2 overs, securing a six wicket victory with 34 balls remaining. The highlight of the chase was Pooran’s unbeaten 62 runs off 37 balls, an innings that included 7 fours and 2 sixes. Pooran’s aggressive approach and timely boundaries kept the momentum in MI New York’s favour. Pooran was further named Player of the Match for his explosive yet calculated knock.\n\nAlso READ: Star players from IPL 2024 who will feature in the MLC 2024\n\nPooran’s brutal assault against Cameron Gannon\n\nPooran’s assault against Cameron Gannon was the defining moment of New York’s victory. With New York were at one time at a challenging 19/2 in the first four overs of the powerplay, Pooran took charge to change the course of the match. The turning point came in the fifth over, where Pooran unleashed his fury on Gannon, scoring 22 runs off the over and shifting the momentum decisively.\n\nOn the first ball of the over, Pooran played a dot ball, setting the stage for what was to come. The second delivery was slightly full and off-stump, which Pooran dispatched over wide long-on for a massive six, electrifying the crowd. This shot demonstrated his power and ability to seize scoring opportunities. Gannon’s attempt to adjust on the third ball resulted in another delivery in Pooran’s hitting zone, which he sent soaring over midwicket for another six, showcasing his aggressive intent and capacity to build pressure on the bowler.\n\nThe fourth ball saw Pooran smartly taking a double, keeping the scoreboard ticking and retaining the strike. On the fifth ball, Gannon bowled short and wide, and Pooran expertly cut it behind backward point for a four, highlighting his precision and versatility. The final delivery of the over was placed with finesse by Pooran, again behind backward point for another boundary, emphasizing his skill in finding gaps and executing shots with precision.\n\nHere’s the video:",

Major League Cricket (MLC) hosts a professional T20 cricket league in the United States.

The upcoming season marks the second iteration of the league, following its inaugural season in July 2023.\n\nThe upcoming Major League Cricket 2024 season will commence on July 5 (July 6 according to IST). The games will take place at two of the most sought-after venues: Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. It was MI New York, the reigning champions, who snatched the first place in the tournament and outperformed the Seattle Orcas by 7 wickets back in the initial season.\n\nAlso Read: IND vs ZIM T20 Series: Schedule, Time In IST, Venues, Squads And Live Streaming Details\n\nThe Major League Cricket (MLC) has been growing swiftly in its second season with acquisitions like those of Steve Smith, Travis Head, Pat Cummins, and Glenn Maxwell and the addition of coaches such as Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson.

This time around, though, LAKR started with a 12-run victory over the Texas Super Kings in Dallas with an excellent performance, spearheaded by Ali Khan, limiting the hosts throughout their run chase.\n\nLAST THREE: LWWLL\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS FORM: POOR START FOR SEATTLE\n\nOn the other hand, the Seattle Orcas started their 2024 season by being annihilated by MI New York, who defeated them in the final last year. They were skittled for just 108 before allowing that to be comfortably chased, taking just four wickets in 14.2 overs. That leaves them bottom-of-the-table, albeit having played just one game.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWL\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nLAKR’s shortcomings were, though, shown up in their second match when they suffered a six-wicket loss to the San Francisco Unicorns. There is a lack of batting depth or even just batting strength and setting a target of 166 against the Unicorns was nowhere near enough with the opposition chasing it down in just 15.2 overs. It is quite an ageing side with Jason Roy, Sunil Narine, Shakib Al Hasan and Andre Russell but the one player they should bee able to rely upon is David Miller so the South African to be their best batter in this match seems a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, after taking a four-wicket haul in their opening game, Ali Khan went wicket-less against the Unicorns and the attention turned to Aussie quick Spencer Johnson, who took 3-26. Johnson has been excellent since emerging in the last 12-18 months and the left armer to take two or more wickets once again would appear quite likely.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThere is no real pattern to emerge from the Seattle Orcas yet given they have played just one game but there will be fewer concerns about their batting line-up. Quinton de Kock’s form is a question but middle-order hitting from Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen and Harmeet Singh should mean they stay in more matches – unlike against an impressive MI New York. Klaasen is the form player and now, as captain, will need to take some responsibility so a 30+ score from him would be worth backing.\n\nMI New York had the luxury of going slowly in their chase of 109 but that doesn’t mean there wasn’t some good bowling from Nandre Burger and Zaman Khan. It does appear a fairly weak attack, though, and Burger will have to be at the top of his game with him being their best bowler most likely to happen more often than not.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS SEATTLE ORCAS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nIn terms of who will come out on top, despite their very different first seasons in which LAKR finished rock-bottom and Seattle finished top, these are two very different sides. On paper, the Orcas should be set with De Kock at the top but the South African has been out of form for a while now, despite some flashes at the ICC T20 World Cup. If Johnson continues to open the bowling then backing Johnson to have a major impact on the match, up against De Kock initially, will be worth keeping an eye on.",
    "summary": "**Match Details**\n\n* The Los Angeles Knight Riders will take on the Seattle Orcas on Tuesday, July 9th, 2024, at 8:30pm ET at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\n* The weather forecast is clear skies with a temperature of 31°C (87.8°F).\n\n**Team Forms**\n\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders: Started the 2024 season with a 12-run victory over the Texas Super Kings, but then suffered a six-wicket loss to the San Francisco Unicorns. Their last three results are LWWLL.\n* Seattle Orcas: Lost their opening match to MI New York, being skittled for 108 runs, and are currently bottom of the table. Their last three results are LLWWL.\n\n**Betting Analysis**\n\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders: David Miller is a good bet to be their best batter in this match. Spencer Johnson is likely to take two or more wickets.\n* Seattle Orcas: Heinrich Klaasen is expected to score 30+ runs. Nandre Burger is likely to be their best bowler.\n\n**Expert Prediction**\n\n* The match is expected to be closely contested, with the Seattle Orcas' batting lineup being stronger on paper. However, Quinton de Kock's form is a concern. Spencer Johnson's performance could have a major impact on the match, especially against De Kock.",

He scored 31 off 15 balls and took MI New York to 154 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Washington Freedom lost Travis Head quite early. After his dismissal, Steven Smith let loose and smashed Anrich Nortje for 22 runs in his first over. Then the rain arrived and Washington Freedom were ahead in the DLS calculation by 4 runs.

Head, who was dropped by Dwayne Bravo off Zia-ul-Haq on the last ball of the third over, went on to score 24 runs, including two sixes and two fours, in the fourth over. Washington Freedom reached 61/0 after 4 overs before rain halted play.\n\nWith the minimum five overs not completed in the second innings, the DLS method couldn't be applied, hence the match ended in a no result and shared points. Both opening games of Washington Freedom have been rain-affected thus far, but they remain unbeaten and have jumped to the top, while Texas Super Kings are fifth in the points table.\n\nEarlier in the day, Texas Super Kings batted first. Openers Faf du Plessis and birthday boy Devon Conway got Texas Super Kings off to a flying start as they reached 67/0 in the Powerplay. Skipper du Plessis batted fluently while Conway played a supporting role, with the duo adding 109 runs in no time. Conway was the first to fall, dismissed by Saurabh Netravalkar in the 11th over after scoring 39 runs off 26 balls. The Super Kings then lost their second wicket in the following over when Aaron Hardie (2 off 5) was trapped LBW by Akeal Hosein, leaving them at 114/2 after 12 overs.\n\nAussie all-rounder Marcus Stoinis joined du Plessis and kept the scoreboard ticking at a rapid pace. Despite picking up an injury to his right hand in the 14th over, Stoinis played a vital cameo of 29 off 18 balls, forming a partnership of 62 off 29 balls with the skipper before being caught by Mukhtar Ahmed off Justin Dill in the 17th over.\n\nMeanwhile, du Plessis continued as he reached his century in 56 balls, taking the Texas Super Kings to 188/3 after 18 overs. He was immediately caught by Steve Smith at extra cover off Saurabh Netravalkar in the following over, but the TSK batters ensured they crossed the 200-run mark. This was the first time a score of 200 was achieved at this venue and the first time any team crossed this mark this season, courtesy of du Plessis' remarkable knock of 100 off 58, which included 12 boundaries and five sixes.\n\nRuns\n\nMatch Stats\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-109 (Devon Conway - 10.2 ov), 2-114 (Aaron Hardie - 11.6 ov), 3-176 (Marcus Stoinis - 16.5 ov), 4-189 (Faf du Plessis - 18.3 ov), 5-193 (Calvin Savage - 19.1 ov\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets:\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nTravis Head\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nJustin Dill\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nAkeal Hosein\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nNaveen ul Haq\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Monday, July 8, 2024 20:30\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville\n\nToss: Washington Freedom elected to bowl",

Du Plessis delivered a stellar performance, scoring a brilliant century off 58 balls.\n\nHis innings were marked by aggressive and calculated shots, consistently punishing any loose deliveries from the Washington bowlers. Devon Conway provided crucial support, scoring 39 runs off 26 balls. Together, du Plessis and Conway built a solid 109-run partnership for the opening wicket.\n\nDespite dealing with an injured right hand, Marcus Stoinis contributed a vital 29 runs off 18 balls, further boosting the Texas Super Kings' total. However, Washington Freedom's bowling and fielding were below par, with several dropped catches and missed opportunities that allowed the Texas Super Kings to amass their substantial total.\n\nWhile the rain ultimately denied what could have been an exciting finish, both teams displayed promising performances. The Washington Freedom's explosive start in their chase and the Texas Super Kings' formidable batting display, particularly from Faf du Plessis, set a high standard for the rest of the season.\n\nBoth teams will look to build on these performances as the Major League Cricket season progresses, aiming to secure their positions in the tournament standings.",

But such was the spectacle in Major League Cricket when Andre Russell launched a colossal 107-meter six off Haris Rauf, leaving his teammates in awe.\n\n‌The San Francisco Unicorns clashed with the Los Angeles Knight Riders in their opening game in Dallas. Unicorns skipper Corey Anderson won the toss and chose to bowl first, a decision that initially proved effective as IPL MVP Sunil Narine was scalped by Haris Rauf in the second over. With Jason Roy and Unmukt Chand’s dismissal, the Knight Riders struggled at 46/3 after seven overs. However, a vital 45-run partnership between Shakib Al Hasan and Nitish Kumar took them to 88/3 by the 11th over. It was Andre Russell's explosive innings, featuring a colossal 107-meter six, that then further propelled the purple brigade to a solid 165/6 in 20 overs.\n\nThe West Indian powerhouse walked in to bat in the 13th over following Kumar's dismissal. Russell took some time to find his rhythm but began his onslaught from the 16th over onwards, saving the most spectacular moment for the 20th over. On the third ball of the final over, Rauf delivered a short-length ball angled into the stumps. Russell used his flawless judgment as he stood tall and unleashed a mighty pull shot. The timing was impeccable, and the sweet sound of the bat carried the ball out of the ground for a maximum. The shot travelled an astounding 351 feet, marking the longest six of the season. The Knight Riders' dugout, especially Shakib, was momentarily in disbelief at the incredible display.\n\nRussell-Mania at Dallas\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0",

    "body": "Global star Faf du Plessis lit up the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas with his magnificent century in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. Leading the Texas Super Kings (TSK) against the Washington Freedom (WF), Du Plessis dazzled with the bat, smashing a tremendous ton to announce his grand arrival in the US T20 tournament.\n\nStruggles in previous MLC season\n\nNotably, Du Plessis didn’t have a good time with the bat in MLC. He scored only 47 runs in the previous season of the exciting tournament and his start in the ongoing edition wasn’t promising either.. The right-handed batter managed just 14 runs in TSK’s opening game against the Los Angeles Knight Riders (LKR). Under significant pressure, Du Plessis needed to find his form, and he did so emphatically with a spectacular three-figure score.\n\nA tremendous century to mark his return\n\nDuring his stay in the middle, Du Plessis smashed 12 fours and five sixes to exhibit a batting brilliance. He was dismissed for exact 100 runs from 58 deliveries by Saurabh Netravalkar. Notably, on the last ball of the 18th over, Du Plessis reached the milestone by driving the slower leg-cutter pitched full outside off Lockie Ferguson for a boundary. Overall, it was his 6th hundred in the shortest format and the entire TSK dugout was up to applaud their captain’s knock.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Finn Allen slams Shakib Al Hasan for a hat-trick of sixes as SFU defeat LAKR in MLC 2024\n\nRain spoils the exciting match\n\nDriving on Du Plessis brilliant century, the Super Kings posted a massive total of 203/5 in 20 overs. However, his magical ton went in vain as the match ended without a result due to rain. Washington started their chase strongly, scoring 62 runs in just four overs with Travis Head (32 runs off 12 balls) and Steve Smith (26 runs off 13 balls) looking well set. Unfortunately, rain intervened after four overs, preventing the match from restarting. As a result, the game was cancelled, and both sides shared a point each.",

    "body": "In a thrilling match of the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024, the San Francisco Unicorns defeated the Los Angeles Knight Riders by six wickets at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday, July 8. The star of the show was New Zealand opener Finn Allen, who put on a spectacular display of power-hitting against the Knight Riders’ bowling attack.\n\nFinn Allen’s carnage against LAKR\n\nAllen smashed Shakib Al Hasan for three consecutive sixes in the fifth over, sending the ball deep into the stands. He continued his onslaught in the seventh over, hitting Andre Russell for two more maximums, taking his tally to five sixes across the two overs.\n\nHere’s the video\n\nAllen’s blistering knock of 63 off just 37 balls, at a strike rate of 170.27, laid the foundation for the Unicorns’ successful chase. He was ably supported by Matthew Short, who scored a quickfire 58 off 26 deliveries, as the pair added 116 runs for the second wicket.\n\nMatch summary\n\nThe Knight Riders, after being put in to bat first, posted a competitive total of 165/6 in their allotted 20 overs. Shakib (35) and Russell (40 off 25 balls) were the main contributors with the bat for the Knight Riders. For the Unicorns, Brody Couch and Haris Rauf picked up two wickets each, while Abrar Ahmad and Liam Plunkett chipped in with one apiece.\n\nIn response, the Unicorns got off to a flying start, thanks to the explosive batting of Allen and Short. Allen, in particular, was in a belligerent mood as he took on the Knight Riders’ bowlers, especially Shakib and Russell.\n\nThe Unicorns eventually reached their target in 15.2 overs, winning the match by six wickets. Spencer Johnson was the pick of the bowlers for the Knight Riders, finishing with figures of 3/30.\n\nAlso READ: Andre Russell smokes gigantic 107m six off Haris Rauf in SFU vs LAKR game\n\nWords from the match-winning duo\n\nSpeaking at the post-match presentation, a delighted Allen said, “It was a great team effort. The bowlers set it up nicely for us, and we just had to go out there and express ourselves. I’m glad I could contribute with the bat and help the team get over the line.”\n\nShort, who was named the Player of the Match, echoed Allen’s sentiments of the dressing room, saying, “We are joking in the change room as to who can hit the biggest sixes. I think the pitch got better to bat on under lights, probably dew played a part as well. This tournament has a lot of good players.”\n\nThe win puts the Unicorns in a strong position in the MLC 2024 standings, while the Knight Riders will look to bounce back in their next match. With players like Allen and Short in their ranks, the Unicorns will be a force to be reckoned with in the tournament.",

The all-rounder oozed his class with the bat and exhibited great power-hitting skills during the fag end of the innings.\n\nWith the Los Angeles Knight Riders struggling at 96/5, Andre Russell stepped up for his team and made sure that he bailed the team out of trouble. He counter-attacked the bowlers and brought his team back into the game with his powerful knock while batting against San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nOne of the highlights of Andre Russell's innings was the massive 107-meter that he hit against Haris Rauf. During the last over, the pacer bowled a short ball angling in, to which the batter lined it up and smashed it over wide long-on for a massive six.\n\nThe massive six by Andre Russell left the pacer Haris Rauf in shock as he didn't expect the batter to hit the six this far. Apart from the pacer, Los Angeles Knight Riders players in the dugout looked extremely jubilant as the ball went out of the ground for a massive six and the crowd at the stadium went berserk.\n\nHere's video of Andre Russel's massive six against Haris Rauf:\n\nAndre Russell ended with the innings of unbeaten 40 runs off 25 balls. He batted with a strike rate of 160 and also hit 2 fours and 3 sixes in his innings. His brutal innings in the end powered Los Angeles Knight Riders to a total of 165 runs, which at one moment seemed impossible.\n\nHowever, his effort went in vain as San Francisco Unicorns went on to win the game pretty easily.

Medium-pacer Justin Dill picked up 3/33 while Nicholas Pooran scored 44 from 30 balls for MI NY.\n\nIn response, Smith hit three sixes and four boundaries to top-score in the contest with an unbeaten 46 off just 28 balls. We moved to 55/1 in 7.4 overs before rain intervened with us being ahead of the par score of 51 as per the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern system, a method for calculating par scores and targets in rain-affected matches.\n\nBowling first, Marco Jansen struck for us as early as the third over with Dill also picking up a wicket in the powerplay. We managed to keep MI NY to 39/2 after the first six overs.\n\nGlenn Maxwell started his journey with us in the MLC with a wicket in his first over and Netravalkar provided a crucial breakthrough dismissing MI NY skipper Kieron Pollard with half the side back as the score read 91.\n\nThough Lockie Ferguson dismissed dangerman Pooran, MI NY bounced back with a quickfire 33-run partnership for the eighth wicket.

Chasing 155 runs, Washington already had 55 runs on board courtesy to captain Steve Smith’s blistering 46 (28) runs knock.\n\nBefore the play halted due to bad lighting, Smith’s side were four runs ahead and were awarded a win as per DLS method.\n\nWashington Freedom were calculative throughout the game. Saurabh Netravalkar and Justin Dill bowled beautifully to chip 3 wickets each. Despite Rashid Khan’s late onslaught, Washington restricted them to a decent total, and skipper Smith took care of the rest of the chase.\n\nHence, ahead of the game against Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom are expected to start as favourites.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nOn the other hand, the Texas Super Kings had a nightmarish start to the MLC 2024 season with a 12-run defeat against the Los Angeles Knight Riders. They bowled well to restrict Sunil Narine’s side to 162 runs.\n\nHowever, Super Kings failed to convert Devon Conway’s 53 (39) start to suffer an unnecessary collapse. Ali Khan took four wickets to grab the player of the match award.\n\nThat being said, to overpower Washington Freedom, the Super Kings have to take responsibility with the bat, especially captain Faf du Plessis Marcus Stoining and Aaron Hardie must play anchor roles, which will boost the confidence of the openers for the rest of the tournament.\n\nOther than that, Texas Super Kings is a well balanced side capable of making a long run into the tournament.\n\nWAS Vs TSK: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nWAS Vs TSK: Church Street Park Pitch Report\n\nChurch Street’s pitch has stayed even for both batters and bowlers so far in the tournament. With weather playing a big role, batting first and putting runs on the board is advisable. Seamers can make a huge impact given the favourable conditions.

He was the youngest player to be awarded the ICC Cricketer of the Year at the age of just 26. He also won the ICC Men’s Test Player of the Decade award from 2011-2020.\n\nSmith is the fastest Australian and sixth-fastest ever to reach 10000 runs in international cricket.

    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nThe first match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas features the hosts, who have the rarity of home advantage in Major League Cricket, the Texas Super Kings, taking on the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nDATE & TIME: Friday 5th July, 2024 - USA ET – 8:30pm / USA PT – 5:30pm / West Indies – 7:30pm & Saturday 6th July, 2024 - UK – 1:30am / South Africa – 2:30am / Pakistan – 5:30am / India – 6:00am / Bangladesh – 6:30am / Australia – 10:30am\n\nVENUE: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, Texas, United States\n\nWEATHER: 30c or 86 F with no rain expected\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: EXPLOITING HOME ADVANTAGE\n\nIn the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in 2023, the Texas Super Kings finished in the top two of a six-team table but they were eventually beaten in the Challenger by MI New York. However, with a very CSK-influenced leadership group of coach Stephen Fleming and captain Faf du Plessis are expected to come back with a bang in 2024.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: THE RECOVERY OF LAKR\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders endured a very difficult first ever season of Major League Cricket as they finished rock-bottom. They begun their season with four successive hammerings before a slender two-wicket defeat of eventual finalists and already league winners Seattle Orcas in their final game and there will need to be a real leap from LAKR this season.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLLL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Texas Super Kings will have the benefit of playing at probably the better of the two batting tracks in this tournament, at least that was the case in the ICC T20 World Cup, so there will be pressure on their top order. South Africa captain Aiden Markram didn’t have the best of World Cups with the bat but began to find some touch in the semi-final against Afghanistan and backing him to hit the ground running as TSK’s top batter in this match seems a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, TSK are set to try and damage teams with either smart change up bowling from Dwayne Bravo and Marcus Stoinis or spin with Noor Ahmad and Mitchell Santner. The best bet for them, though, to take two or more wickets in this match will be via their point of difference bowler, the excellent Naveen-ul-Haq.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nCaptained by Sunil Narine, LAKR perhaps lack a bit of depth and aggression in their batting lineup right at the top of the order but there is middle-order hitting with the likes of Shakib Al Hasan and Andre Russell. Their biggest threat, though, will be David Miller and, on what should and could be a good batting surface, backing a decent Miller score of 30+ runs seems a good bet.\n\nBowling-wise, LAKR do have the likes of Adam Zampa, Josh Little and Spencer Johnson to count on but good value could well be found in backing their domestic talents with both Ali Khan and Shadley van Schalkwyk involved. Ali Khan had a strong World Cup and backing him to take two or more of TSZ’s wickets may be worth a shot.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS VS LOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nWith just two venues in use during the 2024 Major League Cricket season, the Texas Super Kings will effectively be playing ‘home’ games at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas and whilst that seems like a nominal advantage in such a peculiar and short franchise tournament, that factor combined with their well rounded squad and LAKR’s lack of real star quality at the top with either bat or ball, as well as their failure last season, backing the Super Kings looks strong here.",
    "summary": "**Match Details**\n\n* The match is between the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders on Friday, July 5, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas, United States.\n* The weather is expected to be 30°C (86°F) with no rain.\n\n**Team Forms**\n\n* Texas Super Kings finished in the top two in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in 2023 but lost in the Challenger.\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders finished at the bottom of the table in the inaugural season.\n\n**Betting Analysis**\n\n* Texas Super Kings have a well-rounded squad and are expected to perform well at their home ground.\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders lack star quality at the top of their batting order.\n* Good betting options include Aiden Markram to score well for Texas Super Kings, Naveen-ul-Haq to take two or more wickets, and David Miller to score 30+ runs for Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n**Expert Prediction**\n\n* Backing the Texas Super Kings to win the match is a strong prediction due to their home advantage, well-rounded squad, and Los Angeles Knight Riders' lack of star quality and poor performance in the previous season.",

    "date": "Thu Jul  4 08:40:12 2024",
    "body": "After a successful inaugural season in 2023, Major League Cricket (MLC) is all set to start the second season in 2024 which will commence from July 5 to July 28.\n\nUnlike the first season's 15 league games, this season will have 21 matches in the first round of the tournament followed by four playoff games.\n\nIn the opener of the season, on the 5th of July, the defending champions MI New York, led by Kieron Pollard will take on last year's runner-ups, Seattle Orcas, led by Wayne Parnell in Church Street Park, Morrisville at 01.00 hours (IST).\n\nLater on the same day, Faf du Plesiss' Texas Super Kings will face Sunil Narine-led Los Angeles Knight Riders in Grand Prairie, Dallas at 06.00 hours (IST). Dallas' Grand Prairie stadium will host all four playoff games from July 25 to July 29.\n\nIn the inaugural season of MLC in 2023, MI New York's Nicholas Pooran top scored in the tournament with 388 runs in 8 innings followed by his IPL teammate Quinton de Kock at 264 in 7 innings. Pooran was also adjudged as the Player of The Tournament.\n\nTrent Boult, MI New York's lead pacer was the highest wicket-taker of the season with 22 wickets in 8 games followed by the Aussie duo of Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye at joint-second with 11 wickets each.\n\nBalanced San Francisco Unicorns aim for the finish line.\n\nCaptain: Corey Anderson\n\nCoach: Shane Watson\n\nHow did they fare last season: Group Stage\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns wrapped up their chequered campaign after snatching defeat from a winning position in their final group stage game against the Texas Super Kings. Reeling at 92 for 5 in the 14th over, TSK romped home with 5 balls to spare as Milind Kumar and Daniel Sams dashed the Unicorns hopes in a matter of minutes. Unicorns kicked off life at MLC in spectacular fashion against the might of MI New York, beating a much fancied opposition by 22 runs. The game also dragged Corey Anderson from cricketing oblivion after a dazzling knock of 91 off 52 deliveries. Anderson closed out the tournament as the Unicorns' highest run getter with 190 runs in 5 games.\n\nUnicorns drafted in old war horse Liam Plunkett as the primary pick for $70,000 in the draft last year. The 39 year old was worth his weight in gold, overshadowing the younger brigade of Carmi Le Roux and Haris Rauf in terms of wickets and ECON. The tournament also proved to be a nightmare for captain Aaron Finch at the sunset of his career, labouring to 68 runs and striking at a dismal 88. Unicorns stop-start campaign embodied the returns of their international stars including the likes of Marcus Stoinis and Finn Allen who failed to muster a single score of over 40 runs in 5 innings.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nThe Unicorns made some sweeping changes to their international rosters. The franchise will pin high hopes on their bumper signing of Pat Cummins. There would have been a temptation to parachute in Cummins as the captain following the leadership vacuum with the retirement of Aaron Finch but the Unicorns management bestowed the captaincy to Anderson keeping in mind his local wherewithals. World cricket's latest sensation Jake Fraser McGurk would hope to carry where he left off from the IPL where he scored 330 runs striking at 234.04 while Kiwi, Finn Allen manages to retain his spot after a pedestrian season with the bat. Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford have been entrusted to add the muscle in the middle order while fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Matt Henry will find themselves at the core of the Unicorns bowling attack.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\nThe Unicorns went all out to grab former Pakistan U19 captain Hassan Khan at the MLC domestic draft this year. Khan bagged a top drawer $75,000 contract for putting on a splendid all round show in last year's Minor League Cricket tournament, amassing 220 runs in 5 innings at a S/R of 181 to go with his tally of 11 wickets at an ECON of under 5. Khan will form a troika with left arm spinning all rounders Sanjay Krishnamurthy and Karima Gore. Former West Indies wicket-keeper Jahmar Hamilton has finally been rewarded for his stellar show in the Minor League season after season. Liam Plunkett comes back for yet another MLC season in what may finally be his swansong from the sport while Carmi Le Roux has been retained to form the only left hand seaming option for the Unicorns.\n\nProbable XI : Jake Fraser McGurk, Finn Allen, Josh Inglis, Corey Anderson, Sherfane Rutherford, Tajinder Singh, Hassan Khan, Liam Plunkett, Pat Cummins, Haris Rauf, Carmi Le Roux\n\nSeattle Orcas: De Kock, Klaasen key for glory.\n\nCaptain: Wayne Parnell\n\nCoach: Pravin Amre\n\nHow did they fare last season: Runners Up\n\nSeattle Orcas stormed into the finals last year, dropping only a solitary league game in their march to the final. The Orcas were besieged at the final frontier by a whirlwind Nicholas Pooran century that counterpunched Quinton de Kock's swashbuckling 87. Orcas played some phenomenal cricket throughout the tournament on the back of some brilliant individual performances. Heinrich Klaasen's devastating knock of 110* off 44 deliveries sealed a final over thriller against a packed MI New York bowling lineup. His unravelling of Rashid Khan for a 26-run over is seen as a major inflexion point in his career.\n\nImad Wasim spun a web around the rest of the teams throughout the tournament. Bringing all his experience into play to bowl the tough powerplay overs, coming out unscathed with an economy of 6.33 and a total tally of 10 wickets in 7 games. USA World Cup star Harmeet Singh proved to be a crucial understudy to Imad as the duo fed off each other to wear down the opposition. De Kock kicked on with three half-centuries in the latter half of the tournament to top the batting charts after an indifferent start to the tournament.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nThe Orcas opted for a major overhaul to their international roster. With Dasun Shanaka, Dwayne Pretorius and Shimron Hetmyer being seen as surplus to requirements, the franchise looked to fill in obvious gaps in their roster. Pakistan death bowling specialist Zaman Khan and Proteas' new pace sensation are a couple of key signings for the Orcas this year to aid captain Wayne Parnell at the fag end of an innings. Ryan Rickleton joins De Kock and Klaasen in an already South Africa-heavy set-up. Orcas also bring in some Kiwi flavour with off-spinning allrounder Michael Bracewell in their bowling mix in addition to Imad Wasim.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\nOrcas find themselves rich in all-round talent with Shubham Ranjane, Harmeet Singh and Hamad Azam in their ranks. Ranjane proved to be a handful with his electric fielding, his array of slower balls and valuable cameos lower down the order in the inaugural season. Nauman Anwar and Shehan Jayasuriya bring in the international pedigree to their batting lineup. Anwar especially was seen to play the perfect foil for De Kock at the top of the order with some understated knocks. Cameron Gannon, an American-born Aussie state cricketer provides further depth to the Orcas pace battery. The Orcas drafted back USA vice-captain Aaron Jones in a supplemental draft in the wake of his monumental 94* in the World Cup opener.\n\nProbable XI: Quinton De Kock, Nauman Anwar, Shehan Jayasuriya, Heinrich Klaasen, Ryan Rickleton, Imad Wasim, Harmeet Singh, Shubham Ranjane, Zaman Khan, Wayne Parnell, Cameron Gannon\n\nTexas Super Kings: Star batters to backup unheralded bowlers\n\nTexas\n\nCaptain:Faf Du Plesis\n\nCoach: Stephen Fleming\n\nHow did they fare last season: Knockouts\n\nThe crowd frenzy that surrounded the Texas Super Kings in Dallas invoked a strong feeling of deja vu amongst the Super Kings fans. This unwavering support laid the first bricks to build yet another hollowed fortress 5,000 miles away from their spiritual home in Chennai. TSK kicked off their campaign last year with a thumping home win against a star studded LA Knight Riders. Devon Conway and David Miller chipped in with sparkling half centuries on that day but mostly struggled thereafter to match their opening salvo. To compound their batting woes captain Faf Du Plessis failed to cross 14 runs in any of his 7 innings while Milind Kumar was the lone half centurion among the domestics.\n\nFormer Peshawar Zalmi leg spinner Mohammad Mohsin proved to be the domestic find of the season for TSK. Mohsin started off with a bang, bamboozling the LAKR with a spell of 4 for 8 on the opening night. He further made heads turn with back to back strikes at a pivotal point in a low scorer against eventual champions MI New York, including pinning Keiron Pollard dead in front on the first ball. Dwayne Bravo turned the clock back with a ballistic 76 off 39 deliveries in their second game against Washington Freedom at the age of 39 but his body failed to last the tournament which in a way derailed the balance of the team and therefore the hopes of clinching the title for TSK.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nMatheesha Pathirana's unavailability had Stephen Fleming make an SOS call to Bravo. The 40 year old Super Kings loyalist will partner with Afghanistan's Naveen-ul-Haq to shoulder death over responsibilities for TSK. Du Plessis, who will turn 40 half way into the tournament, will take over the reins for yet another season. Aiden Markram, meanwhile, will have little time to shake off the world cup heartbreak as the South African captain is expected to line up for the opening game on July 5. The tournament also provides an excellent opportunity for Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner to find their form after missing out in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Conway would particularly be itching to go after being sidelined from the IPL owing to a fractured thumb. Marcus Stoinis will don the yellow this year after a stint with the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural season along with fellow Western Australian, Aaron Hardie.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\nMilind Kumar is expected to be the key middle order lynchpin for TSK with his experience. TSK have entrusted 18 year old South African born wicket keeper batsman Joshua Tromp as their first pick in this year's domestic draft. TSK's second draft pick, little known left arm spinner Raj Nannan hailing from Guyana surprised many in the American cricket circles. Nannan will form a spin troika with leggies Mohammad Mohsin and Zia Shehzad. Rusty Theron's retirement leaves the weight of the fast bowling mantle on the USA domestic trio of Cameron Stevenson, Calvin Savage and Zia Ul-Haq.\n\nProbable XI: Faf Du Plessis, Devon Conway, Milind Kumar, Aiden Markram, Marcus Stoinis, Joshua Tromp, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Stevenson, Naveen Ul Haq, Mohammad Mohsin, Raj Nannan\n\nBrute power, rounded bowling attack provides MI New York impetus to reclaim glory\n\nCaptain: Kieron Pollard\n\nCoach: Robin Peterson\n\nHow did they fare last season: Champions\n\nMI New York's stop start campaign peaked at the right juncture after failing to sustain winning momentum in the league stage. Kieron Pollard's unfortunate shoulder injury in the final league game paved the way for Nicholas Pooran to steward a rocky MINY ship. After securing the 4th spot by a hair's breadth, MINY gathered steam in the knockouts. Pooran's men came back from behind to stitch a 3 match winning streak with the captain capping off their historic run with an innings for the ages, a cracking of 137* off 55 deliveries in the grand finale.\n\nPooran's form remained red hot throughout the tournament, striking at 167 for his 388 runs. Tim David matched him stroke for stroke scoring at a similar clip, ending with 209 runs in his limited opportunities lower down the order. Left arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige proved to be the ultimate domestic find of the season for MINY. A nagging left arm spinner and a livewire on the field, Kenjige showed heart to bowl the tough overs in the powerplay with aplomb. Up against some superstars of T20 cricket, little known Kenjige topped the economy charts for the tournament, going at a mere 5.73 RPO in his first taste of top flight cricket.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nMINY have largely called upon their core group of players that have served them elsewhere under the MI banner. MI talisman Kieron Pollard will pull up his socks yet again for a franchise he has served for more than 14 seasons. Tim David and Nicholas Pooran will be back in MI colours looking to emulate their inaugural season heroics. South African youngster Dewald Brewis has been afforded yet another chance to find a breakthrough T20 season. They have also roped in West Indies all-rounder Romario Shepherd to add to their middle order muscle who is also an adequate backup for their jacked up pace attack in Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult and Anrich Nortje. MINY also have successfully retained Rashid Khan to form one of the most complete bowling attacks going around in the tournament.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\n37 year old former Gujarat leg spinning all-rounder Sunny Patel makes a surprise comeback to professional cricket after his move to USA. USA captain Monank Patel is expected to be back at the top of the order after being sidelined by a shoulder injury during the world cup. Steven Taylor finds himself under the injury cloud after choosing to play with a shoulder niggle. Opener Shayan Jahangir will look to further capitalise on some solid starts he had provided in the first edition for the team. MINY would hope former Pakistani pacer Ehsan Adil brings in the required depth in the pace battery to step in the role as a container in the presence of a very strong international pace attack. American born and South African raised left handed opening batsman Ruben Clinton has been rewarded with a contract for his exploits in the minor league.\n\nProbable XI: Monank Patel, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard, Tim David, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult, Nosthush Kenjige, Ehsan Adil.",
    "summary": "**Tournament Schedule**: The second season of MLC will take place from July 5 to July 28, 2024, with 21 matches in the first round followed by four playoff games.\n\n**Opening Match**: The defending champions MI New York, led by Kieron Pollard, will face Seattle Orcas, led by Wayne Parnell, in the opening match on July 5 at Church Street Park, Morrisville.\n\n**Team Updates**:\n\n* San Francisco Unicorns: Have made some changes to their international roster, including the addition of Pat Cummins and Jake Fraser McGurk. They will be led by Corey Anderson.\n* Seattle Orcas: Have overhauled their international roster, including the additions of Pakistan death bowling specialist Zaman Khan and Proteas' new pace sensation. They will be led by Wayne Parnell.\n* Texas Super Kings: Have retained Faf du Plessis as their captain and have added Aiden Markram, Devon Conway, and Mitchell Santner to their international roster.\n* MI New York: Have largely retained their core group of players, including Kieron Pollard, Tim David, and Nicholas Pooran.\n\n**Notable Players**:\n\n* Nicholas Pooran (MI New York) was the top scorer in the inaugural season with 388 runs in 8 innings.\n* Trent Boult (MI New York) was the highest wicket-taker in the inaugural season with 22 wickets in 8 games.\n\nI hope this summary provides a helpful overview of the article!",

Oh, and it’s been some revolution this! From introducing the game to ordinary Americans to becoming a raging success, Major League Cricket is all set to push the boundaries further in 2024. IT’S ONE DAY AWAY. Okay, you’ve got questions? We hear you? Here’s your cheat sheet to everything you need to know..\n\nAnother cricket party? No wait, didn’t the World Cup just get over?\n\nThe World Cup was just the start, the MLC will now take it to the crescendo! The second season is here – six iconic cities, two venues, 23 days, and MI New York out there to defend their crown. A host of world class cricketers have assembled in town, and are all set to inspire another whole generation of young American fans.\n\nSo who’s playing? What’s the format?\n\nThere’s the defending champions, MI New York, the runner’s up, Seattle Orcas, Faf du Plessis-led Texas Super Kings, fresh from winning the IPL, Sunil Narine-led LA Knight Riders, fresh from inducting Pat Cummins, San Francisco Unicorns, and the Washington Freedom.\n\nEach team would play seven league games, and the top four will then proceed to the playoffs. The first leg of the tournament would take place at Church Street Park in Morrisville, before he caravan moved to the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nCould you recap season one please?\n\nSo we won. It was a tight road until the final though, with MI New York having to win their last four games to win the title. And they did it in style, with Trent Boult getting four-fer after four-fer, young Dewald Brevis playing some clutch knocks in the middle-order, Tim David finishing games for fun like only he can, and Monank Patel getting us off to fliers. Come the final, against Seattle Orcas, it was the Nicholas Pooran show, with a blazing 137-run-knock to give us our moment of history!\n\nWoah, Defending Champs! What’s new this time then?\n\nAnrich Nortje, with his 150kph thunderbolts, is all set to don the Blue and Gold, and it is going to be a dream to watch him bowl in tandem with Trent Boult and Kagiso Rabada. Also Romario Shepherd, fresh from his assault in the IPL for Mumbai Indians and then in the T20 World Cup for West Indies, is here too. Four other youngsters, Rushil Ugarkar, Heath Richards, Ruben Clinton and Sunny Patel have come into the mix as well. But the core of the team remains the same, with Kieron Pollard, the MI #OneFamily legend, along with Nicholas Pooran, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Tim David and the USA star players like Steven Taylor, Monank Patel and Shayan Jahangir.\n\nAnd what’s new with the MLC in 2024?\n\nA few extra matches. Last year saw each team play a single round-robin, but this time there are two extra games in the league. It’s just gotten bigger. But should remain the same though is the passion the league generated among the supporters, who thronged to the stadium in large numbers.\n\nOkay, I’m already excited..what’s the schedule?\n\nJuly 5, 3:30pm EDT (July 6, 1am IST) - MI New York vs Seattle Orcas\n\nJuly 6, 3pm EDT (July 7, 12:30am IST) - Washington Freedom vs MI New York\n\nJuly 12, 3pm EDT (July 13, 12:30am IST) - MI New York vs Texas Super Kings\n\nJuly 14, 7:30pm CDT (July 15, 6am IST) - Texas Super Kings vs MI New York\n\nJuly 16, 7:30pm CDT (July 17, 6am IST) - MI New York vs Washington Freedom\n\nJuly 18, 7:30pm CDT (July 19, 6am IST) - MI New York vs San Francisco Unicorns\n\nJuly 21, 7:30pm CDT (July 22, 6am IST) - LA Knight Riders vs MI New York",

With some new recruits onboard and as a much stronger-looking outfit, WAF will look to better their performance and eventually lift their maiden MLC title.\n\nHere is a look at the Washington Freedom squad for the MLC 2024.\n\nBatters: Steven Smith, Akhilesh Reddy, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed\n\nAll-rounders: Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra\n\nBowlers: Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nStrength of Washington Freedom for MLC 2024\n\nVariety and depth in the overseas recruits\n\nThe Washington Freedom have recruited some high-quality overseas players ahead of the MLC 2024 season. These recruits will give them strength ahead of the season alongwith variety and flexibility to field teams based on the strength of the opposition and the playing conditions.\n\nWhile Steven Smith, Travis Head and Rachin Ravindra will add stability to the top order, Glenn Maxwell, alongside Andries Gous, will give them the firepower in the middle order.\n\nIn the bowling department, they will have Akeal Hosein in the spin department, with Lockie Ferguson, Andre Tye and Marco Jansen rounding up in the pace front. An overall look gives us the idea that they have plenty of resources to use as per the playing conditions, and they go with a 'horses for courses' policy.\n\nWeaknesses of Washington Freedom for MLC 2024\n\nLack of experience in the spin department\n\nAkeal Hosein will be in charge of the team's spin department. Besides leading this aspect of the team, he will have the majority of the task of controlling the opposition in the middle overs and picking up wickets. There is a lack of experienced spinners in the squad, and the skipper will have to turn to Glenn Maxwell and even Rachin Ravindra to get some efficient overs in the middle overs.\n\nOver-dependency on Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell for power hitting\n\nMost of the batters in the Washington Freedom look like grafters. They will take time to settle down before shifting gears. Thus the Freedom will have an over-dependency on Travis Head at the top and Glenn Maxwell in the middle order to increase the team's scoring rate.\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted XI for the first match",

The Kieron Pollard-led side had a very rough time in the league stage of last year but they changed things quickly, dominating the latter half of the tournament.\n\nThey have some of the fiercest strikers of the ball in Nicholas Pooran, Tim David and Steven Taylor while among bowlers, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada can dominate any attack.\n\nWhen it comes to Seattle, their bowling unit is a bit concerning. Zaman Khan and Nandre Burger are two exciting options but it may prove difficult for them to stop New York’s juggernaut. Among batters, Aaron Jones, Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen will be extremely vital. Pakistan’s Imad Wasim can be crucial on the slow pitches of the US too.\n\nMatch Details\n\nChurch Street Park Pitch Report:\n\nIt’s a decent track. Bowling first will help and anything over 175 runs will be a good score on the surface.\n\nNY vs SEA Head-to-Head Record\n\nNY vs SEA Probable Playing XIs\n\nMI New York:\n\nSteven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Monank Patel (wk) Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard (c), Tim David, Dewald Brewis, Rashid Khan, Romario Shepherd, Trent Boult, Ehsan Adil,\n\nSeattle Orcas:\n\nQuinton de Kock (wk), Nauman Anwar, Shehan Jayasuriya, Heinrich Klaasen, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Wasim, Michael Bracewell, Wayne Parnell (c), Harmeet Singh, Obed McCoy, Cameron Gannon\n\nNY vs SEA Probable Best Players of the Match\n\nProbable Best Batter:\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nWest Indies international Nicholas Pooran was sensational in the recently concluded T20 World Cup. Lately, he has been terrific in the shortest of the game and is difficult to stop when he is in the zone. Against a moderate bowling unit of Seattle, Pooran can wreak havoc.\n\nProbable Best Bowler:\n\nRashid Khan\n\nLike Pooran, Rashid was incredible in the T20 World Cup. He was one of the forces to reckon with, with the ball for Afghanistan and given his form, the spinner can prove to be dangerous.\n\nToday’s Match Prediction: MI New York to win the match\n\nScenario 1\n\nMI New York win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 40-50\n\nSEA: 155-175\n\nMI New York win the match\n\nScenario 2\n\nSeattle Orcas win the toss and opt to bowl.\n\nPowerplay: 35-45\n\nNY: 175-195\n\nMI New York win the match",

Seattle Orcas, on the other hand, have a concerning bowling unit, but their batting lineup includes Aaron Jones, Quinton de Kock, and Heinrich Klaasen, with Imad Wasim being a key player on slow US pitches.\n\n**Pitch Report and Head-to-Head Record**: The Church Street Park pitch is decent, and bowling first will be advantageous. A score of over 175 runs is expected to be competitive. MI New York and Seattle Orcas have not played each other before, making this a maiden encounter.\n\n**Probable Playing XIs and Match Prediction**: The probable playing XIs for both teams are mentioned in the article.

Born in India, he represented the country in the Under-19 World Cup and shared the field with players like Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh.\n\nAfter moving to the USA for his studies, Netravalkar balanced his career as a software developer and a cricketer. His recent performances in the T20 World Cup 2024 and Major League Cricket 2024 have been remarkable that has earned him widespread praise.\n\nBET NOW: Exclusive sign-up offers and bonuses when you bet on sporting action\n\nIn a recent interview, Saurabh Netravalkar expressed his desire to play in the IPL 2025.\n\nWhat did Saurabh Netravalkar say on playing IPL 2025?\n\nBefore the T20 World Cup 2024, Netravalkar had said that USA is his karmabhumi (land of work), while India is his janmabhumi (motherland). He has done quite a lot for his land of work, so when asked about his interest in playing for his motherland, India, in the prestigious league, Netravalkar replied:\n\n\"I mean, that is not in my hands. If the selection happens, it happens. I will try and let's see.\"\n\nHow did Netravalkar perform in T20 World Cup 2024?\n\nNetravalkar has been instrumental in the USA's surprising run in the T20 World Cup. The USA defeated Canada and Pakistan in the group stages. He contributed in restricting Pakistan to 159/7 by taking 2 wickets for just 18 runs in 4 overs and bowled a match-winning super over.\n\nMore: Did Rohit Sharma photoshop training picture to show a fitter body? Fans go crazy over Sri Lanka training image\n\nHow did Netravalkar perform in Major League Cricket 2024?\n\nIn addition to his World Cup heroics, Netravalkar shined in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. He was the top wicket-taker with 15 wickets in 7 games. His team, Washington Freedom, won the title, which added to his growing reputation.\n\nAndy Flower, former Zimbabwe player and current Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) head coach, who worked with Netravalkar in the ILT20 league, praised his skills and professionalism. He sees Netravalkar as a left-arm swing bowler who excels in death overs.\n\n\"His stocks have flown off the roof. Very skillful and a great man around the team. People will be looking and thinking, that's a left-arm swing bowler who can also bowl for us at the death,\" Flower told ESPN Cricinfo.\n\nWhen is the IPL Mega Auction?\n\nThe dates for IPL 2025 mega auction haven’t been made official yet but like the previous auctions, it's highly likely that the mega auction will be conducted in December 2024 or February 2025.\n\nWhen does IPL 2025 start?\n\nIPL 2025 is likely to start from March 23, 2025 up until May 29, 2025. The dates haven't been made official by the BCCI yet and might change in due course of time.\n\nWith his impressive record, Netravalkar could be a sought-after player in the auction. As he sets his sights on the IPL 2025, fans and cricket experts alike will be watching closely to see if he can make a mark in one of the world's most prestigious cricket leagues.",

    "body": "Emerging Cricket takes a look at the domestic contributors for MLC finalists San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom ahead of Sunday’s MLC Final. The Bart King award will likely come down to SF’s Hassan Khan and Washington’s Saurabh Netravalkar. It’s all up for grabs on Sunday in Grand Prairie.\n\nWashington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns made waves in the lead up to the 2024 Major League Cricket season with big name overseas signings. For the Freedom, it was the addition of Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head. For the Unicorns, it was Pat Cummins and young phenom Jake Fraser-McGurk. But an injection of Australian cricket royalty isn’t enough on its own to carry a team to the league final, no matter how potent the dose.\n\nWith the requirement of five domestics in every playing eleven, teams need to find the right mix to supplement their well known international stars to go deep in a longer tournament than the inaugural edition. And to those who follow American domestic cricket closely, it should come as no surprise that San Francisco and Washington are meeting in the final.\n\nSunday’s final might also determine more than just the 2024 MLC Champions. The favorites for the Bart King Domestic Player of the Tournament Award are Washington’s Saurabh Netravalkar and San Francisco’s Hassan Khan. In 2023, the award went to Seattle Orcas bowler Cameron Gannon, a consolation prize for falling to MI New York in the championship game. This year the prize will likely go to whomever makes a bigger mark in Sunday’s final.\n\nDomestic Bowlers set the table for Washington’s overseas batting power\n\nWashington’s Saurabh Netravalkar, the left handed Oracle developer who stole hearts and inspired memes during the T20 World Cup, is the current league leader in wickets with 14. This in spite of missing two games to attend the birth of his first child. Tack that on to his ten wickets from six games in 2023, including the tournament’s best ever figures of six wickets for nine runs, and Washington have perhaps the most valuable domestic player across the league’s first two seasons.\n\nAlong with Netravalkar, Washington returned three other regular domestic starters from 2023 in Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed and Andries Gous, fresh from impressing at the World Cup with Saurabh.\n\nWith the bat, the Freedom have benefited heavily from the good form of their overseas stars. Travis Head currently sits at second in the league with 327 runs for the season, at an average of 54.50 and strike rate of 173.93 and five half centuries in only eight games. Head also tops the leaderboards for both fours (43) and sixes (23). Captain Steve Smith sits only two places behind Head in the league run rankings with 248 at an average of 49.60 and a strike rate of 142.52 and two fifties.\n\nWashington’s batting has been so reliable, in fact, that they’ve only had eight different batters take strike this season, and only four with more than four innings. Eight half centuries from overseas batters have surely limited chances for middle order domestic batters like Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed and Lahiru Milantha.\n\nFrom the domestic batters, Andries Gous has enjoyed consistent chances in the top order, batting six times out of seven games played, also missing a game for the birth of a child. While Gous displayed the ability to change gears in the World Cup, he’s played more of a supporting role with the Freedom this season, often conceding strike to a hot partner while staying alive in the middle for an average of 44 and strike rate of 115.78, not out three times.\n\nWashington domestic batters do what’s needed\n\nIn all, Washington domestics faced 211 balls (29.84% of the team’s total) and scored 253 of the team’s 1029 batted runs (24.59%). The low strike rate can be attributed to the support role of Gous at the top, and to a match saving 63 run partnership between Pienaar and Milantha against Seattle that began after the first ball of the tenth over with Washington at 64 runs for five wickets chasing 124, ending triumphantly after the second ball of the 19th over. In short, Washington domestic batters have gotten the job done when needed, reflected in their collective batting average of 63.25.\n\nThose sizing up the Freedom roster could see that the team would lean heavily on domestic bowling. Netravalkar, Justin Dill and Akhilesh Bodugum were retained, while Ian Holland, Amilla Aponso and U23 Yasir Mohammad were acquired in the 2024 domestic draft. The variety and depth was obvious and high volume was a certainty, but the question would be what combination of fast and spin bowling would Washington utilize?\n\nFive different domestics have bowled for Washington, accounting for 47.5% of the team’s volume, led by Netravalkar’s 22.2 overs. As a team, Washington’s bowling economy is a glorious 7.746, and they take a wicket every 19.26 runs. Domestics have taken 35 out of the team’s 58 wickets (60.34%) at an average of only 15.37, while going only slightly more expensive (7.864 economy) than their overseas teammates (7.649 economy).\n\nNext man up: Depth matters\n\nJessy Singh, released by New York following a 2023 season in which he bowled in just one game, found himself without a team after March’s 2024 MLC domestic draft. Just a few months later, Jessy appeared in five games for USA in the T20 World Cup. Though he claimed the wicket of Babar Azam in USA’s famous upset victory over Pakistan, the remainder of the tournament came with mixed performances. The supplemental draft came and went with Jessy again unselected.\n\nJessy kept in game condition by bowling in the nets for MI New York until Washington added him to the roster in Netravalkar’s absence. He was put straight into the eleven and rewarded the Freedom with two MVP efforts in two games, giving the team three such performances from domestics this season.\n\n“None of these guys have seen me in person, it speaks highly about them. They backed me to be in the eleven today, which I wasn’t expecting,” Jessy said in a Washington Freedom social media video following his Freedom debut. “It never felt like it’s my first game with the franchise, just coming in.”\n\nBalance is key for San Francisco\n\nFor San Francisco, domestic balance has been found throughout both the batting order and bowling attack. Quite literally.\n\nHassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam PLunkett, Carmi Le Roux, Juanoy Drysdale, Tajinder Singh and captain Corey Anderson have combined for 72 of the Unicorns 143.5 overs this season. Their domestic corps has taken 28 of 38 wickets and outperforms overseas bowlers in economy, 8.319 to 8.812, averaging only 21.39 runs per wicket compared to a whopping 63.30 from overseas bowlers.\n\nWhile Hassan Khan has been the clear star, taking 9 wickets at an economy of 6.33 in 18 overs and scoring 191 runs at a strike rate of 140.44 and average of 47.75, Corey Anderson has provided the Unicorns with yet another domestic all round performer. While he’s done a bit less with the bat than you’d expect (111 runs at 127.58 SR and 27.75 average), Corey has utilized his left arm to fill gaps in the overs to the tune of 8.1 overs at 8.69 with four wickets. Corey also took one of the best catches you’ll ever see against TSK on Friday night.\n\nBut it’s Corey’s captaincy and familiarity with the domestic players that really makes him stand out. Juanoy Drysdale attributed his early comfort coming into the team in part to Corey’s “calm, cool and collected personality.”\n\nDepth matters, part two\n\nIn just three games, Drysdale has given San Francisco their very own Jessy Singh.\n\nWhen Liam Plunkett was ruled out with an injury after playing in four games, the Unicorns had a roster spot to fill. Drysdale had been named as a reserve for USA Cricket during the World Cup, but never got called up to appear in a game. Like Jessy, Juanoy was passed up in the MLC domestic draft and again in the supplemental draft.\n\nHoning his craft with The Philadelphians of Minor League Cricket, Drysdale had another familiar face to ease him into the squad. “Playing with Liam Plunkett as a coach and mentor in the minor league has been incredibly beneficial,” Drysdale told Emerging Cricket. “I’ve learned a lot from him, especially about being a Pro Athlete. His guidance has played a crucial role in preparing me for the MLC. Happy to be here!”\n\nAnd after Friday’s win to advance to the MLC Final, the Unicorns must be happy to have him. With San Francisco defending 200 runs against the potent Texas Super Kings in front of a big Super Kings home crowd, Juanoy struck in the 8th over to get Aaron Hardle while the home team was cruising at 84 for the loss of just one. In his very next over, the tenth of the Super Kings innings, Juanoy struck again, claiming Marcus Stoinis for just one run.\n\nBrody Couch and Carmi le Roux have also expressed great talent, combining for eight wickets in eight innings between them, while Plunkett took five wickets before bowing out of the tournament. These performances from domestic fast bowlers were crucial considering the underwhelming output from Pat Cummings so far, who has struck only twice in 19 overs.\n\nDomestic batting: MLC’s true unicorn\n\nBut unlike the Freedom, the Unicorns have had to rely regularly on their domestic batters to get to this point. Particularly in the middle order. Facing 358 (42.27%) of 847 deliveries this season, and striking at 129.60, San Francisco’s domestic batters have pulled their weight.\n\nAlong with Khan and Anderson, 21 year old Bay Area resident Sanjay Krishnamurthi has been a major bright spot for the team. After appearing in zero games in 2023, the Unicorns retained Sanjay as their U23 and spoke highly of his talent and potential. Unicorns leadership have put their money where their mouth is in 2024, playing Sanjay in all eight games. The young gun’s performance on Monday Night against this Freedom squad was the best from a domestic batter this season.\n\nWith San Francisco chasing 174 in a game shortened to 14 overs by rain, star batter Finn Allen got out on the very first ball. Sanjay and Jake Fraser-McGurk would team up for 45 runs before the young Aussie edged Andrew Tye straight back to Gous in the fifth over. Sanjay tacked on another 77 with Josh Inglis (45 from 17) in a hurry and everything was looking sparkly for the Unicorns until Tye struck again, taking both Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford in the 10th over.\n\nHassan Khan (32 from 11) would help Sanjay take it home with two balls to spare, and the Unicorns would hand the Freedom their first loss of the season. Sanjay’s brave innings, highlighted by a memorable one handed six over third man against Netravalkar, would end with the Unicorns over the line, not out after scoring 79 from 42 with a half dozen sixes.\n\nFriday’s Qualifier was a rematch, and Washington had their revenge, holding San Francisco to just 145 runs and chasing it down with 27 balls in hand. Sunday’s final will be the tiebreaker for the season, and it will likely determine the Bart King award winner.\n\nThese are two teams with so much in common and so much to prove. Two teams not affiliated with IPL franchises. Two teams that bat a domestic at number three. Two teams that have featured domestic fast bowling replacements who have had big moments in big wins. Two teams that have awarded game MVP to domestics three times each. Two teams that have had to build their brand from scratch. Considering the nature of the contests so far between these two teams, we might have MLC’s first truly organic rivalry.\n\nYou’re reading Emerging Cricket — brought to you by a passionate group of volunteers with a vision for cricket to be a truly global sport, and a mission to inspire passion to grow the game.\n\nBe sure to check out our homepage for all the latest news, please subscribe for regular updates, and follow EC on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube.",

The match will not only determine the champions but also likely decide the winner of the Bart King Domestic Player of the Tournament Award.\n\n**Domestic Contributors**\n\nBoth teams have relied heavily on their domestic players to reach the final. Washington's Saurabh Netravalkar is the current league leader in wickets with 14, while San Francisco's Hassan Khan has been the star performer with 9 wickets and 191 runs.\n\n**Washington Freedom's Domestic Strength**\n\nWashington's domestic bowlers have set the table for their overseas batting power, with Netravalkar, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, and Andries Gous being regular starters. Andries Gous has been consistent in the top order, while middle-order domestic batters like Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, and Lahiru Milantha have made valuable contributions.\n\n**San Francisco Unicorns' Balanced Attack**\n\nSan Francisco has found balance throughout both their batting order and bowling attack. Hassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam Plunkett, Carmi Le Roux, Juanoy Drysdale, Tajinder Singh, and captain Corey Anderson have all contributed to their success. The Unicorns have had to rely regularly on their domestic batters, particularly in the middle order, with Sanjay Krishnamurthi being a major bright spot.\n\n**Bart King Award**\n\nThe Bart King Award is likely to go to either Saurabh Netravalkar or Hassan Khan, depending on their performances in the final match.",

Even though MyKhel.com could not verify if the Australian star was earlier following the franchise, several fans and RCB fan handles made the claim on X.\n\nNotably, the much-awaited meeting of the IPL owners with the BCCI is also scheduled to be held on Tuesday, July 30 in Mumbai. The meeting is expected to give clarity on the number of retentions teams can make.\n\nGlenn Maxwell was bought by RCB for Rs 14.25 crore ahead of IPL 2021, and was retained for Rs 11 crore the following year. He fetched the same amount in 2023 and 2024.\n\nHowever, his performance saw a massive dip in the last season in which he scored 52 runs in 10 matches at an average of 5.78 and a strike rate of 120.93. He took a voluntary break midway through the tournament to get into a better mental space, but failed once again on his return ahead of the play-offs. In the Eliminator, he was dismissed for a first-ball duck as RCB lost to Rajasthan Royals.\n\nGlenn Maxwell was axed from Punjab Kings squads after a similar horror run in IPL 2020. In that season, he scored 108 runs in 13 matches at an average of 15.42 and a strike rate of 101.88.\n\nVirat kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell formed a formidable trio at RCB even though they failed to hand RCB their maiden IPL trophy. But going by the latest developments, it's very likely that Maxwell and du Plessis would be released by the Bengaluru-based franchise.\n\nThe IPL owners meeting with the BCCI will also have discussion over the reintroduction of Right-To-Match option (RTM). The owners are keen on having the option to five to six retentions. If the RTM option is brought back, or an increased number of retentions are allowed, RCB could look to retain Maxwell at a lower price.",

    "body": "Former Australian cricket team’s captain Steve Smith recently led his side the Washington Freedom to their maiden Major League Cricket (MLC) title, beating the San Francisco Unicorns in the final match to win the coveted MLC 2024 Trophy. Steve Smith played a key role for his team as a captain and batter.\n\nFind Best Betting Tips and Predictions for India vs Sri Lanka Series Here\n\nAlthough Steve Smith is not very much known for his T20 game, Smith proved everyone wrong in the MLC. There were much confusion among the cricket enthusiasts as to why the Ricky Ponting led side opted to bring Steve Smith into the fold that included players like Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell etc.\n\nBut Steve Smith proved all his doubters wrong. The Washington Freedom finished at the top of the table with 5 wins and 1 loss from their 7 matches. The 35-years-old Steve Smith led side dominated the playoffs, beating the San Francisco Unicorns in the Qualifier and the Final by 7 wickets and 96 runs respectively.\n\nNot only did Steve Smith led his side really well, he contributed significantly with the bat as well. Smith scored 336 runs from 9 innings with a strike rate of 148.67 and average of 56. With this brilliant performance from Smith, he certainly has managed to turn some IPL teams’ attention towards himself, especially some teams who maybe looking for a new captain in the upcoming IPL 2025 Mega Auction later this year. In this article, we take a look at _ teams who maybe to willing to sign Steve Smith as captain for IPL 2025.\n\nPunjab Kings\n\nAn Australian captain and Punjab Kings is a good combination. Punjab Kings (Formerly Kings XI Punjab) reached their last IPL final way back in the year 2014, which unfortunately they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders. They had an Australian George Bailey as their captain. Since then, Glenn Maxwell has been the other Aussie to captain Punjab, but they never reached the previous heights again. The Kings recently had Shikhar Dhawan and Sam Curran as captain in IPL 2024 and it seems they will be looking for a captain in the IPL 2025 Mega Auction. In that case, Steve Smith can be an option Punjab Kings may go after. Smith would easily be able to give them 2 seasons atleast as captain.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have had the privilege of having some really great captains over the years in the IPL, the likes of Virat Kohli and current Faf du Plessis. However, there might be some debate of captaincy options at RCB as their current captain Faf du Plessis is currently 40-years-old. In that case, Steve Smith would be a good short-term captaincy option for them to prepare their next captain as Smith would easily be able to give 2 season.\n\nLucknow Super Giants\n\nSteve Smith already has a relationship with the Super Giants. Steve Smith was with the Rising Pune Supergiant in the IPL in 2016 and 2017, when they joined the league in place of CSK and Rajasthan, where he replaced MS Dhoni as the captain of the team and led his side to the final, which unfortunately they lost against Mumbai Indians by 1 run. Since then, Smith only featured in the 2021 IPL season for Delhi Capitals and never found a place again. Lucknow Super Giants have the same owners as Pune Supergiant and with team’s captain KL Rahul likely to leave, the management might turn to their former leader Steve Smith.",
    "summary": "* Steve Smith led his team, Washington Freedom, to their maiden MLC title, defeating San Francisco Unicorns in the final.\n* Despite doubts about his T20 skills, Smith proved himself as a captain and batter, leading his team to the top of the table with 5 wins and 1 loss in 7 matches.\n* Smith scored 336 runs from 9 innings with a strike rate of 148.67 and an average of 56.\n* His impressive performance has turned the attention of some IPL teams towards him, potentially as a captain for the upcoming IPL 2025 Mega Auction.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to summarize anything else!",

If these players enter the IPL mega auction, they could command high bids.\n\nFinn Allen (New Zealand) (IPL 2025)\n\nFinn Allen was the third-highest run-scorer in Major League Cricket 2024. He batted explosively throughout the season, scoring 306 runs in 9 innings at an average of 34 and a strike rate of 187.73. Allen notched up one century and two fifties during the season.\n\nFinn Allen hails from New Zealand and has previously played in the IPL, but he went unsold in the last auction. This time, teams will be eager to acquire him. In the mega auction, he could attract bids worth millions as he fulfills the role of a powerful opener for any team.\n\nSteve Smith (Australia)\n\nSteve Smith was the second top-scorer of the season, delivering remarkable performances. As captain of Washington Freedom, Smith scored 336 runs in 9 matches at an average of 56.00 and a strike rate of 148. He hit three fifties and played as an opening batsman, providing quick starts alongside Travis Head, leading his team to victory.\n\nSteve Smith is known as a player for ODIs and Tests. He went unsold in the IPL 2024 auction and was subsequently left out of Australia’s T20 World Cup 2024 squad. However, following his strong performance in Major League Cricket, Smith is expected to be in high demand in the IPL 2025 mega auction.\n\nAlso read: How Many Retentions will be Allowed in IPL 2025 Auction? Details Revealed\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar (USA)\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar impressed everyone with his bowling in the T20 World Cup 2024. An Indian-origin player who shifted to the USA years ago, Netravalkar has played for India’s U-19 team. In Major League Cricket 2024, he took 15 wickets in 7 matches at an economy rate of 7.67 for the champion team Washington Freedom.\n\nSaurabh is a left-arm fast bowler who excels in bowling during the powerplay and has the skill to maintain accurate line and length in death overs. Scoring against him is not easy for any batter. This is why, when Saurabh enters the IPL 2025 mega auction, franchises are expected to bid heavily to secure his services.",

    "body": "Major League Cricket 2024 attracted a lot of viewers this time around. Hence, a few IPL teams would consider this league while planning for their squads next season. Here, we take a look at the list of three top performers in MLC 2024 who might be selected for the IPL 2025 Mega Auctions.\n\n1) Finn Allen\n\nWith a strike rate close to 190, Finn Allen was in brilliant touch in MLC 2024. He also scored a lot of runs and that makes him an exciting option to have in the team.\n\nFinn Allen was in RCB a few years ago but did not get a single game. Considering he is also a reliable wicket-keeper, he could be a must-have for some teams. The Kiwi is still young and would be an investment for the future. Therefore, many franchises could line up for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Steve Smith\n\nSteve Smith is one of the top performers in MLC 2024 who might be selected for the IPL 2025 Mega Auctions. The Australian cricketer was in brilliant form in the tournament. He finished as the second-highest run-getter and also won the tournament as the skipper.\n\nThere would be some teams who would like to have the experience and skills of Steve Smith at the top of the order. If needed, teams like Punjab Kings could also take him as the skipper. Hence, he is on this list.\n\n3) Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nThe USA cricketer had a strong run in the 2024 T20 World Cup. With 15 wickets, he also finished as the highest wicket-taker of MLC 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaurabh is basically excellent with the new ball, especially with his movement and his angle. If not as the lead overseas pacer, as a backup, he would be a solid choice to have in the team. Mumbai Indians usually prefer to have two left-arm seamers in the squad. Therefore, such teams could target the cricketer.",

    "body": "The Cognizant Major League Cricket Season 2 final took place in Grand Prairie Texas on Sunday night with the Washington Freedom taking on the San Francisco Unicorns before an energetic sold-out crowd.\n\nFans started pouring into the stadium early, and many stayed well past the closing ceremonies, savoring every last minute of their summer of cricket.\n\nThe drones stole the show\n\nWhile the Cognizant Major League Cricket is packed with many of the world’s top cricketers, several of whom were on the field Sunday, the real star of the event was the drone halftime show.\n\nThe Freedom, who lost the toss, got off to a thundering start putting up a formidable 207 for 5, behind the impressive knocks of Captain Steve Smith (88 off 52 balls including seven 4s and six 6es), Glenn Maxwell (40 off 22 balls) and Andries Gous (21 off 14 balls).\n\nSoon after the Freedom finished their innings, a little past 9PM local time, the stadium lights went off, and fans were treated to a 10 minute display of lights and colors, as an army of drones created picture after cricket-themed picture against a backdrop of music and the pitch black Dallas sky.\n\nAlmost as loud as the hit songs were the roars of the crowd with every scene change.\n\nHere are some of the visual highlights:\n\nGetting their money’s worth\n\nAfter the drone show, the most popular attraction with fans were, interestingly, the sponsor activation booths.\n\nRoyal Foods was giving out cups of rice and opportunities to join a promotion; and Remitly was giving out merchandise. Fans were lining up in droves for both.\n\nSponsors were front and center later in the evening as well. Two sponsor representatives — Todd Myers, COO of Willow TV (which was both a sponsor as well as the official broadcast partner for the US and Canada), and Dominic Rae, Sponsorships Manager for Stake — participated in the post-match awards ceremony.\n\nWillow TV’s Myers presented Saurabh Netravalkar with the tournament’s Leading Wicket Taker award.\n\nStake’s Rae, an Australian resident himself, presented Travis Head with the Player of the Tournament award.\n\nIn addition, USA Cricket’s new CEO, Johnathan Atkeison — in attendance a few days before officially starting on the job — presented the Domestic Player of the Tournament to the Unicorns’ Hassan Khan.\n\nSlight anticlimax\n\nIn contrast to the Freedom, the Unicorns’ innings fell apart pretty quickly, as they lost three early wickets in the power play. With a high target (208) and a high and climbing required run rate, the pressure resulted in a quick succession of dismissals.\n\nIn the end, they were all out for 111 after only 16 innings. The Freedom won the championship handily, by 96 runs.\n\nLet freedom reign\n\nThat anticlimactic end of the match did not take away from the Freedom’s victory and accomplishment — in fact, it enhanced it.\n\nThey dominated the tournament, finishing at the top of the table, and only losing once to the Unicorns, who they then went on to defeat twice.\n\nAfter the match, during and after the awards ceremony, the extended Freedom family celebrated on the pitch. Team owner Sanjay Govil could be seen celebrating with the Freedom’s players and staff.\n\nCEO Dhiraj Malhotra, an IPL and ICC veteran, was walking around greeting the opposition and making sure all players and guests were taken care of, and Head of Marketing Sumeet Rajpal was capturing moments to share on the team’s social channels.\n\nWe’re pinching ourselves\n\nFor American fans of cricket, MLC Season 2 was an absolute delight.\n\nTo have top foreign stars in our midst for a full month, on the heels of the World Cup, was cricket ecstasy: Pat Cummins, Lockie Ferguson, Rachin Ravindra, Haris Rauf, Rashid Khan, Sunil Narine, Marcus Stoinis, Jason Roy, David Miller, Faf du Plessis — and too many others to name. The talent level in the MLC 2 was probably second only to the IPL as far as T20 tournaments go.\n\nTo top it off, many American cricketers shone brightly throughout July: some cricket household names (Netravalkar, Gous, Ali Khan, and Corey Anderson, among others) and some new stars, including the Unicorns’ Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Hassan Khan (the latter being awarded domestic player of the tournament).\n\nThis was something US cricket fans would never have even dared imagined just a few years ago.\n\nMLC Co-Founder Sameer Mehta summed up the sentiment for us well during the post-match celebrations: “look at this — this is all very real.”\n\nThis statement captured the years of vision and effort on the part of Mehta and his co-founder Vijay Srinivasan to make Sunday happen.\n\nIndeed, major kudos to the MLC team that put on this final as well as the whole tournament: Mehta and Srinivasan, Monica Sadhu, Justin Geale, Zubin Surkari, Mervyn Pereira, William Swann, Selby Sturzenegger, David White, and many others — and of course to all the MLC teams and their staffs, and many other outside partners (not least the team from Kojo, spearheaded by Britt Prince).\n\nWe are already getting extremely excited for Season 3.",

The board, which will meet quarterly with senior CPL staff, includes prominent figures such as West Indies men's white-ball coach Darren Sammy and West Indies women's captain Hayley Matthews.\n\nThe advisory board also features Dr. Akshai Mansingh, CPL’s Joint Chief Medical Officer, and Dr. Maryam Abdool-Richards, Principal Medical Officer at the Trinidad & Tobago Ministry of Health. This diverse team of experts is tasked with advising the CPL on leveraging its platform to create and promote health and wellness programs.\n\nPete Russell, CPL’s CEO, expressed enthusiasm about the initiative, stating, \"Health, fitness, and wellbeing are very important issues across the Caribbean and around the world, and we want to use cricket and our platform as a force for good in this area.

Starting this season, there will be activities at the games that will create a fun vibe around health and fitness, allowing everyone to join in and be part of it.\"\n\nDarren Sammy, the newly appointed West Indies men's head coach, emphasized the importance of health and wellbeing, especially for young people. \"The health and wellbeing of the Caribbean people is hugely important to me, especially our young people who we work very hard through my foundation.

As someone who manages a sporting career while suffering with diabetes, I hope that I can add a unique perspective to the discussions.\"\n\nThe CPL's Health, Fitness, and Wellbeing Advisory Board represents a significant step towards integrating health and wellness into the fabric of Caribbean cricket, ensuring that the sport not only entertains but also contributes positively to the community.

But I think this series has been a step forward for us. It has been a while for us to get a series win and we'll never take that for granted.\"\n\nJamie Smith also impressed, and McCullum was quick to hail the wicketkeeper.\n\n\"When you’re in that position at seven and wicketkeeper you're like the drummer in the band,\" he said.\n\n\"You need to be prepared to take risks and he's happy to do that, and he backs himself that he's got the power game when the field is out.\n\n\"No [criticism of] guys that have been before, they've done great jobs for us, but we identified that it was an area where we wanted to add a little bit more punch.\"\n\nOf Atkinson, who took 22 wickets across the three matches, McCullum added: \"He's such a quiet man. He’s got inner confidence and a real confidence in his ability and skills.\n\n\"He's moved the ball off the seam both ways, hits great lengths, bowled high pace and committed to the bouncer plan and done what the captain asked and sustained it.\n\n\"He's been outstanding and he's quite cheeky within the group too and the guys love him.\"\n\nCaptain Stokes, meanwhile, also took on a starring role in the final Test, as he plundered England's quickest Test half-century, knocking off 50 in just 28 balls.",

The team will be looking to do it one last time and become the second team to lay their hands on the coveted trophy.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nWhile the Washington Freedom have played the best cricket in the tournament, the San Francisco Unicorns have been a close second. While the Freedom have played all-round cricket, the Unicorns have been led well by their skipper Corey Anderson.\n\nFinn Allenn has given them great starts at the top of the order and for the majority of the tournament was aided by the presence of Matt Short. The Aussie top-order batter however as went away to play The Hundred and will not be available for this game. So, the onus will be on Allen to give them a significant start. However, players like Hassan Khan and Sanjay Krishnamurthi have stepped in the last couple of games.

    "body": "Good Saturday morning! I hope those of you in the U.S. are enjoying a long, peaceful holiday weekend. And hopefully your neighborhood is quieter than mine was last night. Enough with the fireworks already!! I’m going to be up early and on the road today, then this evening I have to fill in for someone at my other job. I’ll try to monitor the comments as best as I can, when I have time and good reception.\n\nNow then, let’s welcome back Major League Cricket for its second season. Last year I did a uni review for the inaugural kits. It includes a brief explanation of what T-20 cricket is, and why this league genuinely deserves to be called “Major,” so if you’re unfamiliar with the sport, do give that a look. Last night, Season Two opened with a couple of games… one in Morrisville, North Carolina and the other in Grand Prairie, Texas. The first matchup featured the defending champion MI New York…\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n…taking on the Seattle Orcas.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nMI NY (the MI stands for Mumbai Indians, the Indian Premier League franchise that runs this team) made some tweaks from last year’s uni, dropping the dark pants stripe in favor of a thin gold stripe that also crosses the backside, and changing the tinsel-y side panels to a diamond pattern. The one thing they DESPERATELY needed to drop was those shiny gold numbers that the parent club is so fond of wearing. Yeah, in the right light *and* at the right angle they look fine.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nBut as you saw in the first photo, they can be illegible even in the same lighting. Such a shame, because with regular gold numbers, this could be a really good uni. I especially like the…I guess that’s an art deco sublimation on the jerseys.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nSeattle looks pretty much the same from last year’s kit.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nI will be saying that for some other teams as well, and when I do I realize some of them have different ads on the jerseys and/or pants. I don’t care about that. I’m trying my best to ignore the ads and enjoy the cricket. So glad the Orcas logo remains on the batting helmets. That’s my favorite logo from the whole league.\n\nThe second game featured the Texas Super Kings hosting the LA Knight Riders in a vibrant matchup.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nLA really toned down the gold sublimation this year as opposed to last season. The purple seems toned down as well. I would have kept that the same, but overall I like this version better. Also, I really REALLY like bowler Ali Khan’s jersey!\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nIt’s always nice to see when players are allowed to opt out of wearing the jersey ad. LA’s main advertiser is a betting site out of Bangladesh. I wouldn’t wear that either. You can get a better look at Ali Khan and both team’s unis in this video of him taking three of his four wickets…one of them thanks to a great barehanded catch by Derone Davis.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nI’m usually not one for a lot of technology in sports, but I do love those light-up stumps. I also love how LA Gets It with their use of gold. Yes, the helmets and pads are a little shiny, but not in a reflective way.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nThe numbers, as you saw in the video, are just right. Meanwhile, Texas seems the same as last year. I liked it then and I like it now.\n\nThat leaves two teams that haven’t played yet. The Washington Freedom looks the same in the lede photo as they did last season, while the San Francisco Unicorns appear to have dropped their contrasting blue sleeves in favor of a more orange jersey. I’m calling this a downgrade, but we’ll see how it looks once they actually take the field today. Here’s a closer look of all the new uniforms.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nThe reason I said “Don’t blink” in the headline is because while most T-20 leagues play for roughly two months, Major League Cricket is played completely in the month of July. For now. Each of the six teams play seven regular season games, half of what is played in the IPL. It’s almost the same length as the Caribbean Premier League, which starts at the end of August and ends in the first week of October. So enjoy all the MLC action while you can!",

Now, despite changing to US citizenship, Chand was left out of the USA squad that shocked everyone and reached the Super 8 of the 2024 T20 World Cup. However, Chand, 31, has a point to prove, and started off the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) - USA's franchise T20 league - with a swashbuckling half-century.\n\nInterestingly, Chand's present MLC franchise is Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), who are owned by the Knight Riders group. Many might remember that Chand's downfall started when he was famously clean bowled by Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Brett Lee in the opening ball of IPL 2013.\n\nAfter finishing bottom of the table in the first season of MLC last year, LAKR required a strong start to MLC 2024. Chand, coming in to bat at no. 3, took charge in the opening match against Texas Super Kings, after openers Jason Roy and Sunil Narine had been dismissed for two runs each.\n\nChand made 68 off 45 balls, hitting six 4s and three 6s. No other batter in the LAKR lineup crossed 30, and only one crossed 20. It was Chand's effort that took LAKR to a respectable total of 162/7.\n\nStar names like David Miller and Andre Russell failed to score big as well. Russell only made 10, while Miller was out for four after his T20 World Cup final heartbreak.\n\nIn response, Texas Super Kings (TSK) fell short by 12 runs. Frontline USA pacer Ali Khan dismantled the TSK middle order, picking up three wickets, that saw TSK lose four wickets in five balls between the 14th and 15th over.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders next play San Francisco Unicorns on July 8.",

Washington Freedom captain Steve Smith won the toss and elected to field first.\n\nThe decision proved to be wise as USA's rising cricket star Saurabh Netravalkar spearheaded the bowling attack with a superb performance. Netravalkar, named 'Player of the Match,' delivered an impressive spell, claiming 3 wickets for just 24 runs.\n\nHe was well-supported by fellow pacer Justin Dill, who also took 3 wickets, conceding 33 runs. The pair ensured that MI New York's batting line-up never found stability, with wickets falling at regular intervals.\n\nDespite the regular fall of wickets, West Indies power-hitter Nicholas Pooran showcased his batting prowess with a rapid 44 off 30 balls, keeping the scoreboard ticking. Contributions from Afghanistan all-rounder Rashid Khan, who scored a quickfire 31 off 15 balls, and South African fast bowler Anrich Nortje, with 14 off 9 balls, helped MI New York reach a respectable total of 154 for 9 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nChasing a target of 155 with rain clouds threatening, Washington Freedom's innings got off to a shaky start. Australian World Cup winner Travis Head fell early for just 1 run in the second over.\n\nHowever, Steve Smith, who opened the innings with Head, anchored the chase with a measured yet aggressive approach. Smith played a captain's knock, scoring an unbeaten 46 off 28 balls, including 4 fours and 3 sixes. His steady presence at the crease was complemented by Andries Gous, who supported well from the other end.\n\nAs Washington reached 55 for 1 in 7.4 overs, play was halted due to lightning, followed by rain, which prevented any further action. With no resumption in sight, the match officials resorted to the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method to determine the result. Thanks to Smith's brisk scoring rate, Washington Freedom edged out MI New York by four runs under the DLS calculations, securing their first win of the season.",

The match was a tightly contested one. In the second innings, Washington Freedom faced an early setback with the dismissal of Travis Head (1). Steve Smith initially took a couple of overs to settle in, but once he found his rhythm and struck his first boundary on his seventh ball, the New York bowlers struggled to contain him. The Australian star batter smashed four fours and three sixes, racing to an impressive 46* off 28 balls. On Which Channel MLC 2024 Will Be Telecast Live?

However, Smith’s power-hitting in the final over of the powerplay took them ahead on DLS with a score of 55/1. In the end, that proved enough to seal the match as rain played spoilsport.\n\nEarlier in the day, the MI New York struggled to score freely against a disciplined bowling attack after being put into bat first. Despite Nicholas Pooran's valiant effort, scoring a 30-ball 44, New York faced consistent setbacks with regular loss of wickets. Opener Ruben Clinton (28) gave his team a strong platform with a good start, but the introduction of Glenn Maxwell proved lethal as he was bowled while attempting a reverse sweep.\n\nWith Monank Patel (5) and Shayan Jahangir (6) having lost their wickets, all eyes were on Pooran, who found the regular boundaries. Despite the wickets falling at the other end, Pooran kept the pressure on the Washington Freedom bowlers.\n\nLockie Ferguson was the breakthrough bowler for MI New York, as Pooran’s mistimed shot fell to Glenn Maxwell. Eventually, Pooran was aided by a crucial cameo from Rashid Khan, who smashed 31 off 15, and some valuable boundaries from Anrich Nortje (14), which propelled them to 154.

As they begin a fresh campaign against the same team, Washington will be eager to exact revenge.\n\nThe franchise has made wholesale changes to its squad, especially when it comes to international players, with Akeal Hosein and Marco Jansen being the only ones retained. The biggest names are undoubtedly the Aussie trio of Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head.\n\nThey add plenty of firepower to the top and middle order, and Freedom will be looking towards a big total if any one of them gets going. Rachin Ravindra too makes a debut in the squad, adding all-round capabilities.\n\nAndre Tye and Lockie Ferguson will join Saurabh Netravalkar in the pace department, while Yasir Mohammad and Amila Aponso are likely to be the two spinners in the playing XI.\n\nWashington Freedom Playing 11\n\nTravis Head, Andries Gous, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Justin Dill, Akeal Hosein, Lockie Ferguson, Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nMI New York\n\nThe defending champions began the season with a bang by defeating the Seattle Orcas in a convincing fashion. However, as they play their second match in less than 24 hours, New York must keep their momentum going.\n\nNicholas Pooran was once again in top form as he smashed an unbeaten half-century to help his team chase down a modest target quite easily. He, along with Shayan Jahangir, and Steven Taylor makes up for a strong middle order. New York is also likely to avail the services of Tim David and Kieron Pollard as all-rounders.\n\nNew York boasts one of the strongest and well-balanced bowling units in the league.\n\nTrent Boult, Ehsan Adil, and Anrich Nortje are the 3 quality seamers on the team who picked up 5 wickets between them on Friday. Rashid Khan, who is fresh off a brilliant T20 World Cup campaign, will lead the spin attack.\n\nMI New York Playing 11\n\nRuben Clinton, Monank Patel, Nicholas Pooran, Shayan Jahangir, Timothy David, Kieron Pollard, Rashid Khan, Nosthush Kenjige, Trent Boult, Anrich Nortje, Ehsan Adil.",

    "body": "The Stateside cricket fever continues as the new Major League Cricket season is here to fill the void after the T20I World Cup. After a successful first season, the franchise cricket league is set to return with even more flair. ICC has granted List A accreditation to the competition, so it will be able to attract more star power from around the world. Who will win the second edition of Major League Cricket? Join us for our exclusive 2024 MLC predictions and tips.\n\nMLC 2024: Cricket Event Details\n\nSome of the team crests and names might make you think that Major League Cricket is the US expansion of the Indian Premier League. While the competition has a strong connection to the IPL, MLC is attempting to carve its own identity into the vast and diverse sporting landscape of the US.\n\nSix teams return to battle it out for the MLC title, just like last season, to grab the attention of the best cricket World Cup bookies. All the action unfolds at the familiar Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park, with matches running from 5th to 28th of July. Get ready to see some of the world’s biggest T20 stars lighting up the American cricket scene with their world-class finesse.\n\nℹ️ Tournament: 2024 Major League Cricket, T20 Cricket Tournament 📝 Format: Round-robin system with playoffs 🏏 Venues: Grand Prairie Stadium, Grand Prairie, Nashville, Tennessee 🗓️ Dates: Friday, 5 July to Sunday, 28 July, 2024\n\nMI New York @ 3.25 (9/4)\n\nNew York edged into the playoffs last year, then turned on the afterburners, thanks to a fiery batting display by Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran. The latter, in particular, was unstoppable in the final, smashing an unbeaten 137 to secure the MLC title for New York. With a bowling attack boasting Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Trent Boult, and the ever-reliable Kieron Pollard, they’ll be firm favorites to defend their crown. What do we think of them in our 2024 MLC season predictions? We’ll find out later.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns @ 4.60 (18/5)\n\nThe Unicorns’ 2023 season was a heartbreaker. Despite only managing two wins, they were agonizingly edged out of the playoffs by the eventual champions, MI New York, on net run rate. But they haven’t sat still. They’ve brought in some exciting new talent, so expect a much stronger showing this year. Could they be a real threat to make the playoffs? Those who bet on MLC 2024 online believe they can.\n\nWashington Freedom @ 7.00 (6/1)\n\nWith a lineup packed with big hitters like the in-form South African Andries Gous, fresh off his World Cup heroics, and the established duo of Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head, they have the firepower to go all the way. Their bowling attack is a force to be reckoned with, too, boasting the pace of Kiwi Lockie Ferguson and the spin wizardry of South Africa’s Marco Jansen. Make bets safe but entertaining while placing your punt on Washington making the playoffs.\n\nSeattle Orcas @ 7.00 (6/1)\n\nAfter dominating the group stage with four wins out of five, they went on a tear through the Eliminator and Challenger, only to fall short in the final. Given the quality of the Orcas squad, many 2024 MLC predictions will see them making a deep run in the tournament once again. With two world-class hitters like Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen leading the charge and a bolstered bowling attack thanks to the draft, the Seattle side will look to nail down the title that narrowly escaped them last year.\n\nMI New York to Win Outright @ 3.25 (9/4)\n\nMain Prediction\n\nMI New York to Win Outright\n\nBest odds:\n\n3.25 (9/4)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n2 (100%)\n\n0\n\nMI New York took their time to get going last season, but they could turn up the heat much earlier this season. According to the 2024 Major League Cricket odds, Nicholas Pooran and company are the frontrunners in the title race. After taking a deep look into their squad, we are convinced that they have the best chance as well.\n\nMI New York boasts a terrifying pace attack this season, spearheaded by the lethal trio of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and Anrich Nortje. Together, these world-class fast bowlers can dismantle any batting lineup in the tournament.\n\nComplementing their fearsome pace attack, MI New York has a crafty spin duo that will make life difficult for opposing batsmen. The legendary Rashid Khan leads the spin department, with rising star Nosthush Kenjige providing support.\n\nNicholas Pooran, Dewald Brevis, Kieron Pollard, and Tim David are a nightmare to face for any bowling attack. These hard hitters can single-handedly change the game’s momentum with their explosive batting.\n\nBut MI New York’s batting depth doesn’t stop there. Players like Monank Patel, Rashid Khan, and Romario Shepherd offer valuable flexibility, providing the right mix of power and stability depending on the situation and pitch.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders and MI New York to Play the Final @ 5.00 (4/1)\n\nRisky Bet\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders and MI New York to Play the Final\n\nBest odds:\n\n5.00 (4/1)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n1 (50%)\n\n(50%) 1\n\nWe are rooting for the Los Angeles Knight Riders to have a strong season this time around following their horror debut campaign.\n\nSeasoned T20 veterans like Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, and Shakib Al Hasan bring both dynamism and depth to the squad. Their extensive experience is a valuable asset, and the team will undoubtedly be leaning on these three stalwarts to significantly improve upon their last-place finish from the previous season.\n\nWe believe the 2024 Los Angeles Knight Riders squad has what it takes to make a grand final run, but MI New York might be too overpowering for them in the final.\n\nTravis Head Highest Run Scorer @ 7.50 (13/2)\n\nRisky Bet\n\nTravis Head Highest Run Scorer\n\nBest odds:\n\n7.50 (13/2)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n2 (100%)\n\n0\n\nFueled by Travis Head’s explosive batting, the Washington Freedom have a strong chance to make a deep run in the tournament. While a championship victory might be out of reach, they could become a real force to be reckoned with, with Head leading the charge.\n\nThe Aussie opener has shown excellent T20 form this year. He was one of the Orange Cap contenders in the IPL with 567 runs to his name in 15 innings. For his country, he has returned 255 runs in seven appearances.\n\nFresh off his T20 World Cup experience in the Americas, the left-handed batsman appears primed to dominate the MLC scoring charts.\n\nTrent Boult Highest Wicket Taker @ 11.00 (10/1)\n\nRisky Bet\n\nTrent Boult Highest Wicket Taker\n\nBest odds:\n\n11.00 (10/1)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n1 (50%)\n\n(50%) 1\n\nTrent Boult was instrumental in MI New York’s historic campaign last year. The Kiwi paceman bagged a staggering 22 wickets, twice the number of his closest competitor.\n\nOver the years, Boult has established himself as one of the most lethal bowlers in T20 cricket. He has been particularly effective during power-play overs. With an excellent ability to swing the ball with incredible pace, Boult will be back to terrorize the batters once again in MI New York colors.\n\nThe recently retired New Zealand pacer hunted down nine wickets in four appearances for his country this year before hanging up his Black Caps kit. He also claimed 15 wickets in the 2024 IPL season. Everything points toward another sensational MLC campaign for the 34-year-old.",

Playing for San Francisco Unicorns, Rauf picked up four wickets in nine games.\n\nComing back to the 2022 T20 World Cup, India and Pakistan had a thrilling matchup that went right down to the wire and saw Virat Kohli play one of the greatest knocks in T20I history.

Responding to this, an annoyed Rauf just nodded his head and said yes.\n\nSpeaking about those sixes, Haris Rauf complimented Virat Kohli and described him as the only batter who can hit those shots. Rauf said, \"The way he [Kohli] played in the World Cup, that is his class, we all know the types of shots he plays. And the way he hit those sixes, I don't think any other player can hit a shot like that off my bowling.

    "date": "Thu Aug  1 10:51:02 2024",
    "body": "Cricket\n\n-OneArabia\n\nBy OneArabia\n\nFinn Allen, the New Zealand international cricketer, made headlines with his impressive performance in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. The 25-year-old opener showcased his aggressive batting style, catching the attention of many cricket enthusiasts.\n\nDespite his remarkable performance in MLC 2024, where he scored 306 runs in nine matches at an average of 34, Allen did not attract any bids at the IPL 2024 auction. He had registered for the auction with a base price of INR 75 lakh. His strike rate of 187.73 was the highest in the tournament, making him a valuable asset for any T20 team.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad could greatly benefit from Allen's batting prowess. Known for their aggressive approach last season, which led to record-breaking totals, the Sunrisers might be keen to sign him. His ability to accelerate scoring could be a perfect fit for their strategy.\n\nThe Chennai Super Kings (CSK), five-time IPL champions, might also show interest in Allen. Their previous signing of Rachin Ravindra for INR 1.8 crore did not yield expected results as he struggled as an opener. CSK might consider offloading Ravindra and bringing in Allen to strengthen their lineup and improve their chances in powerplay overs.\n\nGujarat Titans, who won the IPL trophy in their debut season in 2022 but failed to qualify for playoffs in 2024, might look to sign quality players like Finn Allen. Adding him to their squad could enhance their performance and help them dominate future seasons.\n\nAllen's performance in MLC 2024 has undoubtedly strengthened his resume as an aggressive batter. Although he did not secure a spot in IPL 2024, his skills make him a sought-after player for upcoming auctions. Teams looking to boost their batting lineup will likely consider him a valuable addition.\n\nIn summary, Finn Allen's explosive batting style makes him an attractive option for several IPL teams. Sunrisers Hyderabad, Chennai Super Kings, and Gujarat Titans are among those who might pursue him in future auctions to bolster their squads and improve their chances of success.\n\nStory first published: Thursday, August 1, 2024, 10:51 [GST]",

    "body": "Photo Credit: Instagram Photo of @gavaskarsunilofficial\n\nFormer Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has raised serious concerns following the conclusion of Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024). The Washington Freedom won the tournament, defeating the San Francisco Unicorns in the final at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nGavaskar, who was in the US as part of the broadcast team, witnessed drastic changes in MLC 2024. Despite featuring several international stars, he expressed disappointment over the league’s overall quality.\n\nThe former Indian captain noted a significant decline in MLC’s standards compared to its inaugural season and pointed out the poor crowd turnout for MLC 2024, which contrasted sharply with the enthusiastic attendance in the first edition.\n\nGavaskar has suggested a major overhaul to restore the tournament’s prestige, including imposing restrictions on players’ participation in other franchise T20 leagues to ensure higher competitive cricket and deliver world-class entertainment to fans.\n\nSunil Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar: “For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual.”\n\nGavaskar suggested limiting players to three T20 leagues worldwide to maintain high standards and competitiveness. He emphasized the IPL as the top league and recommended players choose two other leagues to participate in.\n\nHe added, “While nobody wants the players’ source of income to be curbed, I feel it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in three leagues of their choice. The IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So, the player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice.”\n\nGavaskar explained that players often compete for one IPL team while representing rival IPL teams in other T20 leagues. This is understandable if their IPL team isn’t in those leagues, but it’s odd to see players in rival IPL jerseys elsewhere.",

This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer.\n\n\"It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, makes you less susceptible to injuries,\" he added.\n\nCummins had a busy last 12 months after fracturing his wrist towards the end of the Ashes campaign in England.\n\nHe played in an ODI series against India, the triumphant ODI World Cup campaign, three Tests against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour of New Zealand, two Tests against New Zealand, the Indian Premier League, the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the MLC tournament.\n\n\"I'm very sore today after a week of gym.

Since 2017, Australia has failed to lay its hands on the trophy, with India winning four consecutive series including the historic triumphs on Australian soil in 2018-19 and 2020-21.\n\nAnd, Cummins is desperate to lift the trophy this summer under his captaincy.\n\n\"It's the trophy I haven't won before... this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven't ticked off,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"We've achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\n\"That's what lies ahead of us this summer. They're (India) a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Cummins is in no mood to quit T20 cricket as of now, and hopes to help Australia win the gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make its debut at the quadrennial showpiece.\n\n\"Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"I'd love to be on that side (at LA28). I think I'll be 35 or something, so hopefully still there or thereabouts.\n\n\"Honestly right now, it feels a long way away. Maybe once we get closer and start building into it, everyone gets a bit more excited,\" he said.",

This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer. It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, makes you less susceptible to injuries,” he quoted.\n\nPat Cummins eyes Border Gavaskar Trophy win\n\nCummins, who has won all big titles, except for the Border Gavaskar Trophy, has his eyes set to the title. While adding that it is the only trophy he and several of his teammates haven’t won, Pat Cummins recalled some of his major achievements as captain of the side. “I’s the trophy I haven’t won before…. this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven’t ticked off,” Cummins told Fox Cricket.\n\n\"We've achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams. That's what lies ahead of us this summer. They're (India) a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" he added.",

The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is of particular significance, as Australia has suffered back-to-back series defeats to India on home soil in 2018/19 and 2020/21.\n\nCummins believes that skipping the UK tour will allow him to address any lingering physical strains and return in peak condition, ready to lead Australia in what promises to be a critical series. \"Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher; you never regret it,\" Cummins told Fox Sports.\n\n\"I've basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago.

During India’s last tour of Australia in 2020/21, the visitors staged a remarkable comeback. After a humiliating start in Adelaide, where India was bowled out for a mere 36 in the day/night Test, the series seemed headed for disaster.\n\nHowever, despite losing key players, including then-captain Virat Kohli, and fielding a makeshift bowling attack in the final Test, India clinched a 2-1 series victory.\n\nThe crowning achievement came at the Gabba, a venue where Australia had remained unbeaten since 1989.\n\nCummins, who was part of the Australian squad during that series, is determined to change the outcome this time around. \"They're a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" Cummins remarked.",

The series will be particularly critical for the Aussies, as they have conceded successive series defeats to India at home (in 2018/19 and 2020/21).\n\n“Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it,” Cummins was quoted as saying by Fox Sports.\n\n“I’ve basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer”.\n\n“It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, makes you less susceptible to injuries,” he added.\n\n“It’s the trophy I haven’t won before… this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven’t ticked off,” Cummins said.\n\n“We’ve achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\n“That’s what lies ahead of us this summer. They’re (India) a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we’re really well placed also,” he added.",

He finished the T20 tournament as the franchise’s equal leading run-scorer, amassing 336 runs at an impressive strike rate of 148.67.\n\nIn the final against the San Francisco Unicorns, Smith played a crucial role, scoring 88 runs off 52 balls.

For this stellar performance, he was adjudged the player of the match.\n\nSmith expressed his desire for another opportunity in the IPL. Despite not featuring in the tournament since 2021, where he went unsold in the previous auctions, he remains optimistic. He stated, “I feel like in every opportunity I’ve had in T20 cricket recently and franchise stuff, I’ve played quite nicely. So hopefully, I just keep putting my name up there and enjoying it.”\n\nReflecting on his absence from international T20s, Smith acknowledged the selectors’ preference for younger players. He remains unfazed, focusing on personal improvement and growth. “I’ll just go about my business, keep trying to improve and get better,” he said.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of competing in the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, Smith remained open-minded. “Never say never,” he remarked, hinting at the distant yet intriguing prospect.\n\nSteve Smith’s resurgence in MLC has fueled his determination to make a triumphant IPL comeback.

And finally, it’s there.\n\n“It’s only four years away. Once again, in the US by that stage, hopefully, with MLC (Major League Cricket), another four years down the track hopefully growing. Who knows, there might even be more teams in the MLC by then. I think it also gives cricket a chance to break into the grassroots level in the US.\n\n“But the thing about the Olympic Games, I mean, it’s not the host nation. It’s about the audience that it opens up.\n\n“The Olympic Games being viewed by so many people all around the world, it just opens up completely different audiences to our game that’s seemingly growing on a daily basis anyway. It can only be a real positive thing for the game.\n\n“Facilities and infrastructure and those things are going to be key and how many teams they actually decide on. I think it’s only six or seven teams that they’re talking about, so qualification is going to be at a premium, how you actually qualify to get into the Olympic Games.\n\n“So all those things to think about, I’m really excited about where the game’s headed and the growth of different markets that we’re seeing emerge.“\n\nPonting has baulked at any full-time coaching roles with the Australian team but has done tours as an assistant and mentor.\n\nHaving experienced the Commonwealth Games in 1998, when 50-over matches were played, he added getting to the Olympics was on his wish list.\n\n“It’d be a pretty nice job, I reckon, to be a mentor around a cricket team in the Olympic Games, to hang out,” Ponting told the ICC review.\n\n“I was lucky enough to play in the Commonwealth Games and just to be around the athletes in the villages and stuff was quite a surreal environment to be in for a cricketer.\n\n“So, look, I wouldn’t say no, but I think there’ll be a lot of people putting their hands up to try and be a mentor or a coach for an Aussie team in the Olympic Games.\n\n“It’d be special to be a part of, so who knows?

The Major League Cricket (MLC), the first T20 franchise league in the country which boasts of several journeyman stars, got underway in Dallas on Thursday, July 13, while in August, a set of marquee Indian names headlined by Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh will be seen in action in Raleigh, North Carolina for the US Masters T10 League.\n\nPlaying catch-up will be neighbours Canada, who are going to revive their Global T20 Canada from July 20 after a gap of three years. There will be a feel of the ‘real thing’ in between when India and the West Indies, now in the middle of a Test series, will be playing two back-to-back T20 Internationals at Lauderhill in the US on August 12-13.\n\nThe surfeit of franchise cricket that is on offer is expected to serve as an appetiser for the T20 World Cup in 2024, which will feature some Cup matches for the first time in the US when they co-host the event with the West Indies. It’s after a gap of more than 15 years that the Caribbean islands will be hosting a major ICC event after the 2007 World Cup.\n\n“I see myself, in 10 or 15 years, coming into American sports and you can see (what) the American feel watching the game of cricket, which is unique to anywhere else in the world,” remarked Faf du Plessis, captaining the Texas Super Kings, ahead of their game against Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium which kicked off the MLC.\n\nThe six captains in attendance for the Media Day are personalities who have been there, done that in the world of franchise cricket and IPL. While the credentials of Du Plessis, currently captaining the Royal Challengers Bangalore and his records with Chennai Super Kings speak for itself, the others are Kieron Pollard (MI New York), Sunil Narine (Los Angeles Knight Riders), Aaron Finch (San Francisco Unicorns), Wayne Parnell (Seattle Orcas) and Moises Henriques (Washington Freedom).\n\nPollard, currently a batting coach for five-time champions Mumbai Indians but leading their US franchise in action here, said: “From an MI perspective, we look at new talent and are able to scout those international players when we look at it and go around the world in each tournament - the most important people are the domestic talent.”\n\nThere is a surfeit of big names taking part in MLC including Afghanistan’s T20 captain Rashid Khan, Pakistan’s Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf, South African David Miller (apart from Du Plessis), West Indians Andre Russell, Narine and Pollard, Australians Marcus Stoinis and Finch, England’s Jason Roy and New Zealand’s Trent Boult.\n\nThe mushrooming of franchise leagues has invited it’s share of critics, but the shorter the format – the greater seems to be it’s appeal for the diaspora living in that part of the world. This is what prompted the birth of the US Masters League in T10 format, which had grown in stature from it’s humble origins in the UAE in 2017. The trio of India’s 2011 World Cup winning squad – Gambhir, Yuvraj and Yusuf Pathan will turn out for New Jersey Legends there while there will be other big Indian names who have recently retired from international cricket.\n\nHere are a few samplers: Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan and Mohammed Kaif will play for California Knights; Harbhajan Singh, Parthiv Patel for Morrisville Unity; Robin Uthappa for Atlanta Fire; Munaf Patel for New York Warriors.

    "title": "Major League Cricket Is Luring the World’s Top Stars to the U.S.",
    "date": "Wed Jul 31 12:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Australian bowler Pat Cummins made his debut in Major League Cricket’s second season, which wrapped July 28. The international star, whom Wisden, the English cricketing bible, lists as the leading player in the world, is one of the few athletes with such a broad skill set that he can excel at all three of the sport’s codes: five-day Test matches, one-day games, and the three-hour Twenty20 format played in MLC.\n\nCummins, like many of the game’s best, has his pick of any league, and can set his own schedule; he has recently limited his appearances to international matches for Australia and a roughly $2.4 million annual deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League (IPL)—by far the highest-quality and best-paid T20 league in the world.\n\nIn recent years Cummins has shunned playing in any of the other national T20 competitions that litter the cricket calendar. He has not even competed in the Australian tournament, known as the Big Bash, since 2017. That’s why Cummins’s two-year deal to play for the San Francisco Unicorns was a particular coup for MLC—a relatively small U.S. league with a draw that pales in comparison to overseas leagues, based in a country that still lacks international-standard facilities. His agreement with MLC, inked in June, saw Cummins play in the U.S. before any of MLC’s closest rivals, such as The Hundred in England or SA20 in South Africa.\n\nHe’s just one of the many outstanding overseas cricketers who have landed in the U.S. “We’re ecstatic with the international players we signed up,” says Justin Geale, tournament director of Major League Cricket. “We’ve got some of the best players in the world.”\n\nTalent keeps trickling in from overseas leagues in part because MLC can lay out cash—and other opportunities—in a way some overseas leagues simply can’t. Even as a start-up league in a sport where salaries are relatively low, international stars defecting to the U.S. are finding themselves with paydays that spell earnings they never would have gotten in even some of the world’s biggest leagues.\n\nCricket rosters in the U.S. are increasingly loaded. Cummins (below) joined other outstanding overseas cricketers, including Trinidadian all-rounder Kieron Pollard and South African wicket-keeper batsman Heinrich Klaasen.\n\nThis year, the league has also attracted three key Australians: Steve Smith, a former national team captain; young batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk; and Travis Head, the star of the recent T20 World Cup held in the U.S. and the Caribbean. Add New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra and South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada, and the MLC has jumped ahead of its rivals—The Hundred, in particular—in the race for talent.\n\nIt’s extraordinary that athletes favored the second season of a cricket competition in the U.S. ahead of a tournament held in England, the sport’s historic home. But money talks.\n\nGeale tells Front Office Sports that each of MLC’s six teams has a cap of $1.15 million to hire a squad of between 15 and 18 players. Of this total, $320,000 can be spent on domestic cricketers and $830,000 on up to nine overseas stars. (This is pocket change compared with the wages on offer in the IPL, but noteworthy relative to everywhere else.)\n\nAt the draft for domestic players, first-round picks earned $75,000—but international stars have the potential to earn much more. For example, the Unicorns maxed out their allocation of overseas players in 2024, so if each of the other eight earned the same as the top-earning domestic players, the team would have $230,000 left for Cummins. Exact figures aren’t disclosed, but for the highest-shelf players who will certainly command more than the best domestic players, their earnings for this short stint are highly competitive with—often better than—The Hundred, where the top salary band for domestic and international players is £125,000 (around $160,000).\n\nThese paychecks have left other leagues scrambling. The fourth season of The Hundred, which began July 23, was missing around half of its overseas players because they were involved in MLC. For this year, MLC’s fixture list overlaps with The Hundred by six days. This has forced English franchises to rush to sign players on one-match deals to cover those players still involved in the U.S.\n\n“We’re not here to destroy world cricket,” Geale says. “But for a long time, England has had that summer window to itself by virtue of being in a different hemisphere. If you look at the English winter, you have Australia, South Africa, and India all competing in that space. So, I think some competition [for players] in the summer was inevitable.”\n\nMLC also made an important strategic decision early on that has helped it to draw in overseas players. Before its debut season in 2023, it accepted investment from four of the Indian enterprises that run teams in the IPL. This brought in considerable operational experience, but also demystified MLC for some of the players the league was seeking to attract.\n\n“The players had preexisting relationships with owners, coaches, and support staff, so they could immediately feel comfortable in what is essentially a new tournament,” explains Dan Weston, an English cricket consultant who has worked with franchise teams in The Hundred and the IPL. The New York franchise, which is run by the same operation as the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, includes three overseas players—Tim David of Australia, Dewald Brevis of South Africa, and Romario Shepherd of the West Indies—who play for Mumbai in India.\n\nMLC has been so successful in luring international talent that The Hundred is likely to make changes to catch up.\n\nThe Hundred’s eight teams are currently owned and operated by the England and Wales Cricket Board. This decision means the ECB has complete operational control over the tournament. The ECB also receives all of The Hundred’s revenue. However, this model also puts a ceiling on salaries and prevents the sort of international links that have brought foreign stars to MLC.\n\nThe ECB has secured the approval of the English domestic teams to sell 49% stakes in all Hundred franchises to private investors later this year. Although the ECB has spoken of investing proceeds from the sales into the domestic game and recreational cricket, its major goal is to prevent The Hundred from being outflanked by other competitions, including MLC. An ECB spokesman told FOS, “The global cricketing landscape is highly competitive and that is why we are working to ensure we can attract the best overseas players along with retaining the best English talent.”\n\nThat the ECB is playing catchup to a nascent U.S. league is remarkable. “We certainly have not taken first-mover advantage on private investment,” admitted the ECB’s chief executive, Richard Gould, in a recent interview with The Cricketer. Weston, meanwhile, believes the arrival of private investment would enable the ECB to raise salaries “markedly,” eroding MLC’s current superiority.\n\nYet for all the effort, other leagues may struggle to replicate some of the factors that help MLC draw in overseas stars.\n\n“A lot of the guys see opportunities off the field, as well for their post-cricket careers,” Geale tells FOS. “There is a certain fascination about the American sports market. It is incredibly sophisticated. The brands are big, and they do it really well.”\n\nWhen announcing his deal with the Unicorns, Cummins noted the “long-term” appeal of building links to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Cricket does not yet have the culture of veteran players investing in sports properties, but it is possible that Cummins’s generation could take the first exploratory steps.\n\nAnd even without players without strategic plans, a month in the States is simply an enjoyable time. “Everyone wants to go to the U.S. and see the country,” says Cameron Gannon, an Australian-born bowler who has played in both seasons of MLC. “It’s a huge tourist destination, and the league is a great way to make that happen.”\n\nAs they jostle for the sport’s best players, both MLC and The Hundred have expansion plans. Geale says MLC wants to add another two teams in 2026 and even more beyond that, provided it can build some more grounds to host matches. And across the pond, part of the ECB’s pitch to its potential investors is the opportunity to add more games to its fixture list.\n\nAlthough Geale believes “there is no reason why MLC and The Hundred cannot live nicely together,” future schedule clashes seem likely, necessitating that the leagues will continue to go head-to-head to host the world’s best players.\n\nAs for Cummins, the Unicorns were well beaten in Sunday’s final by Washington Freedom. Nevertheless, the Aussie skipper took the wickets of countrymen Head and Smith and smote two big sixes in a batting cameo of 13 runs off seven balls. A runners-up spot for Cummins and the chance to learn from one of the best players in the game means that both player and team will consider his contract to be money well spent.",
    "summary": "**Debut of Pat Cummins and Overseas Stars**: Australian bowler Pat Cummins made his debut in MLC's second season, which concluded on July 28. Cummins, one of the world's top cricketers, is part of a growing list of international stars who have joined MLC, including Kieron Pollard, Heinrich Klaasen, Steve Smith, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, and Kagiso Rabada.\n\n**Talent Acquisition**: MLC has outbid rival leagues, such as The Hundred in England, to attract top talent. The league's ability to offer competitive salaries, with each team having a $1.15 million cap, and its strategic partnership with Indian IPL teams have helped lure overseas players.\n\n**Salary Structure**: Each team has a $830,000 allocation for up to nine overseas players, with top stars potentially earning more than the top salary band of £125,000 (around $160,000) in The Hundred.\n\n**Competition with The Hundred**: The success of MLC has forced The Hundred to make changes, with plans to sell 49% stakes in its teams to private investors to increase salaries and attract more international talent.\n\n**Expansion Plans**: MLC aims to add two more teams in 2026 and build more grounds to host matches, while The Hundred plans to expand its fixture list.\n\n**Future of the League**: The competition between MLC and The Hundred is expected to continue, with schedule clashes likely in the future. However, MLC's tournament director, Justin Geale, believes that both leagues can coexist and attract top talent.",

    "date": "Wed Jul 31 12:03:33 2024",
    "body": "As Major League Cricket (MLC) completed its second season in July 2024, the league has emerged as an exciting platform for international players while also posing a significant challenge: engaging local youth to ensure cricket’s long-term viability in the United States.\n\nOne of the standout moments this season was Oregon-born Sanjay Krishnamurthi, a 21-year-old computer science student, who hit the winning run for his San Francisco Unicorns, scoring 79 off 42 balls in a thrilling match against Washington Freedom on July 22. This victory not only marked Washington’s first loss of the season but also highlighted the potential for USA-born cricketers to enrich the local sports landscape, laying the groundwork for a vibrant future for cricket in America. Including talented local cricketers in MLC teams will be crucial for the league’s success in the coming years.\n\nHowever, what truly fills the stands at sports venues? It could be the electric atmosphere, the star power of elite athletes, or the intense rivalries that captivate fans. More importantly, fans’ deep emotional bond with their teams keeps them returning. Take the Chicago Cubs in Baseball and their devoted supporters at Wrigley Field or the sold-out crowds cheering for Michael Jordan at the United Center. Currently, Major League Cricket operates with just two venues hosting six teams, which poses a challenge for fans looking to forge a personal connection with their teams. The absence of a home-and-away structure further complicates this relationship, leaving fans yearning for greater engagement and loyalty.\n\nREAD | A second coming for their second home in the T20 World Cup 2024\n\nBuilding that vital fan-team camaraderie remains an uphill battle. With two teams based in California and another in Washington, the lack of dedicated West Coast stadiums hampers local support development. Once the infrastructure is established, proper home-and-away matches can foster deeper connections. However, as the tournament continues to grow over the years, a positive momentum is building. Players are beginning to consider their long-term affiliations, such as Harmeet Singh, the left-arm spinner with roots in the Seattle franchise who has shown his commitment to the team coached by Pravin Amre.\n\nTake, for instance, Pat Cummins, the exceptional Australian bowler who recently signed a four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns, backed by tech entrepreneurs Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan. Cummins strategically aligns his passion for cricket with smart investments for his future, illustrating how players can merge their athletic careers with opportunities that pave the way for long-term success. The United States, often dubbed the land of opportunity, may represent the perfect paradigm for this new venture.\n\nSo far, six teams have participated in MLC’s first two seasons, with four teams from IPL franchises playing integral roles in team management. With the proposed expansion on the horizon, it’s only a matter of time before other IPL teams are interested in the newer MLC expansion teams.\n\nSanjay Parthasarathy, the operating partner and co-owner of the Seattle Orcas, shares his insights with Sportstar on what needs to happen for cricket to thrive in the USA: grassroots development in schools, colleges, and communities; a winning USA national team and appropriate infrastructure. He noted that the USA team’s success in reaching the Super 8 stages of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 has sparked heightened interest and awareness. The Seattle Orcas is actively investing in grassroots initiatives, emphasising, “Building a new location for cricket in the US will take a while. We are moving in the right trajectory with accelerated speed.”\n\nWhen asked about the potential for other IPL teams to join, he remarked, “The first movers in the IPL moved quickly. Based on other T20 leagues, we should expect Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, and Lucknow Super Giants to show interest. All this will depend on the expansion of the MLC, which remains to be seen.”\n\nIn terms of cricket-related excitement, the league has not disappointed. The challenger match between Texas and San Francisco reached a thrilling climax when the Texas Super Kings needed 18 runs off the final over. It faced the formidable Pat Cummins, whose exceptional skill with yorkers proved decisive, ultimately humbling the Super Kings and securing a memorable victory to reach the finals of MLC season 2. While the cricketing entertainment factor has been abundant, the fervent support from loyal fans has been lacking, highlighting a critical area for growth in cultivating dedicated team followings. In the finals of the 2024 MLC, Washington Freedom was led by Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell to provide them with a thumping win over San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nForeign players have also capitalised on the opportunities presented by MLC. Pakistan’s young all-rounder Hassan Khan made the most of his chances this season, citing the benefits of playing in the league.",

    "date": "Thu Aug  1 11:45:01 2024",
    "body": "By Chaithanya G\n\nPublished: Thursday, August 1, 2024, 11:45 [IST]\n\nlekhaka-Chaithanya g\n\nNew Zealand international Finn Allen caught the attention of many with his batting exploits in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. The dynamic New Zealand opener set the tournament on fire by playing with intent.\n\nThe 25-year-old who played for San Fransisco Unicorns, finished MLC 2024 as the fourth-highest leading run-getter with 306 runs in nine games at an average of 34, including 1 century and 2 fifties. Moreover, he maintained a sensational strike rate of 187.73, the most by a batter in the tournament. He hasn't played in the Indian Premier League so far. He registered his name at the IPL 2024 auction for his base price of INR 75 lakh.\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to attract the bids at the auction. Nevertheless, he made a real case for himself as an aggressive batter in the recently-concluded MLC 2024 tournament, which strengthened his resume by a notch, making him a most-wanted asset for any T20 team. Let's take a glimpse at the three teams that will go after Finn Allen in the upcoming auction.\n\n1. Sunrisers Hyderabad: The 2016 IPL champions could benefit immensely from Finn Allen’s batting style. The cricket community saw the Sunrisers setting new records in the last season as the players adopted ultra-aggressive batting approach, which helped them record humongous totals. The IPL 2024 runners-up might show a great deal of interest to sign the New Zealander since he possesses all the qualities to accelerate the scoring rate.\n\n2. Chennai Super Kings: The five-time IPL champions purchased Rachin Ravindra for INR 1.8 crore at the previous auction. Unfortunately, the signing turned out to be an utter flop as he hardly upped his game as an opener. CSK who failed to qualify for the playoffs last season might offload Rachin Ravindra in an attempt to rope in fellow New Zealander Fin Allen as a long term investment. CSK might benefit from Allen's explosive stroke play in the powerplay overs.\n\n3. Gujarat Titans: The Ahmedabad-based franchise won the trophy in their debut season in IPL 2022. In the subsequent season, they failed to defend the title before surrendering at the hands of Chennai Super Kings in the final. However, they failed to qualify for the playoffs in IPL 2024 by finishing eighth on the points table. After a forgettable campaign, GT might try to sign quality players at the auction. If they manage to sign Finn Allen, he would bolster their lineup and enhance the team's chances of dominating the league.\n\nGet breaking news alerts.\n\nAllow Notifications\n\nOther articles published on Aug 1, 2024",

    "title": "Pat Cummins opens up on his decision to take a 2",
    "date": "",
    "body": "Australia Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins revealed the reason behind his decision to take a two-month hiatus from cricket. The pace bowler will be prepping himself for the upcoming five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against India later this year.\n\nCummins, who recently completed his debut in Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States, has been given a vacation from Australia's limited-overs tour of the United Kingdom next month.\n\nThis choice was taken to properly manage his workload while also allowing him to focus on his physical training in preparation for a busy summer.\n\n\"Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it. I've basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, and then I start building up again for the summer. It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, makes you less susceptible to injuries,” Cummins told Fox Sports.\n\nSince 2023, Cummins has had a hectic schedule in international and league cricket. He started with an ODI series against India, the ICC World Cup win, three Test matches against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour in New Zealand, two Test matches against New Zealand, the IPL 2024, the T20 World Cup 2024, and the MLC tournament.\n\n\"I'm very sore today after a week of the gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can't really nail it while you're in the midst of the season. I'll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can't really fit in the middle of the season,” he added.\n\nIndia will play a five-Test series in Australia for the first time since 1992. Australia has not won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy since 2017, with India winning four consecutive times. This includes their remarkable successes in Australia during the 2018-19 and 2020-21 tours.\n\nAs the captain, Cummins is determined to lead his team to victory and claim the trophy on home soil this season.\n\n\"It's the trophy I haven't won before... this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven't ticked off. We've achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\nThat's what lies ahead of us this summer. They (India) are a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" he added.\n\nCummins has no plans to retire from Twenty20 cricket in the immediate future. He hopes to help Australia win a gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, which will include cricket for the first time in the event's history.\n\n\"Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle. I'd love to be on that side (at LA 2028). I think I'll be 35 or something, so hopefully still there or thereabouts. Honestly, right now, it feels a long way away. Maybe once we get closer and start building into it, everyone gets a bit more excited,\" he concluded.",

Known for his crucial centuries in the 2023 World Test Championship and the 2023 ODI World Cup finals against India, Head has solidified his reputation as a reliable match-winner. His recent exploits in the IPL and Major League Cricket (MLC) further underscore his exceptional form.\n\nOver the past year, Head has shown remarkable consistency across multiple tournaments. He played a key role in Australia's triumphs in two major ICC events. Head’s recent form has been equally impressive, marked by a stellar IPL season with Sunrisers Hyderabad and a strong showing in the 2024 T20 World Cup.\n\nIn the ODI World Cup final, Head's magnificent 137 runs were pivotal in securing Australia’s sixth title, making him the seventh batter to score a century in an ODI World Cup final. His calm and composed approach in high-pressure situations speaks volumes about his mental toughness.\n\n\"I think in terms of the big matches, just staying nice and calm and relaxed and knowing that my game was in good order helped. I didn't try to overthink things or worry too much about the scenario or the situation or the things that are riding on it,\" Head said.\n\nReflecting on his approach, Head emphasized the importance of not overthinking and focusing on his game.\n\n\"Just going out and playing another game of cricket was the thought process. It was nice to play a semi-final and have two days and then play again,\" he further added.\n\nIn the 2024 IPL season, Head scored 567 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad at a remarkable strike rate of 191.55. His excellent form continued in the T20 World Cup, where he was the third-highest run-scorer with 255 runs.

Due to the current unrest, he is unlikely to return to Bangladesh anytime soon.\n\nIt remains unclear whether his political identity would impact his selection in the national team. According to sources, Shakib's fitness for red-ball cricket is also a concern as he has been playing non-stop T20 matches since the home series against Zimbabwe in May.\n\n\"Before it was just about whether he [Shakib] could come to Bangladesh and then travel to Pakistan. He's been playing cricket but in a format where he has to score quickly in short time. And even though he knows how to play longer matches, there's a concern about whether he can handle the physical demands [of Test cricket],\" a BCB official told The Daily Star yesterday.\n\nThe selectors, who were unable to contact Shakib over the past week due to unrest situation, are likely to sit with skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in one or two days regarding the matter and other issues about the squad for the Pakistan Test series before they announce their final squad.\n\nIt was learned from another source that BCB has already formed an 18-member preliminary squad with Shakib and pacer Taskin Ahmed being in the team, but the final 15-member squad will be decided after the meeting with all the members of the selection panel, which had to be deferred a few times due to the current unrest situation.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, Cricket Operation In-charge Shahriar Nafees informed that Shakib's inclusion in the Test squad depends both on his availability and selection.\n\n\"He is only a cricketer now,\" Nafees told reporters in Mirpur. \"There is a question of whether he is available for the series now, and another being whether he gets picked for the tour.

From his heroic centuries in the 2023 World Test Championship and 2023 ODI World Cup finals against India to his recent exploits in the IPL and Major League Cricket, the southpaw's performances have been nothing short of spectacular.\n\nIn the past year, Head has been consistent across multiple tournaments. The left-hand batter was instrumental in Australia's victories in both major ICC events. Head's recent form has been equally impressive, with a stellar IPL season for Sunrisers Hyderabad and a strong performance in the 2024 T20 World Cup.\n\nHe smashed a magnificent 137 which helped Australia secure thier sixth ODI World Cup, becoming the seventh batter to score a century in an ODI World Cup final. Head's approach in important matches reveals much about his mental toughness.\n\n\"I think in terms of the big matches, just staying nice and calm and relaxed and knowing that my game was in good order helped. I didn't try to overthink things or worry too much about the scenario or the situation or the things that are riding on it,\" Head told exclusively to SportsBoom.com.\n\nAlso read: Peter Handscomb opens up on batting with Ajinkya Rahane\n\nIt was nice to play a semi-final: Travis Head\n\nThe 30-year-old emphasised the importance of not overthinking or worrying excessively and insteadfocuses on his game and leaves the broader strategy to the team leadership.\n\n\"Just going out and playing another game of cricket was the thought process. It was nice to play a semi-final and have two days and then play again,\" Head added.\n\nAlso read: Vikram Rathour reacts to doctored pitch allegations in ODI World Cup final\n\nIn the 2024 IPL season, he scored 567 runs for SRH at a remarkable strike rate of 191.55.

However, Indian fans quickly embraced him when he played for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the IPL 2024, where he dazzled with a strike rate of around 200.\n\nHaving spent significant time in India recently, Head shared his thoughts on Indian culture after participating in his first Major League Cricket (MLC) season. Reflecting on the World Cup final and the IPL, he appreciated the warm reception from Indian fans both on and off the field.\n\n\"The most enjoyable thing about India is how friendly everyone is, how well we get looked after, the hotels we stay in. There are some amazing places to eat and see, and there's a couple of really good golf courses to get away. We're very fortunate when we're there to be very well looked after,” Head said.\n\nHead also praised the passionate crowds and impressive venues in India.\n\n“Obviously, the crowds and the venues that we play are outstanding as well, but there's a fair due away from the game as well if we want to or just chill. It's always a great experience being in India,” he further added.\n\nAfter his stint in the IPL, Head transitioned to his debut season in Major League Cricket, playing for Washington Freedom. He expressed his enjoyment of the experience in the United States, particularly appreciating the camaraderie with both international and local players.\n\n“Love my time over here in the MLC first year. Some nice overseas players for the Washington team but also some guys like Saurabh (Netravalkar) and Andries (Gous), who are the locals that I've really enjoyed meeting and playing with. The first year, it's been great fun,\" he concluded.",

He had planned to return to Bangladesh from the USA, where he had been playing in the Major League Cricket, following his NOC from the BCB until August 12.\n\nHowever, Shakib’s situation has changed after he lost his parliamentary seat on August 6 due to the recent political unrest, which may delay his return to Bangladesh. This uncertainty could potentially affect his selection for the national team. Furthermore, there are concerns about Shakib's readiness for Test cricket, given his recent continuous T20 matches since the home series against Zimbabwe in May.\n\nAccording to a report by The Daily Star, a BCB official mentioned that the initial concern was whether Shakib could travel to Bangladesh and then Pakistan, but now there are worries about his ability to handle the physical demands of Test cricket after playing T20s. The selectors have struggled to reach Shakib over the past week due to the unrest and are expected to consult with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in the coming days before finalizing the squad.",

The 2nd edition of the league ended with the Washington Freedom defeating the San Francisco Unicorns on July 29.\n\nThe league is expected to increase the popularity of cricket in the USA and also raise the quality of their national cricket team. But the second edition was a glow-down compared to the first one, and Sunil Gavaskar isn’t happy with that.\n\nGavaskar, who is also a former legendary cricketer, felt that the cricket this time lacked quality. The decrease in the crowd might also be due to “fatigue as the USA hosted the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 along with the West Indies.” Gavaskar was talking to The Sportster.\n\n“The crowd was not there this time. Maybe it was due to fatigue, as the USA hosted the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 along with the West Indies. The cricket also lacked quality. There were ordinary players in the franchises. The international stars were also a little casual,” Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar.\n\nSunil Gavaskar Wants Players in 2 More Leagues With IPL\n\nGavaskar also opined that the cricketer ‘should be restricted to three leagues of their choice’.\n\n“Nobody wants the cricketers’ source of income to decrease, but I feel players should be restricted to three leagues of their choice. IPL is the best tournament in the world, and the players should be allowed to choose other T20 tournaments,” he added.\n\nMany of the foreign players are playing in multiple leagues in different countries. This sometimes leads to a situation in which some players sign multiple franchises owned by different owners. It’s a bit odd for the commentator to see players who wear the ‘jersey of a rival IPL franchise in other leagues’.\n\n“Players are playing for one franchise in the IPL and turning up for the rival IPL franchise in the other leagues. It is understandable if the franchise they compete for in the IPL doesn’t have a team in the other T20 leagues, but it is odd to see them wearing the jersey of a rival IPL franchise in other leagues,” he concluded.\n\nThe Indian cricketers who are under the BCCI central contract currently are not allowed to play in any other foreign leagues than IPL.",

He then took on the role of head coach for Washington Freedom and led them to victory in the Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nWhile Ponting remains enthusiastic about coaching in the IPL and other leagues, he is not currently interested in taking on a role with any international team. Instead, he is keen to continue his association with an IPL franchise.\n\n“I’d love to coach again in the IPL,” he stated, as quoted by ICC.\n\nThe legendary batter, Ricky Ponting ruled out the possibility of taking up the job as England men’s team white-ball coach following departure of Matthew Mott, saying that international cricket jobs are not for him considering where he is at in his life right now.\n\nPonting turned down approaches from England to coach their Test side prior to Kiwi Brendon McCullum accepting the job, and the Australia legend recently finished a seven-year tenure in charge of the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League, as per ICC.\n\nHe reflected on his time in the IPL, recalling his playing days and his subsequent coaching stint with the Mumbai Indians. During his coaching tenure, he played a key role in helping the team win the title in 2015.\n\nMUST READ: Mumbai Hijab Row: SC Stays Implementation Of Hijab Ban At College ‘Will You…\n\n“I’ve had a great time every year that I’ve been involved, whether that was in the early days as a player or the couple of years I had at Mumbai as head coach there.\n\nAnd then I’ve had seven seasons at Delhi, which unfortunately didn’t really work out the way that I would have wanted and certainly the way that the franchise would have wanted. I think me going there was all about trying to bring some silverware to the team and that didn’t happen,” Ricky Ponting said.\n\nPonting reflected on his seven seasons with Delhi, noting that things didn’t turn out as well as he or the franchise had hoped.\n\nHe explained that his aim in joining the team was to win a title, but he was unable to achieve that goal.\n\nHe expects that Delhi will appoint someone local for the head coach position.\n\n“They made it pretty clear that they wanted to head in a different direction with someone that could give them a bit more time and a bit more availability through the off-season, really more than anything to be able to spend a bit more time in India with a lot of the local players.\n\nI just couldn’t do that with the other stuff that I’ve got going on,” the former world champion said.\n\n“But I’m really thankful for my time that I had there, met some great people, worked with some great people and obviously worked with some great players through the years as well.\n\nEver since Ponting’s appointment as a coach in 2018, when the franchise was called Delhi Daredevils, Delhi qualified for the playoffs thrice, in 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\nIn fact, in the 2020 season, DC made it to the finals for the first-time ever, but lost to the Mumbai Indians (MI).\n\nHowever, for the last three years, DC has failed to progress to the final four stages.\n\nThis year, the franchise finished in the sixth spot, narrowly missing out on the playoffs on the basis of net-run-rate.

But the future is expected to be exciting in his coaching.\n\nRicky Ponting in talks with IPL teams to be new head coach\n\nIn the recent episode of the ICC review with host Sanjana Ganesan, Ricky Ponting revealed his wish not to consider the white-ball coaching of the England team, as he is looking forward to being part of the IPL and other various leagues around the world in coaching frame.\n\nAlso Read: India Seen As Potential Venue For Women’s T20 World Cup 2024 Due To Unrest In Bangladesh\n\n“No, I wouldn’t ever consider doing that.

He is going to be in the commentary box when Australia tours England in the upcoming white-ball series.\n\n“I‘ve got other commitments as well, with my TV work and things that I do and also trying to balance that out with having a decent amount of home time, which I haven’t had much of the last couple of years anyway.” The former Australian head coach Ricky Ponting shared his thoughts. “Coaching other international teams is one thing, coaching England for an Australian is probably something slightly different, but right now there’s sort of enough on my plate as I’ve got a bit more coming up in the next couple of months in the UK.”\n\nThe 49-year-old is looking forward to being part of another franchise in the IPL, and it could be Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), who lost their head coach Gautam Gambhir, who became the new coach for the Indian team.\n\n“I‘d love to coach again in the IPL.

Interestingly, Cummins holds a little-known dominance over his Test vice-captain, dismissing Smith each time they’ve faced in T20 matches. Their head-to-head record is 4 wickets for 8 runs from 13 balls, all occurring outside Australia.\n\nThe MLC, a two-year-old tournament in a non-Test playing nation, has achieved something Australia’s T20 league has not. “Being in America offers a new experience players are eager to have,” said Michael Klinger, Washington Freedom’s general manager. The short three-week tournament and proximity following the World Cup in America and the Caribbean add to its appeal.\n\nBeyond star power, this MLC campaign showcased an increasing Australian influence. Cricket NSW (CNSW) and Cricket Victoria (CV) took pride as Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns, both not affiliated with IPL groups, extended their high-performance programs to these teams. Klinger and Graham Manou, former CV GM, were involved, and the\n\nfranchises are backed by Indian and Indian-American tech entrepreneurs.\n\nAustralians dominated off-field roles, with Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson as head coaches and Aussie support staff. The final featured eight Australians, including tournament MVP Travis Head and final’s Player of the Match, Smith. American players from these teams experienced the Big Bash, enhancing their professionalism.\n\nCricket Australia’s involvement in MLC is under consideration, eyeing benefits for Australian cricket, especially with cricket returning to the Olympics in 2028. Next month’s KFC BBL draft may see American players like Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar join, marking a new chapter in the Australia-USA cricket relationship.\n\nDriving US cricket growth is its large south-Asian heritage population. The sell-out MLC final and high demand for the ICC World Cup highlight this interest. Ponting believes more grassroots promotion in the USA is needed, targeting young Americans and competing with baseball.\n\nThe MLC faces challenges with venue scarcity and the absence of a women’s league. However, it offers unique opportunities, drawing players like Cummins with Silicon Valley connections. Australian cricketers’ social media posts from the USA also serve as great advertisements for the tournament.\n\nKlinger believes the MLC has an edge over England’s Hundred competition. Keeping the tournament short and impactful will be crucial for maintaining its appeal and attracting top players.",

He underwent surgery on his back following the 2023 World Cup, but played throughout the 2024 T20 World Cup, as well as appearing in Major League Cricket and The Hundred. He was ruled out of the final part of his stint in The Hundred with a hamstring injury.\n\nHowever, having not played a Test match in three years, Rashid was set to return to the format in Afghanistan's one-off Test against New Zealand in India next month. Ahead of the series, Rashid returned to Afghanistan to take part in the Shpageeza League, which is the country's domestic T20 tournament.\n\nRashid played three matches for the Speen Ghar Tigers, all taking place on consecutive days, when he reportedly agitated his back injury.\n\nThe injury means his absence from the Test arena will continue, with the injury reportedly prompting Rashid to \"take a break\" from Test cricket. An ACB official reportedly told the Indian Express that Rashid has \"decided to take a break from Test cricket for one year\".\n\nAccording to the ICC's Future Tours Programme, Afghanistan are scheduled to play two Tests against Zimbabwe at the end of this year and a one-off Test against Ireland next July.\n\nRashid has taken 34 wickets across five Test matches in his career, and is Afghanistan's leading wicket-taker in the format. Seam-bowling all rounder Azmatullah Omarzai is likely to make his Test debut against New Zealand, with Hashmatullah Shahidi retaining his place as captain.

    "body": "LOS ANGELES: After a momentous T20 World Cup co-hosted by the US, marked by a $30 million cricket stadium in New York along with an underdog performance by the national team, hopes are high for a pivotal second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nThis year’s cricket tournament did receive significant exposure with coverage in media institutions like The New York Times, CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nNo one thinks it will become mainstream in the US but the sleeping giant -- with cricket by some metrics the second most popular sport in the world -- has finally awakened, reported international media. It came just before the much-anticipated second season of MLC, the lucrative professional T20 league in the US luring top players around the world.\n\nMLC has been able to secure major sponsorship deals, highlighted by Cognizant — a multinational information technology services and consulting company — becoming its first title sponsor. Salary caps for teams are to remain the same, but top players will still be handsomely remunerated and earn around $175,000 for a minimum of five games — rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nWhile Indian players are not allowed to play outside of the IPL, a slew of stars will play in this season’s MLC — many from Australia highlighted by San Francisco’s marquee signing of Pat Cummins to a four-year deal. Ahead of this season, MLC received official T20 league status with tournament playing records counted towards format statistics.\n\nWhile things are looking rosy in American cricket, there has been familiar warring behind the scenes with governing body USA Cricket amid continual turmoil after a spate of resignations and chief executive Dr. Noor Murad having his contract terminated earlier this year.\n\nUSA Cricket sanctions MLC, which is administered by American Cricket Enterprises after signing a 50-year commercial rights agreement in 2019. There are plans to expand MLC, with Chicago and Atlanta touted as possible new franchises amid a longer tournament earmarked to be played over much of June and July moving forward.\n\nThe 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup is done and dusted, ending the latest chapter of cricket’s onerous venture into the United States. America, where cricket has struggled to gain mainstream visibility for more than a century, hosted 16 of the tournament’s group-stage matches last month, while the remaining Super Eight games and knockouts took place in the Caribbean.\n\nThe T20 World Cup’s promotion through local media was headlined by a full-page advertisement in the New York Times that featured the Statue of Liberty raising a cricket bat. Olympic champion Usain Bolt opened the tournament at New York’s Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, a pop-up venue built specifically for the event, while former Indian all-rounder Yuvraj Singh appeared on NBC’s Good Morning America for a six-minute segment.\n\n“A lot of Americans are walking in and they’re asking questions about the sport,” Ali Zar, a cricket store owner in New York, told BBC Sport ahead of the tournament. “I was born in Pakistan, so I know about this sport. My kids are born here, other kids are born here. They are starting to ask questions about this sport.”\n\nMajor American publications, including Bleacher Report and CBS News, celebrated the win on their social media channels — the match headlined a segment on ESPN’s SportsCenter, while the New York Post and New York Times began featuring the T20 World Cup prominently on their websites. Even the White House took notice — National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby congratulated the American team after they qualified for the Super Eight stage, while US Senate majority leader Chuck tweeted about the “incredible upset” against Pakistan.\n\nMeanwhile, the Knight Riders Group (KRG), backed by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside actor Juhi Chawla and businessman Jay Mehta, is investing in a 10,000-capacity cricket stadium near Los Angeles. Located at a 15-acre land parcel in Great Park, Irvine, Southern California, some 40 miles from downtown Los Angeles, the plan is driven by Major League Cricket (MLC). The org has revealed that an exclusive negotiating agreement with the city of Irvine to move forward with lease negotiations and design approvals has been approved. The investment in the stadium is likely to be in the range of $30 million, Variety understands.\n\nKRG are owners of the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the lucrative Indian Premier League cricket tournament and Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League.",

Maybe it was due to fatigue as the USA hosted the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 along with the West Indies. The cricket also lacked quality. There were ordinary players in the franchises. The international stars were also a little casual,” Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar.\n\n“Nobody wants the cricketers’ source of income to decrease, but I feel players should be restricted to three leagues of their choice. IPL is the best tournament in the world, and the players should be allowed to choose other T20 tournaments,” he added.\n\nGavaskar also noted that players represent multiple franchises of different owners.\n\n“Players are playing for one franchise in the IPL and turning up for the rival IPL franchise in the other leagues.

The Freedom’s impressive victory highlighted their exceptional skills and teamwork, as they effectively outplayed the Unicorns to claim the title. Smith’s influence and the team’s overall excellence were key to their triumphant season.\n\nWashington Freedom Maiden Title Win Against San Francisco Unicorns:\n\nWashington Freedom clinched their first Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 title with a decisive 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. Glenn Maxwell‘s stellar batting performance played a key role, while Marco Jansen dismantled the Unicorns’ chase, claiming three wickets including both openers. This win solidified Freedom’s reputation as the standout team of the season.\n\nHaving secured five group stage victories and advancing directly to the final after beating the Unicorns in the Qualifier, Freedom’s dominant display continued. A crucial 83-run standoff 39 balls between Steven Smith and Maxwell helped them amass 121 runs in the latter part of their innings.\n\nSteven Smith overcame a slow start during the powerplay to score a robust 88 off 52 balls, including six sixes. After struggling with just 10 runs off 12 balls in the sixth over, he accelerated to a half-century off 34 balls. Smith ended the season as the joint second-highest run-scorer, tied with Travis Head, amassing 336 runs at a strike rate of 148.67. His innings gained momentum with Andries Gous’s support, although the match became tense when Haris Rauf dismissed Rachin Ravindra, leaving Freedom at 86 for 3.\n\nSmith and Glenn Maxwell then shifted the balance, with Maxwell finding his form towards the end of the season. They scored 28 runs in the 13th over against Juanoy Drysdale. Smith showcased his flair with a stunning scoop for six off Rauf and was approaching a century when he was dismissed by a top edge off Pat Cummins.\n\nSmith’s T20I career seems to be winding down after his World Cup omission and exclusion from the September squad facing Scotland and England, as selectors shift focus to emerging talent. Despite Maxwell’s dismissal by Josh Inglis in the next over, Freedom still managed to exceed 200 runs.\n\nThe Unicorns’ chase never gained momentum. Jake Fraser-McGurk’s underwhelming tournament ended when he was dismissed by Jansen, leaving him with just 81 runs at an average of 11.57. Both Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Allen fell during the powerplay, setting a challenging task. Sherfane Rutherford, after being dropped, was brilliantly caught by Ian Holland, and the rest of the batting collapsed under the mounting run rate.\n\nRicky Ponting About the Maiden Win:\n\nFreedom’s win awarded Ricky Ponting his first coaching title shortly after his exit from the Delhi Capitals. This achievement came just weeks after leaving his previous role, demonstrating Ponting’s ability to quickly make a mark in his new position. His successful transition underscores his coaching expertise and impact in leading Freedom to the MLC 2024 championship.\n\nRicky Ponting said, “ What a tournament for the Washington Freedom family!

    "body": "Washington Freedom won their maiden Major League Cricket title with a convincing win over the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas on Sunday. For the second consecutive year, we made it to the Playoffs, showing marked improvement from our loss in the Eliminator last year.\n\nThe team was very consistent this season, topping the points table throughout the league phase of the tournament. We lost just once in the course of nine matches, thanks to several clinical performances from our players.\n\nHere is a look at some of the best individual performances by our players this season.\n\nSteve Smith’s 88 off 52 balls vs SFU\n\nThere are many reasons why this knock against the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas stands at the top of the list. It was the final of MLC 2024, and the in-form Travis Head departed in the second over of the match.\n\nSkipper Steve Smith had to ensure that the scoring rate did not drop while also preventing further wickets from falling. He, along with Andries Gous, kept the scoreboard ticking, frequently finding boundaries.\n\nFrom 27 off 25 balls, Smith shifted gears to bring up his fifty in 34 balls. He scored 61 runs in his last 27 balls as we powered to 207/5, the highest total by any team this season.\n\nSmith added 83 runs with Glenn Maxwell from just 39 balls as we amassed 107 runs in the last eight overs of our innings. Smith had already set the base for a final flourish when he departed in the 17th over for a 52-ball 88, an innings laden with six sixes and seven fours. He deservedly won the Player of the Match award in the final after our 96-run win.\n\nTravis Head’s 77* off 44 balls vs SFU\n\nChasing 146 against the Unicorns in the Qualifier match in Dallas, Travis Head opened up in the third over after settling in. Head smashed three sixes and two fours to score 30 runs off Carmi le Roux’s two overs.\n\nWe raced to 52/1, with Head already on 41 off just 21 balls at the end of the powerplay. There was a quiet phase as we lost two wickets in the next three overs. However, Head returned to form once he reached his half-century, scoring boundaries at will.\n\nHead put together an unbeaten partnership of 85 off just 40 balls for the fourth wicket, making light work of the chase. The southpaw was unbeaten on 77 from 44 balls, with 10 fours and three sixes, as we romped home with a seven-wicket win with 27 balls to spare.\n\nRachin Ravindra 4/11 vs SFU\n\nRachin Ravindra picked up his career-best figures of 4/11 in T20 cricket in the Qualifier of MLC 2024 against San Francisco Unicorns at Dallas, which we won by seven wickets. Coming into the attack after the powerplay, Ravindra dismissed the dangerous Sanjay Krishnamurthi, the top-scorer in the last match between the two sides, off his third ball of the day.\n\nRavindra surprised Krishnamurthi with an arm ball that came in at pace, trapping him in front of the wicket. A wicket maiden to start with and he could not have asked for anything more.\n\nRavindra came back into the attack in the 18th over as Lockie Ferguson got injured after bowling two deliveries. He picked up two more off the next three balls as Haris Rauf holed out in the deep and Carmi le Roux found the timber disturbed.\n\nIn the last over, Ravindra outclassed Hassan Khan as he stepped out looking to force the pace and get some valuable runs. Ravindra bowled it wide and Hassan was caught short of his crease and had to walk back after top-scoring for the Unicorns with 57.\n\nLockie Ferguson 4/26 vs Seattle Orcas\n\nLockie Ferguson had a memorable spell against the Seattle Orcas in our group game at Dallas in MLC 2024 picking up 4/26 against them. Bowling the last over of the powerplay, Ferguson did not have an ideal start getting hit for a six and four in his first three balls.\n\nBut he came back strongly to dismiss Ryan Rickleton who was coming into this game after scoring an unbeaten century in his last match. In his next over, Ferguson bowled Quinton de Kock, who was looking in good nick, as the Orcas were reduced to 44/3.\n\nReturning to complete his spell during the death, Ferguson put the brakes on Orcas with a double strike in the 17th over. He beat the batters with his sheer pace as Imad Wasim nicked to the keeper and Hammad Azam was out leg before wicket.\n\nHe conceded just three runs in the over to finish with impressive figures of 4/26 in four overs. The Orcas were dismissed for 124 and we won the match by five wickets.",
    "summary": "**Team Performance:**\nWashington Freedom won their maiden MLC title by defeating San Francisco Unicorns in the final in Dallas on Sunday. The team was consistent throughout the season, topping the points table in the league phase and losing only one match out of nine.\n\n**Individual Performances:**\n\n* Steve Smith scored 88 off 52 balls in the final against San Francisco Unicorns, helping his team post the highest total of the season (207/5). He won the Player of the Match award.\n* Travis Head scored 77* off 44 balls in the Qualifier match against San Francisco Unicorns, helping his team win by seven wickets with 27 balls to spare.\n* Rachin Ravindra took career-best figures of 4/11 in the Qualifier match against San Francisco Unicorns, helping his team win by seven wickets.\n* Lockie Ferguson took 4/26 against Seattle Orcas in a group game, helping his team win by five wickets.",

His critical assessment highlighted potential issues within the tournament and suggested that despite the presence of renowned players, the competition did not meet the expectations set by its inaugural season.\n\n\"For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe, because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual,\" Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar.\n\nThe former Indian captain also highlighted the significant drop in crowd turnout for the tournament, which starkly contrasted with the enthusiastic attendance seen during the tournament's first edition.\n\n\"This makes one feel that while nobody wants the players’ source of income to be curbed, it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in, say, three leagues. The whole world agrees that the IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So maybe a player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice,\" he opined.\n\nGavaskar suggested that players should be limited to participating in only three T20 leagues in the world to maintain the high standards and competitiveness of the franchise tournaments.",

    "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 crown has found a new home in the nation’s capital, as the Washington Freedom stormed to victory in a one-sided final against the San Francisco Unicorns. Led by the imperious Steve Smith, the Freedom delivered a clinical performance to claim the inaugural championship. In a tournament marked by high-scoring encounters and thrilling finishes, the Freedom’s triumph was a testament to their exceptional talent and unwavering consistency. Their journey to the title was nothing short of spectacular, as they dominated the group stage and carried their momentum into the playoffs.\n\nWith Smith at the helm, the Freedom’s batting lineup was a formidable force. His ability to construct innings with calculated aggression and explosive power proved to be the difference-maker. The final was a showcase of his brilliance as he anchored the innings with a match-winning knock. However, the Freedom’s success was not solely reliant on Smith. The team boasted a deep batting order, with players like Glenn Maxwell providing crucial contributions. Their bowlers were equally impressive, executing their plans to perfection and stifling the opposition.\n\nThe Unicorns, despite their valiant efforts, were unable to match the Freedom’s intensity. A combination of factors, including a slow start and the inability to find their footing with the bat throughout, contributed to their defeat. Nevertheless, their participation in the final was a significant achievement and will undoubtedly serve as a platform for future success.\n\nAs the curtain falls on the second MLC season, the tournament has already established itself as a major force in the global cricket landscape. With its blend of high-quality cricket, star power, and entertainment, the MLC has captured the imagination of fans worldwide. The Washington Freedom’s championship-winning campaign will be remembered as a defining moment in the league’s history.\n\nSmith’s Stellar Knock\n\nSmith, who had been overlooked for Australia’s T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, silenced his critics with a match-winning performance. After a slow start, the right-hander exploded into life, showcasing his exceptional ability to clear the ropes with disdain. His innings of 88 off 52 balls, including six maximums, was a masterclass in T20 batting.\n\nA crucial partnership with Glenn Maxwell, who also contributed a valuable 40, propelled Freedom to a formidable total of 207 for 5. Smith’s knock not only propelled his team to victory but also solidified his reputation as one of the world’s premier T20 batsmen.\n\nAlso Read: Braithwaite’s Heroics in the 2016 T20 World Cup\n\nUnicorns’ Innings Collapse\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns faced an uphill battle from the outset, and their chase never truly gained momentum. Marco Jansen made early inroads, removing both openers, but the damage had already been done. The required run rate soared as wickets tumbled, and the Unicorns were unable to keep pace with the demanding target.\n\nFreedom’s bowling attack was relentless, with Jansen and Riley Meredith sharing six wickets between them. The Unicorns’ batting lineup, which had shown promise in previous matches, was completely outclassed on the big stage.\n\nA Fitting End to a Successful Campaign for Washington Freedom\n\nThe victory not only secured the MLC title for Washington Freedom but also marked a successful coaching stint for Ricky Ponting. The Australian legend, who recently stepped down as coach of the Delhi Capitals, ended his season on a high note.\n\nSmith’s exceptional performance and Freedom’s overall dominance have undoubtedly elevated the MLC to new heights. The tournament has showcased the immense talent on display in the United States and has laid the foundation for the growth of cricket in the country. As the league continues to expand, fans can expect even more thrilling contests and emerging stars in the years to come.",

    "body": "Subheading: 5,000% increase in Number of Bets\n\nThis is the second of a three-part series on groundbreaking partnerships secured for Major League Cricket’s 2024 season. In the first part we explored the deal with Lexus.\n\nGaming sponsors have become mainstream throughout the cricket world. From franchise tournaments, to national teams, to individual stars, it is hard not to see online gaming branding everywhere you turn.\n\nIn the midst of this ubiquity, however, Major League Cricket accomplished something new in 2024 on the gaming sponsorship front: attracting the largest online gaming company, Stake, into the cricket world.\n\nDiving headfirst into cricket\n\nDespite their size and stature, Stake had surprisingly not previously been involved in cricket.\n\nAccording to Dominic Rae, Sponsorship Manager for Stake, who managed the MLC relationship: “This year was really the first time we’ve made major moves in the cricket space. We partnered with Ravi Shastri and Major League Cricket (MLC) in two significant steps, and we have exciting plans to increase our presence in the coming years.”\n\nMonica Sadhu, MLC’s VP of Commercial Partnerships, who brokered the deal for the league,added: “Stake has been expanding its sports sponsorship portfolio worldwide. The timing was conducive to this alignment as their first investment in cricket through the partnership with Major League Cricket.”\n\nAttracted by quality\n\nSurprisingly, what attracted Stake to the MLC was not so much the US market itself, but the quality of the tournament.\n\nAs Rae says: “With the MLC partnership we weren’t so focused on the territory, but with the product, and in the inaugural MLC season in 2023 we were really impressed with the tournament and what the team behind it were able to achieve in such a short space of time.”\n\nStake was further attracted by the MLC’s vision and plans for the future: “In our initial conversations the ambition for growth was clear and resonated well with us, so it was a simple decision when the opportunity came to become an official partner.”\n\nMLC’s Sadhu agrees, and adds that a big part of the attraction to the MLC beyond the product comes from “the names behind it, and the investors on board, When you have majority owners of the likes of IPL powerhouses like KKR, CSK, and Mumbai Indians in addition to other serious investors such as Delhi Capitals and our local US ownership groups, it legitimizes the league and gives players and sponsors the confidence to participate.”\n\n5,000% growth\n\nSadhu said she was very confident that for a gaming company, a high-profile tournament sponsorship would deliver tremendous value. “Given the market size of the US combined with the MLC’s extensive global broadcast footprint, covering over 100 countries, we were sure that Stake would recoup its investment in the partnership very quickly.”\n\nStake’s Rae concurred, saying that the sponsorship performance exceeded Stake’s expectations. “We were delighted with the sponsorship this season… From a broadcast perspective our branding was highly prominent and accepted bets on MLC were up nearly 5,000% year-on-year, with betting turnover increasing by nearly 1,000%. By any standard that marks a successful sponsorship.”\n\nThe data speaks volumes\n\nGaming sponsors, given their unique vantage point and real time data about a global user base transacting on games, can provide a unique insight into the performance of a property overall.\n\nIndeed, Rae confirmed that their data showed that the MLC Season two was on a very strong upward trajectory.\n\n“We saw massive interest in MLC from many territories. MLC has a number of significant broadcast agreements worldwide, and with household names from many top international teams, as well as the ever improving domestic talent, it’s not surprising that it captured the attention of the global cricketing audience.”\n\nExcitement for the future\n\nA recurring theme throughout MLC Season 2 was the feeling that the tournament was ascending close to the top position in overall star power and quality of all franchise T20 tournaments, second only to the IPL.\n\nStake confirmed this.\n\n“Having attended the tournament finals in person I was hugely impressed with the stadium experience at Grand Prairie and the calibre of cricket on show… The calibre of play is a match for any T20 league outside of the IPL.”\n\nThis bodes well for the future of the MLC and its partnership with Stake. As Rae reiterated: “we are very excited for the journey we hope to continue with MLC.”\n\nSadhu concurred: “It’s been a fantastic partnership — as a client Stake were extremely easy to work with given our alignment, and we’ve been very happy with the association. The synergies were strong, and we look forward to continuing the partnership.”",
    "summary": "**Partnership with Stake**: MLC has secured a partnership with Stake, the largest online gaming company, for its 2024 season. This is a significant move in the gaming sponsorship space, marking Stake's first investment in cricket.\n\n**Attraction to MLC**: Stake was drawn to MLC due to the quality of the tournament, its vision for growth, and the impressive names behind it, including majority owners of IPL powerhouses like KKR, CSK, and Mumbai Indians.\n\n**Growth in Bets**: The partnership has resulted in a massive 5,000% increase in the number of bets placed, with betting turnover also increasing by nearly 1,000% year-on-year.\n\n**Global Reach**: MLC's global broadcast footprint, covering over 100 countries, has helped Stake reach a wider audience, with data showing massive interest in MLC from many territories.\n\n**Future Prospects**: The partnership has been deemed a success, with both parties excited to continue their collaboration.

    "date": "",
    "body": "Cricket fans witnessed yet another nail-biter as the San Francisco Unicorns edged out MI New York by just three runs at the Major League Cricket tournament on July 19. The game's excitement was palpable, and it showcased the thrilling nature of T20 cricket and what can happen when two competitive teams clash on the field.\n\nThe Unicorns initially batted first, struggling to build momentum as they stumbled at 148 runs, losing seven wickets over their 20 overs. This opening innings was marked by uncertainty, with several critical wickets falling at key moments. After establishing the foundation with their top order missing, the middle and lower orders had to scramble to salvage as many runs as possible.\n\nCorey Anderson stood out as the leading scorer for the Unicorns, contributing 47 runs from 32 balls. Anderson's innings included five fours and two sixes, which proved instrumental in keeping the score respectable. He, along with Pat Cummins, who smashed 28 runs off just 14 balls, gave the Unicorns the late push they desperately needed. Cummins' aggressive batting and windfall of runs helped breathe life back for the Unicorns as they looked to defend their score against MI New York.\n\nMI New York, armed with their own star players, walked onto the field confidently. Chasing 149 runs, they had the heavy hitters necessary for such tall orders. They quickly got to work, but the hopes of their fans were soon dealt severe blows. Early wickets fell to the Unicorns' impressive bowling lineup, leaving MI New York struggling at 41 runs with only three wickets to show at one point.\n\nDespite the shaky start, MI New York showed resilience and made brief comebacks at various stages, particularly through Heath Richards, who rallied to score 28 runs and included some thrilling moments as he smacked sixes and fours throughout his innings. Each run seemed to fuel the growing anticipation among the fans, but the mounting pressure and tight bowling soon began to take its toll.\n\nThe climax of the game unfolded under the dazzling lights, with MI New York's score teetering on the edge of victory. With just ten runs needed from the final over, the excitement turned electric. But the Unicorns' bowlers held their nerve. The last over encapsulated the drama of T20 cricket, as MI New York went from hopefuls to the brink of defeat. Last-minute wickets fell, and it all came down to one final delivery, needing just one run to tie. Alas, MI New York ended their innings at 145 runs, falling just short of taking the win.\n\nUnicorns' Rashid Khan played a critical role as their star bowler, snaring 4 wickets for just 32 runs across his four overs. His wicket-taking ability proved utterly destructive, particularly during the middle overs, which helped prevent MI New York from ever fully stabilizing their chase. Alongside Rashid, Romario Shepherd also shone with the ball, securing 2 wickets and maintaining pressure on the MI New York batters.\n\nThe crowd was entertained, and the match illustrated the entertainment and unpredictability of T20 cricket. Each ball delivered, each swing of the bat, and every catch taken contributed not just to the game but to the excitement radiated from the stadium. Fans knew they were part of something special, filled with adrenaline and suspense.\n\nDespite the heartbreak of narrowly losing, MI New York’s performance could not be dismissed. Their fight so deeply embedded the spirit of the game, and fans took heart knowing their team could have easily turned the tables with just one more good run. For the Unicorns, it's all about how they maintained focus and demonstrated key elements of composure, skill, and strategy at the critical moments.\n\nWhile both teams displayed moments of brilliance, the day undoubtedly belonged to the San Francisco Unicorns. Their victory serves as another reminder of the charm and unpredictability of cricket, especially within the thrilling structure of T20. The excitement is only meant to build up as the tournament progresses.\n\nLooking ahead, fans are eager to see how both teams will adjust and learn from their respective performances. Each match is not just about the scores but developing strategies and building momentum through the series. With every game, teams will aim to solidify their places and potentially head for the playoff rounds.",

    "body": "Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials are still uncertain about including premier all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan in their upcoming two-Test series against Pakistan. Shakib, who is currently participating in the Global T20 Canada, had previously shown interest in playing the Test series, which is set to begin on August 21 in Rawalpindi. He had planned to return to Bangladesh from the USA, where he had been playing in the Major League Cricket, following his NOC from the BCB until August 12.\n\nHowever, Shakib's situation has changed after he lost his parliamentary seat on August 6 due to the recent political unrest, which may delay his return to Bangladesh. This uncertainty could potentially affect his selection for the national team. Furthermore, there are concerns about Shakib's readiness for Test cricket, given his recent continuous T20 matches since the home series against Zimbabwe in May.\n\nAccording to a report by The Daily Star, a BCB official mentioned that the initial concern was whether Shakib could travel to Bangladesh and then Pakistan, but now there are worries about his ability to handle the physical demands of Test cricket after playing T20s. The selectors have struggled to reach Shakib over the past week due to the unrest and are expected to consult with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in the coming days before finalizing the squad.\n\nThe report further added that an 18-member preliminary squad has already been prepared, including Shakib and pacer Taskin Ahmed, but the final 15-member squad will be determined after discussions with the selection panel. Meanwhile, Cricket Operations In-charge Shahriar Nafees has stated that Shakib's inclusion will depend on both his availability and his selection for the series.\n\nAll-rounder withdraws from BD 'A' team's tour of Pak\n\nSaifuddin, who was selected for the second four-day match of a two-match series and the subsequent three-match one-day series against Pakistan 'A', communicated his need for a break via email\n\nAll-rounder Mohammad Saifuddin has withdrawn from the upcoming Bangladesh 'A' team's tour of Pakistan, citing mental exhaustion and requesting a two-month break from all cricketing activities.\n\nSaifuddin, who was selected for the second four-day match of a two-match series and the subsequent three-match one-day series against Pakistan 'A', communicated his need for a break via email to the selectors earlier this month, according to a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official.\n\nIn his email, Saifuddin expressed his disappointment over not being selected for the ICC T20 World Cup squad in June and his inability to travel to Canada for the ongoing Global T20 due to unrest in the country.\n\n\"Due to these matters, I want to keep myself away from all forms of cricket for the next two months. Hopefully, you will take the matter in a positive way,\" Saifuddin's email read.\n\nHowever, Saifuddin did not mention the right rib injury he sustained during a gym session in Mirpur two days before his scheduled flight to Canada in late July. He was set to represent the Montreal Tigers in the GT20, having obtained a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the BCB until August 8. Afterward, he was expected to join the 'A' team in Pakistan.\n\nBCB physio Muzadded Sany explained that Saifuddin noticed the injury after the gym session and consulted the BCB medical team when the pain persisted. BCB chief physician Dr. Debashish Chowdhury assessed his condition and provided treatment instructions, noting the severity of the pain. Concerns about the impact of a 22-hour economy-class flight on his injury led the BCB to advise against his travel to Canada.\n\nAccording to the report in The Daily Star, Saifuddin's recent letter has frustrated the selectors, as he had missed most of the Bangladesh Tigers' practice sessions in Sylhet and Chattogram last month.\n\nAn anonymous official noted that Saifuddin only participated in nine days of practice in Sylhet and four days in Chattogram out of a 45-day camp. He left the Chattogram camp early, citing the need to attend a biometric appointment for his Canada visa.\n\nPreviously, he had taken leave for family issues before Eid, and subsequently requested an extension, which was granted due to the family emergency. The official concluded by expressing concern over Saifuddin's current reluctance towards cricket.",

    "title": "Willow TV’s groundbreaking local broadcast partnerships – a highlight of MLC Season 2",
    "date": "Wed Aug  7 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Growing a professional sport in the US is a massive undertaking: a multi-decade, multi-front effort.\n\nAmong many other tactics, it requires exposing the sport to potential new fans, and having a product compelling enough to convert them into regular ones.\n\nSeason 2 of Cognizant Major League Cricket (MLC), held this past July, provided such a product. It featured dozens of the world’s top stars – a collection of franchise talent many say is second only to the IPL – and an exciting level of play.\n\nBut having a great tournament is actually the easier half of the battle.\n\nThe bigger challenge is getting a potential audience – existing cricket fans and, more importantly, non-cricket fans – to notice what is going on to begin with.\n\nJust getting to that starting point requires first winning an all-out war for consumer attention: against every other entrenched major professional sport and every form of passive video entertainment – from YouTube to social media platforms to streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon.\n\nWith the dust now settling on MLC Season 2, it is becoming clear that the awareness initiative with arguably the highest impact this time around, and with even stronger potential for future seasons, was Willow by Cricbuzz’s local broadcast partnership strategy, spearheaded by COO Todd Myers.\n\nSpecifically, Willow partnered with Regional Sports Networks (RSNs) for each of the MLC teams to broadcast select free MLC matches, even though Willow itself is a subscription-based broadcaster.\n\nWillow and the MLC\n\nWillow by Cricbuzz (“Willow TV” or “Willow”), owned by Times Internet, is a pillar of US cricket. It is the official North American broadcaster for the ICC, virtually all major franchise tournaments, and many national boards. So it has a keen interest in growing cricket in the US.\n\nMoreover, Willow was not only the official North American broadcaster of Major League Cricket’s Season 2, it was also a major sponsor – one of the two Official Partners.\n\nIt was through that lens that Willow’s COO Myers – who previously spent over 16 years as a producer programming director with ESPN – approached the challenge of expanding the MLC’s broadcast audience.\n\n“Look,” says Myers, “we want to grow cricket in the US. And one path to do that is to expose cricket to more mainstream sports fans that are watching other sports.”\n\nSo Myers conceived of an ambitious plan only a few months before the tournament to partner with RSNs, namely:\n\nMonumental Sports Network (DC Freedom)\n\nYES Network (MI New York)\n\nROOT SPORTS (Seattle Orcas)\n\nBally Sports Southwest (Texas Super Kings)\n\nBally Sports SoCal (LA Knight Riders)\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nNBC Sports California (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\n“These RSNs combined reach a way larger potential audience than Willow. And it’s that exposure piece for the league, for the individual teams and then for the sport of cricket to grow as well.”\n\nConverting local sports fans to cricket fans, one at a time\n\nBeyond the simple exposure math, Myers emphasized the importance of RSNs to introducing existing local sports fans to a new local sports team.\n\n“So we have a deal with Root Sports Northwest. You like Seattle sports? Great. We’ve got another professional team for you to root for, the Seattle Orcas. And oh, by the way, if you’re watching the Mariners game, you can watch the cricket. There’s no additional subscription fee that you have to pay, or subscribe to another tier on television. It’s all Root Sports Northwest. ”\n\nSeattle Orcas CEO Hemant Dua noted how the value was not just in broadcasting into new homes, but also bringing cricket into public spaces, especially sports bars, and introducing the sport beyond the traditional South Asian audience.\n\n“Sports pubs are visited by the local populations and the percentage of South Asians is probably 5% of the foot traffic footfalls, right? And if you look at what’s up on the screen it’s all the time? Root Sports. So even a few matches shown this year, at the pubs thousands will see cricket. That to me if, even out of that a small percentage convert, that’s a huge win.”\n\nThe Orcas took it a step further and planned local activations around games, complete with games and fan activities, at major sports bars such as Seattle’s Flat Stick pub:\n\nMulti-platform collaboration\n\nThe partnerships between teams and RSNs also extended beyond broadcast and into social media.\n\nFor example, the YES Network (owned by the New York Yankees) did extensive social posts with the MI New York team.\n\nThis worked as expected: networks like YES were thrilled to collaborate with players with social media profiles of the magnitude of Rashid Khan.\n\nAccording to Jared Boshnack, the YES Network VP of Production, “The entire MI New York organization and their partners were incredible to work with and we used assets to collaborate and execute promotions across all of our platforms.”\n\nThis was also an effective channel to introduce cricket to new American fans, as seen in priceless comments such as: “Can any of these guys play 2nd base?”\n\nThe YES Network also included cricket in its other programming, including a “Cricket 101” segment on Jimmy ‘Jomboy’ O’Brien’s popular studio show.\n\nPlaying away from home\n\nAnother important function played by these broadcast partnerships was helping solidify the connection between local fans and teams that were not playing in their hometowns.\n\nWith the exception of the Texas Super Kings, none of the MLC teams have a home stadium, and these other five teams played all their games on the road in Grand Prairie, TX or Morrisville, NC\n\nIn that context, these broadcasts are critical to bridging the gap between now and a future where MLC teams all play home games. David White, GM of the San Francisco Unicorns, explains:\n\n“To take Major League Cricket to its full potential, it’s critical that we have the broadcast partners to take what is a first class sporting product to the widest audiences. We want to give Unicorns fans the chance to watch their heroes while they’re on the road.\n\n“This partnership with NBC Sports is the ideal platform to showcase what the Unicorns are all about to a sports mad Bay Area, and will lay the foundations for future support as we look to build a local fan base capable of filling out our future stadium game in, game out.”\n\nA two-way street\n\nFor as much value as the MLC teams and the league are getting out of the RSN partnerships, the RSNs are getting tremendous benefits as well.\n\nFor starters, cricket brings with it a very attractive demographic. Just as teams are eager to reach local fans of same-city sports teams, Regional Sports Networks are keen to expand their network to new local audiences, especially the professional-heavy South Asian demographic, which is present in large numbers in all the MLC markets.\n\nCaitlin Mangum, Vice President, Content & Programming at Monumental Sports Network agreed with this: “Cricket is undergoing a surge of popularity in the U.S. and we’re excited for a new audience to get exposure to the plethora of live, local sports programming on our air.”\n\nThe other valuable asset that the RSNs are obtaining in these partnerships is the content itself. And this comes at an interesting and challenging time for RSNs, who are facing a major challenge from streaming and OTT models.\n\nThe Yes Network, owned by the Yankees, is an exception to these content challenges. But the remainder of the RSNs in question have to license sports content from teams, and are also losing subscribers, leading to well documented challenges to their business models.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the content provided by cricket is a very welcome, and attractive, asset.\n\nEducating RSNs\n\nAccording to Willow’s Myers, when he first reached out to the RSNs about the possibility, they were extremely positive:\n\n“Each of the RSNs was truly very enthusiastic about it. We didn’t have any negativity from the other side of like – oh that’s cricket, we don’t care. No one said viewers won’t care. It was the exact opposite: ‘This is cool. We love to try to be part of this and help grow MLC and grow cricket.’”\n\nAt the same time, they needed to be educated, especially on cricket as a broadcasting proposition.\n\nMyers continued: “I had to educate them, which is probably no surprise, on just what the sport of cricket is. Not that they didn’t know the sport existed, but: here’s how a game works, how to use vernacular, how a match plays out – ex. after every over there’s a 30 second commercial, explaining to them that when there’s a strategic time out or when a wicket falls that creates a commercial break. So kind of explaining them to the game. But all of them were very enthusiastic.”\n\nLessons for the future: an earlier start in 2025\n\nIf there was one glaring area for improvement in the future for this initiative, it is in the execution timeline.\n\nMyers reflects on lessons learned: “What would I change? I would engage with our RSN partners a lot earlier. Because literally we were completing deals right up until almost when the first ball was bowled. And that was because we reached out really late to try to make this happen. It takes time to get contracts done.”\n\nAs a result, the opportunity was not maximized. RSN schedules are programmed in advance, and not everything could fall neatly into place this time.\n\nLead time would also help with respect to planning marketing activations like the Orcas pursued.\n\nMyers continued: “Instead of engaging with these partners in mid-May, it should be early April. But the second time around should be easier. They will have (already) done it. We won’t have to go through the education process again, it should be more streamlined.”\n\nAll that said, the teams are already getting excited for 2025.\n\n“I think Todd’s done a great job on this,” said the Orcas’ Dua, summing up the sentiment in the league about Willow’s initiative. “So more power to him and we’re very excited and we want to build this and showcase all our games next year.”",
    "summary": "The second season of the MLC, held in July, featured top cricket stars and exciting gameplay, but the bigger challenge is getting a potential audience to notice the tournament.

The broadcasts helped bridge the gap between teams playing on the road and their local fans.\n\nThe RSNs also benefited from the partnership, gaining access to an attractive demographic and valuable content. However, the RSNs needed education on cricket as a broadcasting proposition, and the execution timeline was a lesson learned for improvement in the future. The teams are already looking forward to building on this initiative in 2025.",

The selectors have had trouble contacting Shakib in the last week because of the unrest, and they plan to talk to captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in the next few days before picking the final team.\n\nThe report also mentioned that an 18-player preliminary team has been made, including Shakib and fast bowler Taskin Ahmed, but the final 15-player team will be chosen after talking with the selection panel.

He played 13 Tests, 89 ODI’s, and 22 T20I’s for the England national side.\n\nPlunkett was crucial in his side’s win against New Zealand in the final, where he took three wickets including the big fish, Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson. Unfortunately for him, he never really settled into the squad after that as England started looking at options beyond him.\n\nAs a result, he has now decided to take up the sport in the USA, where cricket is slowly developing.

However, things are slowly beginning to change as the sport is developing amongst the Americans. When asked about the standard of the game right now in America, Plunkett stated:\n\n“I think there’s a lot of talent I’m sure. By watching you can see there’s some very good professionals, some good overseas players. Hopefully down the line, you see that switch where the youngsters in the USA are the ones that dominate the game but that’s gonna take time.”\n\n“The youngsters need to play against international cricketers and get used to that level. Then, they can prove themselves against them and then realize ‘I can actually play as good as these guys and then [start] believing in themselves.”\n\nSince debuting in 2005, Liam Plunkett took 41 wickets in 13 Tests, 135 wickets in 89 ODI’s, and 25 wickets in 22 T20I games.\n\nAlso Read– 5 Bowlers With Most Test Wickets On Home Soil",

    "date": "",
    "body": "Major League Cricket: Australia captain Pat Cummins has announced eight weeks complete off from bowling as he prepares his body for another action-packed cricket season, starting with the five-match home Test series against India in November.\n\nThe pacer was not picked for Australia's white-ball tour of the United Kingdom in September as part of workload management which gives him ample time to recover his body from tiring 18 months of cricket.\n\nThe 31-year-old recently returned from the United States following his maiden Major League Cricket campaign with San Francisco United.\n\nTrending\n\nThe last 18 months have been gruelling for Cummins. Following a wrist fracture towards the end of the Ashes series in England, he has played in an ODI series against India, the victorious ODI World Cup in India, three Tests against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour of New Zealand, two Tests against the Black Caps, the Indian Premier League, the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, and the MLC tournament.\n\n“I’m very sore today after a week of gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can’t really nail it while you’re in the midst of the season,” Fox Cricket quoted Cummins as saying.\n\nThe speedster said he will work on rehabilitation exercises during the break and focus on building strength ahead of the tight cricketing season.\n\n“I’ll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can’t really fit in the middle of the season,\" he added.\n\nCummins said the break will allow him to come back fresh and to avoid any injury setback.\n\n“Everyone that comes back after a break and is a little bit fresher, you never regret it. I’ve basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago,\" he said.\n\n“This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer. It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintain pace is a bit easier, make you less susceptible to injuries,\" Cummins added.\n\nThe Border-Gavaskar Trophy, now a five-Test series this summer, has been held by India since 2017. During this period, India has won four consecutive series, including landmark victories on Australian soil in 2018/19 and 2020/21. When Australia last won the trophy, Cummins had just one Test cap.\n\nDespite the Australian men’s team’s significant accomplishments in recent years - including two World Cup titles and a World Test Championship - Cummins recognised that India’s dominance in Test cricket remains “the one blight” that needs to be addressed.\n\n“It’s the trophy I haven’t won before … this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven’t ticked off,” Cummins said.\n\n“We’ve achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\n“That’s what lies ahead of us this summer. They’re a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we’re really well placed also,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Cummins revealed that he has no plans to retire from the game’s shortest format, hoping he can help Australia win gold at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. “Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle,” Cummins said.\n\n“That’s what lies ahead of us this summer. They’re a really good side.

His confirmation for the IPL 2025 auction has sparked interest among several IPL teams, each with their own strategic reasons for wanting him on board. Here are three teams that might be at the forefront of the bidding war for Smith:\n\n1. Rajasthan Royals (RR):\n\nContext: Smith has a history with RR, where he was once the captain. His leadership qualities and his ability to anchor innings could be invaluable, especially if RR looks to bolster their middle order or even consider him for a leadership role if there’s a change in dynamics.\n\nWhy Smith?:\n\nHis previous association might make him a familiar choice, easing his integration into the team.\n\nRR might see him as a stabilizing force, providing both runs and leadership, which could be crucial intheir pursuit of the elusive IPL title.\n\n2.

While some of his teammates, including Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, have expressed a preference for him to bat at number four, Smith said he remains flexible.\n\n“Those conversations are happening in the background.

This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer.\n\n“It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, makes you less susceptible to injuries,” he added.\n\nCummins had a busy last 12 months after fracturing his wrist towards the end of the Ashes campaign in England.\n\nHe played in an ODI series against India, the triumphant ODI World Cup campaign, three Tests against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour of New Zealand, two Tests against New Zealand, the Indian Premier League, the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the MLC tournament.\n\n“I’m very sore today after a week of gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can’t really nail it while you’re in the midst of the season,” the 31-year-old said.\n\n“I’ll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can’t really fit in the middle of the season.”\n\nThis year’s Border-Gavaskar Trophy will be a five-Test contest. Since 2017, Australia has failed to lay its hands on the trophy, with India winning four consecutive series including the historic triumphs on Australian soil in 2018-19 and 2020-21.\n\nAnd, Cummins is desperate to lift the trophy this summer under his captaincy.\n\n“It’s the trophy I haven’t won before&mldr; this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven’t ticked off,” Cummins said.\n\n“We’ve achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\n“That’s what lies ahead of us this summer. They’re (India) a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we’re really well placed also,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Cummins is in no mood to quit T20 cricket as of now, and hopes to help Australia win the gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make its debut at the quadrennial showpiece.\n\n“Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle,” Cummins said.\n\n“I’d love to be on that side (at LA28). I think I’ll be 35 or something, so hopefully still there or thereabouts.\n\n“Honestly right now, it feels a long way away. Maybe once we get closer and start building into it, everyone gets a bit more excited,” he said.\n\nWith PTI inputs",

    "title": "A Moment Of Reflection for USA Cricket",
    "date": "Tue Aug 13 15:00:00 2024",
    "body": "“It was a lot of fun.”\n\nThis was a common refrain heard from many international superstars who had descended on American soil to play at the second edition of the U.S. Major League Cricket. Pat Cummins looked as relaxed as he’s ever been, squeezing in rounds of golf between games. Steve Smith, captain of the Washington Freedom was beaming when they capped off a near undisputed season with a decidedly one sided win in the finals defeating San Francisco Unicorns (almost as good a name as the Seattle Orcas) by over a 100 runs. This critic actually fell asleep on the job (Sshhh don’t tell the editors). Was some nail biting too much to ask, Steve? Now I have to use a nail cutter like regular people.\n\nBut that final is ancient history in cricket time. The players have moved on to other assignments with their home countries or at The Hundred (yawns in Brit) and Global T20 in Canada. Sri Lanka defeated India in a bilateral ODI series for the first time in 27 years, dominating by spin. The West Indies test team is still breaking our hearts (the word is limerence, google it). And then you had this minor sporting event called the Olympics but let’s not waste any time on that.\n\nRicky Ponting, the head coach of the Freedom and a forward thinking maverick, sees the United States as a playground for cricket’s future. He urged USA Cricket to push the game at the grassroots level especially for kids.\n\nLocal administrators have already got that ball rolling with multiple initiatives like a minor league that has brought small clubs and teams from across the country under its umbrella. The country has been divided into four zones to allow for easier selection and scouting, given that most US states might not have a strong cricket presence unlike more established cricket playing nations. According to USA Cricket, there are over 400 local leagues with around 200,000 players active around the country.\n\nPlans are afoot to have a rookie league for newer entrants into the sport and age group tournaments with academies to nurture young talent, along with training for umpires and coaches. While still nascent, USA women’s cricket is slowly finding a foothold in the international game.\n\nWhen Ponting spoke about grassroots though, he wasn’t just referring to the usual round of expats and first/second generation immigrants from cricketing countries like South Asia and the Caribbean, but children from all ethnic and cultural groups that call the U.S. their home.\n\nI admire Ponting’s trademark Aussie bullishness but Americans still view cricket as this archaic pastime that they can use as fodder for bad jokes. If only they saw how baseball is a poor substitute, they might change their perspective.\n\nNow that I’ve drummed up controversy, let’s get realistic for a second. Cricket is still very much an expat sport in the U.S.; they hosted an entire World Cup and it barely scratched the veneer of American primetime television.\n\nMillions of Americans watched bemused at Indian techies frothing at the mouth supported men in blue. Grounds and accessibility were woeful especially in New York, and for those who could make it to the venue, ticket prices, upwards of $300 were out of reach. Major League Cricket addresses some of those failings in cost and access. They might spread the gospel of cricket in America but seem to operate in a comfy bubble of expat eyeballs.\n\nFor a beloved sport to be taken seriously in the U.S., this not-so-humble armchair critic feels that there has to be some bombastic cross promotions with other sporting megabeasts like the NBA or the NFL. Good luck getting those behemoths to share airspace but in my dream scenario, I see Steph Curry bowling or Lebron hitting a six out of the ground. If we can get superstars to play cricket and experience its joys, then audiences might start paying attention beyond a distracted guffaw at hearing that a cricket match can go on for five days.\n\nUSA Cricket has an arduous journey ahead, especially after being pulled up by the ICC for “non compliance” with the requirements of the Associate status. Administrators have to produce visionary moves to elevate cricket as a serious sport in the USA. Else, it will just be a bit of fun for international cricketers looking for that U.S. vacay.",
    "summary": "The second edition of the U.S. Major League Cricket has concluded, with the Washington Freedom winning the tournament comfortably. International stars, including Pat Cummins and Steve Smith, participated in the tournament and had a great time. Despite the success of the tournament, the article notes that cricket still has a long way to go to gain traction in the US. Ricky Ponting, the head coach of the Freedom, emphasized the importance of developing cricket at the grassroots level, particularly among local kids. Efforts are underway to develop the sport, including the creation of a minor league and plans for a rookie league and age group tournaments. However, the article suggests that cricket is still largely an expat sport in the US and that more needs to be done to promote it to a wider American audience. The author suggests that cross-promotions with other popular sports like the NBA or NFL could help increase cricket's visibility in the US.",

The best example of this is Shai Hope, who at one point was touted to take the West Indies forward in Test cricket. One bad series and it just all fell apart and he is nowhere near the Test setup now and has strengthened his position in T20 cricket, even made his IPL debut earlier this year.\n\nThe number of franchise leagues, which have germinated across the world have not only brought up opportunities for the players to play on the big stage but has kept them busy enough and given them money enough to stay on that path only.\n\n\"I'm always excited watching the other West Indian batters, especially when they're hitting boundary after boundary,\" Russell said. \"As long as you can do well from contracts outside your nation I think they are going to grab that opportunity but everyone wants to play on the big stage.\n\n\"So, if the big stage comes in Test cricket, I know youngsters will be happy to play.

Known for his flawless technique and exceptional leadership, Smith has enjoyed a decorated career on the international stage.\n\nAlthough he last played in the IPL in 2021, Smith’s recent success in Major League Cricket (MLC) suggests he’s far from done.\n\nLeading Washington Freedom to their first-ever MLC title in 2024, Smith not only captained the side but also emerged as the leading run-scorer, accumulating 336 runs at a strike rate of 148.67.\n\nHis match-winning 88 in the final showcased his ability to deliver under pressure, making him an attractive option for IPL teams.\n\nHere are three teams that could benefit from bringing Steve Smith on board:\n\nRajasthan Royals\n\nSteve Smith previously captained RR [X.com]\n\nRajasthan Royals, a team Smith previously captained, might consider rekindling their association with the Australian star. While Sanju Samson leads the side, adding a seasoned leader like Smith to the leadership group could bolster the team’s chances of clinching their second title.\n\nMoreover, Smith’s ability to anchor the innings in the middle order would provide much-needed stability to the Royals, who have often struggled with consistency in that department.\n\nLucknow Super Giants\n\nLucknow Super Giants might bring in Steve Smith [X.com]\n\nLucknow Super Giants (LSG) could be another potential destination for Smith. LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka has a history with Smith, having made him captain of the Rising Pune Supergiants in 2017, a move that nearly resulted in an IPL title.\n\nWith KL Rahul possibly leaving the team, Smith’s leadership experience and tactical acumen could be invaluable. His presence at the top of the order would also add firepower to LSG’s batting lineup.\n\nDelhi Capitals\n\nDelhi Capitals might bring in Steve Smith [X.com]\n\nDespite Smith’s previous stint with Delhi Capitals, the franchise could benefit from his return. Rishabh Pant’s leadership has seen mixed results, and the team has often lacked a steady presence in the middle order.\n\nSmith’s calm demeanor and vast captaincy experience could help stabilize the team’s performance. His ability to adapt and perform under pressure could be the key to turning around Delhi’s fortunes in the IPL.",

An ODI series against Pakistan in early November may also be on the cards for him to build up match fitness ahead of the crucial Tests against India and Sri Lanka. \"Coach Andrew McDonald and I have discussed this extensively,\" Cummins told News Corp, as reported by ESPNCricinfo. \"I plan to play either two or three ODIs, along with some Sheffield Shield games or New South Wales one-day matches around late October and early November.\" NSW's Shield fixtures against Victoria start on October 20, and they face Queensland from November 1, overlapping with the ODI series against Pakistan.

This decision comes after Cummins recently completed a stint in Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States and has been rested from Australia’s upcoming white-ball tours of Scotland and England.\n\nCummins, who last played in the Sheffield Shield for New South Wales in February 2021, has had limited appearances in four-day domestic cricket throughout his career, with only nine matches under his belt. However, with the demanding home summer approaching — featuring five Tests against India followed by two more in Sri Lanka — Cummins is looking to balance his build-up to these matches while ensuring he remains fresh and injury-free.\n\nFocus on Strength and Conditioning\n\nSpeaking to News Corp, Cummins explained his approach to the coming months, emphasizing the importance of both physical preparation and match readiness. “Ronnie [coach Andrew McDonald] called me the other day and said we need to talk about this,” Cummins said. “I prefer to go a little bit fresher but definitely play some cricket going in.”\n\nCummins outlined his potential schedule leading up to the India series, which may include participating in two or three ODIs against Pakistan in early November, as well as playing a Sheffield Shield match or engaging in some limited-overs cricket for New South Wales. “I imagine kind of late October/early November will be when I start playing, building up for the Tests,” he added.\n\nCritical Test Series Against India\n\nThe upcoming Test series against India is crucial for Australia as it will play a significant role in determining their chances of defending their World Test Championship title at Lord’s in June 2025. Australia currently sits second in the WTC standings, trailing India. With a packed schedule ahead, Cummins and the Australian team management are keen to ensure that the fast bowler is in peak condition to lead the side through a demanding series.\n\nStarc, Hazlewood, and Lyon Also Eye Domestic Cricket\n\nCummins isn’t the only Australian star eyeing domestic cricket as part of their preparation. Mitchell Starc, who is set to play in the ODI series against England after resting from the T20Is, and Josh Hazlewood, who will participate in the entire tour, could also feature for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield ahead of the international season. Additionally, Nathan Lyon is expected to play at least two Shield matches before facing India.\n\nMost of Australia’s top-order batters are likely to be available for the Sheffield Shield in October, providing them with valuable match practice before the Test series. Those not selected for the ODI series against Pakistan could have another outing in the Shield, while two Australia A four-day matches against India A in Mackay and Melbourne will offer further opportunities for fringe players to stake their claims.\n\nPlanning for a Grueling Season\n\nCummins’ return to the Sheffield Shield marks a strategic move to ensure he is both physically and mentally prepared for the rigors of the upcoming Test season. Missing the England tour was a long-planned decision, with Cummins focusing on building strength and conditioning over the next six to eight weeks. “I’ll have a good six or eight weeks off bowling where I’ll get in the gym every day, do some running, and get some strength back into my body,” Cummins said.\n\nWith the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan next February and a busy Test calendar, Australia’s management is carefully planning the workload of their premier fast bowlers to ensure they remain fit and firing for the crucial months ahead. Cummins’ return to domestic cricket will be closely watched as Australia prepares for one of the most anticipated Test series of the year.",

This has led to a discussion on how to strike an adequate balance of rest and preparation in such a way that will make sure Cummins is in his best shape for the test facing him. “Ronnie [Andrew McDonald] gave me a call the other day and said we need to chat about this. I like going actually a little bit fresher, but certainly cricket going into it,” Pat Cummins told News Corp.\n\nThe fast bowler also provided hints regarding his intended schedule ahead of the Test series.

Even if they retain him, Faf is most likely to be replaced as a skipper.\n\nThe Challengers have never won the IPL, and Smith can be the breakthrough man for them as he is not only a suitable skipper but also an ideal batsman to enter the RCB lineup as he can add semblance to their middle order.\n\nALSO READ: WI vs SA: Mulder Outshines Shamar Joseph’s heroics at Guyana in the 17-wicket opening day\n\nChennai Super Kings\n\nThis franchise would seem unlikely to look for a skipper, but since MS Dhoni has decided not to be CSK’s captain even if he features for them, then the franchise is looking for an ideal man in the role.\n\nSteven Smith has always been one of the finest captains, as even the great MS Dhoni has played under him in the Rising Pune Supergiants camp. Smith can be roped into the side, especially with CSK always having an urge for the senior players.\n\nGujarat Titans",
    "summary": "* Steven Smith recently led the Washington Freedom side to a victory in the second season of the MLC in 2024, marking his comeback into franchise-level T20 cricket.\n* This was a significant performance for Smith, coming after his impressive innings in the Big Bash League (BBL) last season.\n\nNote that the rest of the article focuses on Smith's potential return to the Indian Premier League (IPL) and does not provide further information about the MLC tournament.",

    "body": "Pat Cummins, the captain of Australia’s Test cricket team, is planning a short return to the Sheffield Shield to prepare for the upcoming Test series against India, which is set to commence in late November. Cummins, who has just finished a stint in Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States, has been given a break from Australia’s white-ball tour of Scotland and England scheduled for next month. This time off will allow him to concentrate on his strength and conditioning, ensuring he is in peak form for the home summer season. The Sheffield Shield matches will serve as a critical part of Cummins' preparation, offering him an opportunity to fine-tune his skills and regain match fitness before facing India. The Test series against the Indian team will be a demanding one, consisting of five matches spread over slightly more than seven weeks. Following this intense series, Cummins and the Australian team will then travel to Sri Lanka for two additional Test matches, making for a busy and challenging schedule.\n\nOverall, Cummins' strategy reflects a thoughtful approach to balancing rest and preparation. By focusing on conditioning and competitive play in the Sheffield Shield, he aims to be fully prepared for the rigors of the Test series against India and the subsequent tour of Sri Lanka. His proactive approach underscores the importance of meticulous planning and physical readiness in maintaining peak performance throughout a busy international cricket calendar.\n\nThe upcoming seven Test matches against India and Sri Lanka are crucial for Australia as they determine the team’s chances of defending their World Test Championship title at Lord’s next June. Currently, Australia is positioned second in the World Test Championship standings, trailing behind India. These matches will be pivotal in Australia’s quest to secure a spot in the final and retain their championship status.\n\nPat Cummins, who last participated in the Sheffield Shield for New South Wales in February 2021, has played in only nine Shield matches throughout his career. His brief return to the domestic competition will be a vital part of his preparation for the upcoming Tests. Cummins' involvement in the Shield will help him regain match fitness and sharpen his skills ahead of the high-stakes series against India.\n\nIn addition to the Sheffield Shield, there is an ODI series against Pakistan scheduled for early November. This series could also play a role in Cummins' preparation, providing him with valuable match practice and helping him build form and rhythm before the Test series begins. Overall, Cummins’ strategic focus on domestic cricket and potential ODI involvement reflects his commitment to ensuring peak performance in the critical Test series. The outcomes of these seven Tests will be significant, as they will determine Australia’s ability to defend their World Test Championship title and influence their preparations for the final at Lord’s.\n\n\"Ronnie [coach Andrew McDonald] called me the other day and said we need to talk about this.I prefer to go a little bit fresher but definitely play some cricket going in. So I'd say it's either two or three ODIs, plus a Shield [game] or maybe just some Shield, maybe some NSW one-day stuff. I imagine kind of late October/early November will be when I start playing building up for the Tests,\" said Australian captain Pat Cummins during a recent interview.",

Greg Abbott said in a news release. “As cricket expands its global fanbase, Texas will hold front-row seats to its growth across the nation.”",

As Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 approaches, the anticipation is building for an action-packed season featuring some of the best cricketing talents from around the world. Among these players, all-rounders are crucial as they provide balance and versatility to their teams. Here, we spotlight five all-rounders you can’t miss in MLC 2024.\n\nSunil Narine\n\nSunil Narine has been exceptional, particularly in the 2024 IPL where he was the highest-impact player of the tournament. With 488 runs at a strike rate of 180.7 and 17 wickets at an economy rate of 6.7, he was second-best only to Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nNarine’s versatility is invaluable, especially on the slightly sluggish pitches expected in America. He might be utilized as an opening batter, a role where he has found significant success for the Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nRead More: Which Top 5 Batters Will Dominate MLC 2024?\n\nAndre Russell\n\nAndre Russell, the dynamic West Indian all-rounder, was the standout performer for the Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) last season. Despite the team’s overall struggles, Russell’s batting brilliance shone through with a strike rate close to 160 and an excellent average of 68, including two fifties.\n\nIn 2024, Russell has continued his form, boasting a batting average of around 43 and a phenomenal strike rate of 203.2 in 28 innings. Fresh off a title-winning campaign with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, Russell’s explosive hitting and useful bowling will be key for LAKR’s success in MLC.\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nWith a reputation for explosive batting, Glenn Maxwell entered IPL 2024 on fire, having accumulated 552 runs in 17 T20s since November 2023, with an average of 42.46 and a strike rate of 185.85, including two hundred. However, his IPL 2024 performance was underwhelming, scoring only 52 runs in 10 matches at an average of 5.78.\n\nDespite this, Maxwell remains a key figure for Washington Freedom in MLC 2024. His ability to change the game with both bat and ball makes him a critical component of the team.\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nRachin Ravindra’s meteoric rise in international cricket has been nothing short of spectacular. After a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup, Ravindra was snapped up by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for INR 1.8 crore in the IPL. His explosive debut, where he opened the innings due to Devon Conway’s injury, saw him scoring a quickfire 37 off 15 balls against the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and a 20-ball 46 against the Gujarat Titans.\n\nNow, Ravindra is expected to open for Washington Freedom in MLC 2024. With pitch conditions in the USA likely to assist his bowling, Ravindra’s performances will not only be critical for his team.\n\nMitchell Santner\n\nMitchell Santner, one of the most promising all-rounders in the world, has been a potent force for New Zealand in limited-overs cricket. With his vast experience playing across different conditions globally, Santner brings a wealth of knowledge and skill to the Texas Super Kings (TSK).\n\nWith dual strengths in batting and bowling, Santner is an essential team member. He has accumulated 199 wickets in 196 matches while scoring 2213 runs, showcasing his capability to impact the game in multiple facets. On the batting-friendly pitches of Texas.",

    "body": "Former Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has raised serious concerns following the conclusion of the second edition of Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024), which was won by the Washington Freedom after beating the San Francisco Unicorns in the final at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nGavaskar was in the US as part of the broadcast team for the recent Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024), where he witnessed drastic changes. He has expressed his disappointment over the MLC’s overall quality, despite several international stars featured in the league.\n\nSunil Gavaskar criticizes Major League Cricket 2024 after witnessing a decline in standards and attendance\n\nThe former Indian captain highlighted a significant decline in the MLC’s standards compared to its inaugural season. He pointed out that the lackluster crowd turnout for the MLC 2024 was almost opposite to the enthusiastic attendance seen during the first edition of the tournament.\n\nEven Gavaskar has suggested a major overhaul to restore the tournament's prestige, including imposing restrictions on players' franchise T20 league involvement to maintain a higher level of competitive cricket and deliver world-class entertainment to the fans.\n\nSunil Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar: “For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual.”\n\nPlayers should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues: Sunil Gavaskar\n\nGavaskar suggested that players should be limited to participating in only three T20 leagues in the world to maintain the high standards and competitiveness of the franchise tournaments. He said that IPL is the world’s best league and nobody wants to leave it, so the players must be allowed to play in the other two leagues in the world.\n\nHe added, “While nobody wants the players’ source of income to be curbed, I feel it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in three leagues of their choice. The IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So, the player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice.”\n\nExplaining his point of view, Gavaskar pointed out that players often compete for one IPL franchise while representing a rival IPL team in other T20 leagues. This situation is understandable if the player's IPL team doesn't have a team in the other leagues, but it seems strange to see players wearing the jersey of a rival IPL team in these other leagues.\n\nGavaskar signed off by saying, “Players are playing for one franchise in the IPL and turning up for the rival IPL franchise in the other leagues. It is understandable if the franchise they compete for in the IPL doesn’t have a team in the other T20 leagues, but it is odd to see them wearing a jersey of a rival IPL franchise in other leagues.”",

    "title": "Home runs: The growing Australia-USA cricket crossover",
    "date": "Sat Aug  3 04:14:00 2024",
    "body": "At a former baseball stadium in Dallas earlier this week, Australia's greatest male bowler and batter of their generation went head-to-head for the second time in four days.\n\nWhat shaped as a pair of captivating duels between Pat Cummins and Steve Smith hardly rated a mention in their home country as the Smith-captained Washington Freedom trumped Cummins' San Fransisco Unicorns in the Major League Cricket (MLC) finals.\n\nDespite Smith's match-winning hand of 88 off 52 balls in the tournament decider at the same Grand Prairie ground that hosted the T20 World Cup opener in June, Cummins maintained a little-known hold over his Test vice-captain in both the decider and a preceding qualifying final.\n\nIn the four T20 matches in which Smith has faced up to his long-time teammate, Cummins has dismissed him each time. Their head-to-head record stands at 4 wickets for 8 runs from 13 balls across their four encounters in the IPL, and now the MLC.\n\nIt's a fact few fans down under will be aware of (nor seemingly was San Fransisco skipper Corey Anderson, who failed to bowl Cummins through the middle overs of the final's first innings while Smith ran rampant) because none of their previous T20 encounters have been in Australia. Nor have they played together in a domestic T20 down under.\n\nSo how has a two-year-old tournament held in a non-Test playing nation been able to achieve something Australia’s own T20 league has not?\n\n\"It's new – being in America is obviously different to being in Australia, and having that experience is something players are really keen on having over here,\" Michael Klinger, the former first-class batter who is now the Washington Freedom general manager, told cricket.com.au.\n\n\"The other thing, which is pretty obvious, is it's a short tournament. It's a three-week tournament and players of that ilk, they're not coming for the money. They're coming for the experience. They don't need the money.\n\n\"This year was unique as well because the tournament was on the back of a World Cup which was played in America and the Caribbean, so lot of these players were already quite close to where we were playing.\"\n\nThe value of Australia’s star power aside, what this latest MLC campaign also revealed was how an increasing number of Australians are driving the fortunes of MLC.\n\nIt was a source of pride for Cricket NSW (CNSW) and Cricket Victoria (CV) that this year's finalists – the only two (of six) MLC teams not affiliated with IPL ownership groups – are basically extensions of their own high-performance programs.\n\nWashington Freedom are aligned with CNSW, where Klinger was until recently its head of male T20 cricket, while San Fransisco Unicorns have a similar partnership with CV, whose current general manager of cricket, Graham Manou, also attended the tournament.\n\nThe Washington and San Fransisco franchises are owned by Indian and Indian-American tech entrepreneurs, but CNSW and CV receive funding from the clubs in exchange for providing high-performance expertise and personnel.\n\nBoth teams' off-field staff are almost entirely made up of Australians. Ex-Test stars Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson are the team’s respective head coaches, complemented by Aussie support staff in Cameron White, Shawn Bradstreet (Washington), Ben Rohrer and Adam Griffith (San Fransisco). MLC's tournament director is Canberra-born Justin Geale, while San Fransisco's GM David White, CV's former head of community cricket, works with Manou in running the Unicorns.\n\nOf the 22 players who featured in the final on Monday morning (AEST), eight were Australian. A further eight took part in the competition. Travis Head was the tournament's most valuable player, while Smith was player of the match in the final.\n\nOn the flipside, many of San Fransisco and Washington's local American players had travelled to Australia during last summer's Big Bash.\n\n\"We made sure that they were exposed to the professionalism of high-level cricket, which not all of them had been exposed to, and play some games against high-quality opposition,\" said Klinger.\n\n\"To have them exposed to that no doubt has given us an advantage. Just from observing this tournament, it looks like at Washington Freedom and even San Francisco Unicorns, the local players have been the best in the competition.\"\n\nIn essence, the state associations are selling the success of Australian cricket.\n\nThat has not gone unnoticed; it is believed Cricket Australia is considering how it might have its own involvement in MLC, and there is an overriding desire to find tangible benefits for Australian cricket from the game’s growth in the USA, particularly ahead of cricket’s return to the Olympics at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\nMore immediately, that may come as soon as next month's KFC BBL overseas player draft, according to Klinger.\n\nA host of American players, including some who helped USA pull off their shock win over Pakistan that fired them into the T20 World Cup's Super Eights stage in June, will be up for grabs.\n\nAnderson, the former New Zealand international, featured for Hobart Hurricanes last season, but the likes of South Africa-born Andries Gous and former India U19 paceman Saurabh Netravalkar featuring in this summer's BBL would mark a step forward in the Australia-USA cricket relationship.\n\n\"I reckon there's going to be a few getting picked up,\" Klinger said. \"There's two in our team who I think (are good chances). Andries Gous a wicketkeeper-batsman who obviously did really well in the World Cup.\n\n\"Netravalkar – he was the leading wicket-taker over here and did well in the World Cup as well, a left-arm bowler who can bowl with the new ball and bowl variations at the death. I thought Hassan Khan from the Unicorns, a left-arm orthodox bowler and left-hand middle-order batter, could provide a team with a great option as well.\n\n\"Teams would be crazy not to have a look at them, especially with the lack of high-end talent coming into the draft this year from overseas. I think having those guys at the middle to the lower levels will add a lot to some teams.\"\n\nDriving the growth of US cricket has been the country’s large population who have south-Asian heritage.\n\nThe sell-out MLC final in Dallas underlined that community’s strong interest in the game, as did the enormous demand for tickets for the ICC's showpiece World Cup moment, the India-Pakistan match at a 'pop-up' stadium in New York.\n\nPonting believes more still more can be done by both the MLC and the ICC to develop the game among young Americans.\n\n\"I think there's a still a role for the players and the franchises. I think the World Cup missed a trick as well in not promoting the game more at grassroots level, getting into schools,\" Ponting, a broadcast commentator during the World Cup, said before the MLC final.\n\n\"That's where I think the next stage and growth will come from. This generation of American cricket fans, we can't just sit back and hope that they're going to promote the game.\n\n\"I think the game needs to do what it can to get out amongst kids. Baseball is such a big game for youngsters here in the US … (but) you go to a baseball game, it's four hours, there's not a lot of excitement that happens. I think it's less than one home-run hit per game.\n\n\"If you look at it that way, compared to what an entertainment package of three hours of cricket can bring to a younger generation, that's the way we should be looking at trying to promote the game here.\"\n\nThose involved in recruiting the game’s best cricketers to their nascent league, are realistic about the road ahead, with Klinger pointing out next year’s international schedule may not be as kind to the competition.\n\nThe scarcity of viable venues – this year’s MLC was played at just two, in Dallas and in Morrisville, North Carolina – is another concern. There is also no women’s MLC, though the BBC has reported discussions on an American women’s league are in their infancy.\n\nFor the world’s best men’s players, however, the MLC offers advantages its competitors cannot.\n\nCummins spoke openly about how the Unicorns owners’ links to Silicon Valley and the venture-capital industry was a major draw for him in signing a four-year deal with the team – an unprecedented move for a current Australian Test captain.\n\nCummins and Fraser-McGurk's filmed Zoom call with Travis Bazzana, a former junior cricketer from Sydney who last month became the first Australian to be taken with the number one pick in the Major League Baseball draft, was another 'only in America' moment.\n\nAustralian cricketers' social media posts of playing golf at some of the world's best courses, attending MLB games, eating southern barbeque, and even going to a Morgan Wallen concert, were shrewd advertisements of a trip to the USA.\n\nIn this respect, Klinger is bullish that the MLC is ahead of England's soon-to-be-privatised Hundred competition. \"Players are choosing it over the Hundred at the moment,\" he said.\n\n\"Who knows what happens in the future, that could change. In an ideal world I'd love to have those two tournaments separated. Potentially with the privatisation of the Hundred, there may be some duplicate owners in both leagues, if that's IPL setups or other setups.\n\n\"A short tournament where they can have maximum impact certainly helps (the MLC's appeal). It's going to be key for MLC down the track not to get too greedy and start to play too many games and make the tournament go longer.\n\n\"If they do that the likelihood is the best overseas players might not want to come. We've got to find that balance of keeping the tournament quite short and sharp and attracting the best players.\"",

For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe, because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual.\"\n\nGavaskar took the chance to put forward a solution to his perceived casual attitude of the star overseas players: \"This makes one feel that while nobody wants the players’ source of income to be curbed, it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in, say, three leagues.\n\n\"The whole world agrees that the IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So maybe a player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice.\"\n\nInterestingly, Gavaskar's comments come soon after a meeting between the BCCI and IPL team owners, at which the franchise owners sought to crack down on overseas players pulling out of the tournament despite being picked in the auction, reportedly suggesting a two-year ban if they pull out without a good reason (injury or international/family commitments).\n\nWhat are the existing restrictions in place?\n\nFranchise T20 leagues have been in the spotlight recently, as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) denied no-objection certificates to centrally-contracted players Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afridi to take part in the Global T20 league in Canada. Saim Ayub and Azam Khan have also not been given NOCs for the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nThe PCB has a formal policy written into players' central contracts, that they are allowed to play only in the Pakistan Super League, and two further franchise leagues in a given season.\n\nThe BCCI is another board that imposes restrictions on its players. India men's players are not allowed to participate in overseas franchise T20 leagues, unless they retire and forego the chance to participate in the IPL. However, India women's players have taken part in the Women's Big Bash League, the Women's Hundred and Women's Caribbean Premier League, to name a few.\n\nThe reason for this policy is believed to be that the presence of Indian players in the IPL makes it unique, and increases the value of the product overall. Most other cricket boards do not place such blanket restrictions on their players.\n\nThere have been increasing calls of late for a governing body such as the ICC, to introduce centralised regulations for franchise T20 leagues to ensure better coordination and manage players' workloads and movements better.",

    "date": "Fri Aug  2 12:10:00 2024",
    "body": "The overlap between the two competitions has caused significant disruption in the overseas player marker, with several marquee names not available for the start of The Hundred.\n\nMajor League Cricket: New kid on the block, but an attractive option\n\nAlthough the MLC is only in its second season, it has a huge volume of high profile international names on its roster. The most notable of these this season was Pat Cummins, who announced he would captain San Francisco Unicorns ahead of the tournament for its entirety, and on a multi-year basis until 2027. This was a significant coup for the youngest franchise league on the circuit to snap up the Australia captain, but also a blow for The Hundred that its biggest rival was able to attract the biggest names in the world.\n\nThe overseas names in MLC are second only to the IPL. To name just a few of the regulars on the franchise circuit who played in the tournament this year, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Trent Boult, Dwayne Bravo and Glenn Maxwell are some of the most well-known.\n\nHowever, where MLC has overtaken the Hundred is in its ability to attract either centrally contracted overseas players who are limited in the number of franchise tournaments they play. For example, South Africa players Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada and Heinrich Klaasen all picked up stints in the MLC. As did Australia's Alex Carey, Marcus Stoinis, Steve Smith and Travis Head.\n\nHaving multiple such high profile names in a squad means even below the elite level, the pool of overseas players is deep. For The Hundred, that does not exist this year. Several of the most high profile names dropped out before the tournament began. Shaheen Shah Afridi was set to play in the competition but withdrew at the beginning of the summer. The same happened with Naseem Shah as the PCB tighten their NOC regulations. With fewer international heavy weights and the overseas players beneath them short on star quality, there's no doubt the MLC overseas roster is far superior.\n\nWhy does The Hundred lag behind MLC?\n\nThere is a significant overlap of players who played in the MLC also playing in The Hundred once their obligations in the USA are fulfilled. Rashid Khan flew over after the conclusion of the MLC to reprise his place in Trent Rockets' squad. Adam Zampa did similar. But, in the gap before the highest profile names flew over, the tournament was notably less competitive.\n\nThere are several reasons why The Hundred has fallen so far off MLC in terms of overseas players. Firstly, the rules of MLC are specifically designed to bring in top quality talent from overseas, with cricket still a minority sport in the USA. Each franchise can have up to nine overseas players, with a maximum of six in an XI.\n\nFor The Hundred, only three overseas players are allowed in a squad. Not only is there simply more space for overseas players, but as more names join the competition, the quality of the cricket is guaranteed to be better with marquee players often making up more than half of each side.\n\nThe spectre of the IPL looms large\n\nThe IPL factor is also important. Four of the six MLC teams are owned by franchises with teams in the IPL. Players with contracts in one competition to a franchise with a presence in another have an easier way-in to a competition than those who don't. They can also go lengths to securing their place in another franchise competition they want to play in, like the IPL through playing for a franchise with a team in that league in a competition like MLC.\n\nIn many ways, particularly looking at the advances of competitions like the SA20 and MLC, franchise competitions who do not have some element of IPL team ownership are rapidly falling behind.\n\nRead more: Five uncapped players who England could pick for the Australia white-ball series\n\nThe timing of MLC this year also could not have been more perfect to attract the biggest names. With the T20 World Cup held in the Caribbean, it was a convenient hop over after the end of the tournament. There's also been a lack of international cricket outside of the England v West Indies Tests, meaning most players could afford to pick up a paycheque in a league before rejoining their national squads.\n\nWith the perfect conditions created this year for a tidal wave of overseas stars to add glitz to MLC, it's left The Hundred in a difficult position playing catch-up.",

Usually, they try to find a common batch of cricketers who represent them in all these leagues. Hence, if they have signed a player for one tournament, more often than not, this player will also be targeted for their squad in another league. On that note, here, we take a look at the list of two new Joburg Super Kings players whom CSK should target for IPL 2025.\n\n1) Jonny Bairstow\n\nJonny Bairstow was a big move by JSK for SA20 2025. With Reeze Hendricks not doing so well, the team had to work on the top order. They had retained Faf du Plessis and now, they have pulled off a coup by partnering Jonny Bairstow with him at the top of the order.\n\nJonny is an excellent T20 cricketer and would straightaway add value to the side. He has loads of experience and on his day, he could easily win a game for his side. Therefore, CSK should also target the cricketer and also because he can keep wickets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Tabraiz Shamsi\n\nTabraiz Shamsi is one of the new Joburg Super Kings players whom CSK should target for IPL 2025. It has been a while since CSK has had a good leg-spinner in the side. The last option they had was Imran Tahir and it was quite a few years ago. For the pitch at Chepauk, a good leg-spin option is a must.\n\nJSK executed a brilliant trade by bringing Shamsi to the franchise. Along with Imran Tahir, he would form a brilliant partnership in the spin department. Shamsi can surely weave his magic at a venue like Chepauk. He offers variety, as well. The South African cricketer is a passionate man and would be a top choice for CSK, too.",
    "summary": "The article mentions the Texas Super Kings, a team in the Major League Cricket (MLC) tournament, which is owned by the same owners as Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Joburg Super Kings in the SA20 League.

The article does not provide any further information about the MLC tournament, such as its schedule, format, or recent developments.

In desperate need of a strong start, the Unicorns faltered early. Jake Fraser-McGurk (3) was dismissed in the third over, and Marco Jansen delivered a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen (13), who had scored a century in the qualifier. At 30/3, the Unicorns were in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued with Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) falling early, dashing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then finished the job with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the match, Washington Freedom had lost Travis Head (9) early. Steve Smith (88) then took center stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock. He found support from Andries Gous (21), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without making significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, easily finding the boundary.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40) joined Smith, and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith’s departure, followed shortly by Maxwell’s, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. Washington Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nWashington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) defeated San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs.",

    "date": "Fri Aug  2 10:52:00 2024",
    "body": "It was a wonderful campaign for Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket as we won our maiden title in the 2024 season.\n\nWe were the first team to qualify for the Playoffs of MLC 2024 and also topped the points table after the league phase, with 11 points from seven games. It was a clinical performance as we won both our Qualifier and Championship matches to cap off a memorable season.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the major highlights for the Freedom squad this season.\n\nThe Aussie Flavour\n\nHead coach Ricky Ponting and assistant coach Cameron White took over the coaching duties at the start of the season. The signings of captain Steve Smith, Travis Head, and Glenn Maxwell, along with the coaching duo, brought the competitive edge that Australia possesses in international cricket.\n\nThe results were evident as the Aussies contributed significantly to our campaign, and we won seven out of nine matches in the entire season, with one match being abandoned due to rain.\n\nConsistent Performances\n\nFreedom showed consistency right from the get-go, making it to the Playoffs in both seasons. We finished third in the points table in MLC 2023 before losing to MI New York in the Eliminator.\n\nIn MLC 2024, we took a step forward by finishing at the top of the points table and won the Championship against the San Francisco Unicorns, demonstrating a marked improvement in our performance.\n\nPerfect start in the league stage\n\nWe had an excellent start to our MLC 2024 campaign, winning 5 of our first six matches in the league phase, with one match being abandoned due to rain. This helped us race off the blocks quickly, giving us the winning momentum and making us the first team to qualify for the Playoffs.\n\nThe convincing margins of our victories also ensured that we finished at the top of the points table with a better net run rate, although the San Francisco Unicorns also finished level on points with us. The top-two finish also gave us the chance to directly qualify for the Championship match by winning the Qualifier.\n\nSmith and Head: The Run Machines\n\nSteve Smith and Travis Head were in top form in MLC 2024, scoring more than half of our total runs this season. A majority of our large wins owed to the brilliant starts provided by the opening duo during the powerplay. Both batters had a breakthrough season this year finishing joint-second in the overall batting charts with 300-plus runs.\n\nSmith amassed 336 runs from nine matches at an excellent average of 56.00 and a strike rate of 148.67 whereas Head also tallied 336 runs from as many matches at an average of 48.00 and an astonishing strike rate of 173.19.\n\nTravis Head’s 5-consecutive fifties\n\nTravis Head had a dream debut season in Major League Cricket with the Freedom squad. Though the southpaw started slowly getting a meagre 33 runs from his first three matches, his next five matches produced a mammoth 294 runs, including five fifties, at a mind-boggling average of 73.50 and a strike rate of 176.05.\n\nIn the process, Head also created a breathtaking record in MLC, a run of five consecutive fifties, a feat which no batter has managed in the tournament. The last of those knocks saw him smash an unbeaten 77 off just 44 balls against the Unicorns in the Qualifier, Head’s highest score in the MLC.\n\nTravis Head, deservedly, finished as the Player of the Tournament in our victorious MLC 2024 campaign.\n\nBowling in partnership\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar finished as the highest wicket-taker in MLC 2024 with 15 wickets from only seven matches at an average of 13.46 and a strike rate of 10.53. But what impressed more was the performance of the supporting cast consisting of Rachin Ravindra, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell, all finishing with a tally of 10 or more wickets.\n\nRavindra’s left-arm spin accounted for 12 wickets from six innings at an unbelievable average of 6.08 and a strike rate of 7.58. The Kiwi took two four-wicket hauls and his 4/11 against the Unicorns in the Qualifier were the best bowling figures, both in his T20 career as well as in MLC 2024.\n\nMarco Jansen was impressive with the new ball providing crucial breakthroughs for us throughout the competition. He ended the MLC 2024 with 11 wickets from eight matches striking under every 17 balls he bowled.\n\nJansen’s three wickets in both the Qualifier as well as the Championship prevented the Unicorns’ big-hitting top order from breaking free and restricted them to modest totals.\n\nGlenn Maxwell and Lockie Ferguson also finished with 10 wickets each from eight and seven matches respectively to round off an excellent bowling performance for us this season.\n\nThough Jasdeep Singh and Andrew Tye played only two matches for us in MLC 2024, they shone in the limited opportunities they had by picking up six and five wickets, respectively.

    "body": "Washington Freedom won their maiden Major League Cricket Tournament beating San Francisco Unicorns in the Final of MLC 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Sunday.\n\nIt was a wonderful season as we finished on top of the MLC 2024 points table after the league phase and won both our Qualifier and Championship matches. We saw some all-round performances throughout the season as three of our bowlers and two batters finished in the top-five overall bowling and batting charts.\n\nHere is a look at some of our records in the MLC this season.\n\nHighest Total\n\nOur highest total in MLC 2024 came in the Chanpionship against the Unicorns when we scored 207/5 batting first. Incidentally, this is also the highest total in the entire competition this year. Having a huge first innings total helped us cross the line in the title match by 96 runs.\n\nOur 206/5, which we scored in a 42-run win over Texas Super Kings in a league game, is at second place in the overall list.\n\nHighest Individual Score\n\nSkipper Steve Smith’s 52-ball 88 in the Championship against the Unicorns, which powered us to the highest total this season, is the highest individual score for us in MLC 2024. Smith hit six sixes and seven boundaries during his innings to guide us to our first title in MLC.\n\nThis is also the highest individual score for us in the history of MLC as Smith went past Matthew Short’s score of 80 scored against TSK last season.\n\nTop Run-scorer\n\nSteve Smith and Travis Head, with 336 runs from nine matches, were the joint highest run-scorers for us in the MLC 2024 finishing second in the overall batting charts. Smith’s runs came at an impressive average of 56.00 and a strike rate of 148.67 whereas Head averaged 48.00 striking at an astonishing rate of 173.19.\n\nThe pair provided brisk starts at the top of the order and scored 52% of our total runs in MLC this season.\n\nLowest Total against Freedom\n\nMI New York’s 88 in response to our 182/5 is the lowest total by a team against us this season. Jasdeep Singh shone with the ball on his MLC debut picking up 3/14 to restrict MINY as we won the game by 94 runs.\n\nMarco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell also picked up two wickets apiece in an all-round bowling performance. This was also MINY’s lowest total in the MLC.\n\nHighest Wicket-taker\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar finished on top of the overall bowling charts in MLC 2024 with 15 wickets from just seven matches at an average of 13.46 and a strike rate of 10.53. The left-arm pacer’s best bowling effort of 4/35, this season, came against Los Angeles Knight Riders during our eight-wicket win.\n\nNetravalkar was also our top wicket-taker last season with 10 wickets from six matches.\n\nRachin Ravindra is second on the overall list with 12 wickets from six innings at an unbelievable average of 6.08 and a strike rate of 7.58.\n\nBest Bowling in an innings\n\nRavindra’s magical spell of 4/11 in the Qualifier match against the Unicorns is the best bowling figures recorded for us this year. The left-arm spinner’s career-best figures in T20s helped us qualify for the Championship with a seven-wicket win.\n\nIncidentally, Ravindra picked up another four-wicket haul this season, a spell of 4/16, in our league win against TSK by 42 runs.\n\nHighest Partnership\n\nSmith and Head’s 101-run association for the first wicket off just 60 balls in the final league match against the Unicorns is our highest partnership in MLC 2024. The duo hit nine fours and five sixes during their time together at the crease to provide us our first century partnership in MLC.\n\nBut unfortunately, we ended up on the losing side of the content as the Unicorns won by six wickets.\n\nLargest victory margin\n\nThe 96-run win over the Unicorns in the Championship of the MLC 2024 is our biggest victory margin by runs this year.\n\nBatting first, we posted 207/5 on the board with captain Steve Smith top-scoring with a 52-ball 88. In response, the Unicorns could manage only 111 as Ravindra and Jansen picked up three wickets each.\n\nThe eight-wicket win over LAKR during the league phase is our biggest victory in terms of wickets this season. Netravalkar and Maxwell got four and three wickets respectively as Travis Head shone with the bat with a 32-ball 54.\n\nHighest Batting average and strike rate\n\nSteve Smith, averaging 56.00, has the best average, second overall, for us in MLC this season. Out of the nine innings he has batted, Smith has scored 336 runs, including three fifties, and has remained unbeaten on three occasions. He reserved his best for the last as he top-scored in the Final with 88 off 52 balls to help us beat the Unicorns.\n\nMeanwhile, Travis Head has the best strike rate among our batters who have scored a minimum of 100 runs this season. Head amassed 336 runs this season at an excellent strike rate of 173.19. He is also fifth on the overall list of batters with the highest strike rate.\n\nThough Mukhtar Ahmed has a strike rate of 175.00, he faced only 24 balls for his tally of 42 runs in MLC 2024.\n\nMost Fifties\n\nTravis had a purple patch for us this season scoring five fifties, in five consecutive matches. Head leads the overall chart for most fifties in MLC 2024 with five from nine matches. Smith is second on our list with three fifties from the same number of matches.\n\nMost sixes and sixes in an innings\n\nWith 21 sixes from nine matches, Steve Smith is our highest six-hitter, and second overall, this season. Smith and Head, with six sixes each, together share the spoils for the most sixes hit in an innings.\n\nMeanwhile, Head leads the boundary count with a total of 40 fours from nine matches. The southpaw also holds the record for most fours scored in an innings for us with 10 fours in his unbeaten knock of 77 off just 44 balls against the Unicorns in the Qualifier match.\n\nBest Bowling average, economy and strike rate\n\nRachin Ravindra has the best bowling average in MLC 2024 with an average of 6.08 runs for every wicket picked up. The left-arm spinner ended with a total of 12 wickets from seven matches in this campaign conceding only 73 runs.\n\nRavindra also heads the charts for the best economy rates among bowlers in MLC this year. He has sent down a total of 15.1 overs in the tournament at a miserly economy rate of 4.81 runs an over.\n\nAmong bowlers who have sent down a minimum of 10 overs in MLC this year, Ravindra heads the list of best strike rates too with an impressive frequency of 7.58 balls per wicket. His total tally of 12 wickets came in just 91 balls.\n\nAndrew Tye and Jasdeep Singh with 6.00 and 7.00, respectively, have better strike rates but have bowled only five and seven overs each.\n\nMost Catches\n\nMukhtar Ahmed tops our list of most catches by an outfield player with seven catches from nine matches. He is also third on the overall list in MLC 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Mukhtar and Ferguson share the honours for most catches in a single match with three each against TSK and MINY, respectively.",
