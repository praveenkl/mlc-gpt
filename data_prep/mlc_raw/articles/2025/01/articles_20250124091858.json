        "body": "Separate windows will help both leagues to attract top overseas talent\n\nMatt Roller\n\n23-Jan-2025 • 16 hrs ago\n\nThe Hundred and Major League Cricket (MLC) will avoid a clash for 2025, boosting both leagues' chances of securing the world's best male players. Neither league has publicly confirmed dates for this season but ESPNcricinfo understands that MLC will run from mid-June to mid-July, finishing around two weeks before the Hundred starts in early August.\n\nThe two leagues overlapped by six days in 2024, undermining both competitions. The Hundred's overseas player pool included several late arrivals from MLC, prompting a series of last-minute replacement signings for one-off appearances, while Stephen Fleming left his role as Texas Super Kings coach early to take charge of Southern Brave.\n\nThe Hundred will still not have a clear window to itself this year, with a looming two-week clash with the Caribbean Premier League set to affect the availability of West Indies men's players. MLC's finals could also overlap with the long-delayed start of a European T20 Premier League, which is due to take place from July 15-August 3 in Ireland, the Netherlands and Scotland.\n\nFixtures for the Hundred will be released in full next week but the competition has been designated a clear window in August, avoiding a clash with any England matches - men's or women's. It is expected to start immediately after the fifth men's Test against India and run until the finals weekend on August 31.\n\nMLC recently appointed Johnny Grave as its new chief executive, after he stepped down from the same role at CWI in October. Grave has strong contacts within English cricket from his time at Surrey and the Professional Cricketers' Association, and will hope to improve MLC's relationship with the ECB in his new role.\n\nThe ECB has raised the top men's salary in the Hundred from £125,000 to £200,000 in a bid to attract leading men's players. The overseas pool was reasonably strong last year, but Pat Cummins caused the ECB some embarrassment when he admitted he had \"not thought\" of playing in the Hundred, instead signing a multi-year deal with San Francisco Unicorns in MLC.\n\nCummins, Steven Smith and Travis Head were among the Australia Test players involved in MLC last year though are not expected to be available for much of the 2025 edition due to a clash with a tour to the Caribbean. It raises the possibility that the trio could feature in the Hundred for the first time, if they choose to register for March's draft.\n\nHundred teams have already opened discussions with overseas players for the 2025 season, with each men's and women's team permitted one direct singing among their 10 retentions. The deadline for retentions is February 24, with the draft expected to take place in mid-March before the start of the IPL.\n\nESPNcricinfo understands London Spirit have agreed a deal to sign Kane Williamson as their captain, and are also interested in recruiting Jamie Smith from Birmingham Phoenix as their designated central contract player. Southern Brave and Manchester Originals are eyeing the signings of Laura Wolvaardt and Amelia Kerr respectively.\n\nThe CPL announced at the start of this month that it will run from August 14 to September 21 this year, effectively ruling male West Indian players out of the Hundred. The women's CPL, a significantly shorter competition which has only been played between three franchises to date, is likely to start in early September, meaning players should be able to feature in both.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",

        "body": "A potential clash between The Hundred in England and Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States of America (USA) seems to have been avoided.\n\nAccording to reports in ESPNCricinfo, after Johnny Grave, the former CEO of Cricket West Indies (CWI), was appointed as the new chief executive of the MLC, hopes have risen that an understanding will be created between the two mammoth T20 leagues to avoid a schedule clash. Grave has strong English connections through Surrey, which is part of the Professional Cricketers Association.\n\nNotably, The Hundred clashed for six days with the MLC in 2024, which affected the availability of top English and West Indian talents in the league. Even this year, the Hundred is set to clash with the Carribean Premier League (CPL) for about two weeks in August, which will limit the presence of top West Indies men cricketers.\n\nThe ECB also raised the player salaries of the top male players from £125,000 to £200,000 to keep the best players in its league and available for that duration. They would also hope that this raised price cap might appeal to the Australian players as well since Travis Head, Steven Smith, Marcus Stoinis, etc, are regular features in the MLC.\n\nThe Hundred is expected to begin after the last Test between England and India in the English summer this year and run through August.",

        "body": "Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Toronto, cities with significant South Asian communities, are on the shortlist\n\nTristan Lavalette\n\n20-Jan-2025\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC), the fledgling T20 tournament in the USA, is set to expand from six teams to eight by 2027, with a move into Canada being explored in developments that could have wider implications for the sport.\n\nChicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Toronto, cities with significant South Asian communities, are on the shortlist with final decisions expected this year. Market potential and local government support in helping build stadium infrastructure will be among the determining factors.\n\nExpansion officials travelled to Chicago recently and were believed to be encouraged by the local support. Visits to the other cities are expected in the coming months.\n\nMLC co-founder Satyan Gajwani will launch one of the franchises, while fellow co-founders Vijay Srinivasan, the league's chief executive until recently, and Sameer Mehta will helm the other. Investors are likely to partner up with them once the two cities have been selected.\n\nThree of the six teams in the MLC are owned by IPL team owners - Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings - while Seattle, the only small-market franchise in the league, have ties with Delhi Capitals. San Francisco and Washington don't have any IPL attachments, but have partnerships with Cricket Victoria and Cricket NSW respectively.\n\n\"There are many cities in America that have large populations of people who already love cricket. But the goal is to grow the game and that means expanding beyond that fan base.\"\n\nMLC co-founder Satyan Gajwani\n\n\"We have options ahead of us. I don't think we're committed one way or the other right now,\" Gajwani told ESPNcricinfo. \"That's realistically a decision we will take closer to launch.\"\n\nExpansion will likely lead to more games and a longer duration of the competition. MLC power brokers do eventually want a home-and-away season - where the teams play each other twice - to underpin the tournament.\n\nLast year's second season ran for 23 days in July and overlapped with the Hundred in the UK. This season's scheduling has not been announced, but a lengthier tournament is expected, although it might start earlier in June.\n\nThe well-heeled MLC's emergence has become a major talking point in English cricket, heightened when Jason Roy opted out of his ECB contract to represent LA Knight Riders, who have the same owners as KKR.\n\n\"There are many cities in America that have large populations of people who already love cricket. But the goal is to grow the game and that means expanding beyond that fan base,\" Gajwani said. \"America is the largest sports market in the world. It's also very competitive, and continuing to be relevant will be a challenge.\n\n\"But I think the economics of sport in America are pretty robust. The NBA and NFL are in 28 cities. We're in six right now. We still have a lot of headroom for growth in the medium to long term.\"\n\nThe tournament's first two seasons were entirely played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium, a redeveloped baseball ground, near Dallas and the more modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nExisting franchises - other than Dallas-based Texas Super Kings - have faced challenges getting suitable infrastructure off the ground. But there is confidence that San Francisco Unicorns will start playing home games this season at the iconic Oakland Coliseum, which up until recently was the long-time home of the Athletics in the MLB. The new franchises hope to play at home grounds from the start.\n\n\"In the ideal case, we firm up on the city, lock up a land deal and then build a stadium - whether retrofitted or building from zero,\" Gajwani said. \"The ideal outcome is that we play at home for our first game in 2027.\n\n\"There is this balance of wanting to build something that's right for where the market is, but have the flexibility to grow with the market. Every city will have its own dynamics.\"\n\nThe cities in the running may be further incentivised by the prospect of potentially hosting cricket matches at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Cricket will end a 128-year Olympic drought but venues have yet to be determined, with the men's and women's competitions possibly extending beyond Los Angeles.\n\n\"There's the added element that a fully-fledged cricket venue up and running by 2027 could possibly host matches at the Olympics,\" Gajwani said. \"The IOC or the LA Organising Committees will make that decision. But they openly said they're looking for infrastructure that can host Olympic matches. It's definitely a factor that we're all thinking about.\"\n\nThe league also announced Johnny Grave as its new CEO, replacing Srinivasan. Grave is a prominent figure in cricket administration, having most recently served as CEO at CWI for seven years. He was previously the commercial director at the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) in England.\n\n\"I am honored to lead the league at this transformative time,\" Grave said in a statement. \"Cricket is beloved globally and I am thrilled to see its fan base growing rapidly in the United States. I look forward to working with the MLC team to help elevate the league, engage with fans, and build a thriving, sustainable future for cricket in America.\"\n\nTristan Lavalette is a journalist based in Perth",
        "summary": "**Expansion Plans**: MLC is planning to expand from 6 teams to 8 by 2027, with Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Toronto shortlisted as potential new cities.
