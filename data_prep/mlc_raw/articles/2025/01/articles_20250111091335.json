        "date": "Sat Jan 11 07:25:00 2025",
        "body": "Smith, who was part of the Australia Test unit that recently won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at home, beating India 3-1, hit form in his first BBL game of the season. It was his first T20 since July, when he had turned up in the USA to play Major League Cricket.\n\nBBL: Steve Smith creates new record on comeback\n\nOpening with Josh Philippe, Smith hammered the fourth T20 century of his career, and his third in the BBL. He reached his century off just 58 balls, going on to remain unbeaten. All three BBL centuries have come in the last two years, which highlight his spectacular run in the format of late: in 21 innings since the start of 2023, he averages 59.37 with a strike rate of 158.86.\n\nThe 121* is now his second-highest score in T20s, having hit 125* in January 2023. All his BBL tons have come as opener.\n\nThe third BBL century now puts him atop the list of top century-makers in the tournament, joint with wicketkeeper-batter Ben McDermott. Only seven other batters have hit multiple centuries in the Big Bash League.\n\nSmith's century powered Sixers to 220-3, their highest score ever in BBL history. He was supported by a 23-ball 46 from captain Moises Henriques, as well as seven-ball blitz worth 23 runs from Ben Dwarshuis.\n\nMultiple centuries in BBL: Full list",
        "summary": "* Steve Smith played in the Major League Cricket tournament in the USA in July.\n* This was his last T20 appearance before playing in the current BBL game.\n\nNote: There is no additional information about the Major League Cricket tournament in the article beyond Steve Smith's participation in July. The majority of the article focuses on his performance in the Big Bash League (BBL)."
