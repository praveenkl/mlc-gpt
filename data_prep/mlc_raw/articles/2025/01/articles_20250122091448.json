Gajwani stated that while there are options, no firm decisions have been made yet, and the final choice will be made closer to the launch.\n\n\"We have options ahead of us. I don't think we're committed one way or the other right now,\" Gajwani told ESPNcricinfo. \"That's realistically a decision we will take closer to launch.\"\n\nChicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Toronto Shortlisted for MLC Expansion\n\nChicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Toronto, which have large South Asian communities, are being considered for the Major League Cricket expansion. The final decision on which cities will be included is expected later this year.\n\nKey factors for expansion include market potential and the support of local governments in developing stadium infrastructure. Recently, MLC officials visited Chicago and were reportedly impressed by the local backing.

It would be Canada’s first pro team outside of the Global T20 Canada tournament.\n\nThe MLC currently holds one tournament a year, with teams playing T20 cricket, a shortened version of the game that takes a few hours to play instead of several days.\n\nWhy it matters: Cricket is one of Canada’s fastest-growing sports, and 2024 was its biggest year yet. For the first time, the men’s national team participated in the prestigious ICC T20 World Cup (and even won a match), with ~75 million viewers watching Canadian matches globally.",
