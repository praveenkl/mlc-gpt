        "date": "Thu May 25 17:50:00 2023",
        "body": "In order to play in the forthcoming season of Major League Cricket in the United States, which will start on 13 July and last through 30 July, England's opening batter Jason Roy is anticipated to renounce his central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), according to a report published in The Daily Mail.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders team is expecting the World Cup-winning opener to sign a two-year deal with them. If he signs the deal with the team, the aggressive opener batter will risk losing his spot in the England team for the ODI World Cup 2023, which will be played in India.\n\nThe 32-year-old will be the first member of the England national cricket team to leave his central contract in order to focus on the T20 leagues around the world. He is currently on the list of players with central contracts with the ECB, and the board will have control over the player's schedule until October of this year.\n\nThe right-handed batter played a key role in England's 2019 home World Cup winning team. In eight games during the competition, he scored 443 runs with a remarkable average of 63.29 and a strike rate of 115.36. Given his terrible performance, he was excluded from the T20 World Cup in Australia in 2022.\n\nThe Daily Mail claims that Roy has been in discussions with ECB representatives about joining the LA Knight Riders for the past few weeks, and that a declaration will be made soon. If the batter agrees to break his core contract, which will have an impact on his international career, he will receive a No Objection Certificate.",
        "summary": "* The Major League Cricket tournament in the United States is scheduled to take place from July 13 to July 30.\n* England's opening batter Jason Roy is expected to sign a two-year deal with the Los Angeles Knight Riders team, which may require him to renounce his central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).\n* If Roy signs with the team, he will be the first England national team player to leave his central contract to focus on T20 leagues around the world.\n* Roy's decision may put his spot in the England team for the ODI World Cup 2023 in India at risk.\n* The 32-year-old batter has been in discussions with ECB representatives about joining the LA Knight Riders for several weeks, and an official announcement is expected soon."

        "date": "Fri Jan 24 14:08:00 2025",
        "body": "The Hundred and Major League Cricket (MLC) are among the newest franchise leagues. While the former, run by the England Cricket Board (ECB), is a slightly different format than the rest, MLC was conceived to promote cricket in the United States of America (USA). It has completed two seasons so far.\n\nThough these two franchise tournaments are set to be played this year as well, there could also be issues of overlap that the administrators may face due to the number of T20 leagues and international tournaments being played. This year, the MLC is said to be scheduled somewhere around mid-June to mid-July and finish two weeks before the Hundred which is scheduled to start in early August.\n\nIt is to be noted that the Caribbean Premier League could affect the availability of the West Indian cricketers as the finals of the MLC might overlap due to the long-delayed start of another upcoming new league, the European T20 Premier League (ETPL), which will be hosted by Ireland, Netherlands, and Scotland.\n\nAlso Read: Wankhede Stadium scripts Guinness World Record while marking 50th anniversary\n\nThe Hundred will also look to avoid some fixture clash as well due to the England vs India Test series which will also be played around the same time. This is the reason the two leagues have decided to avoid overlap to make sure they can attract elite overseas players.\n\nThe last few seasons of The Hundred and MLC\n\nThe Hundred started in 2021 when the Southern Brave became the inaugural champions beating the Birmingham Phoenix by 32 runs and was captained by James Vince. The Trent Rockets won the 2022 season while the last two seasons in 2023 and 2024 were won by the Oval Invincibles.\n\nThe MLC has had two seasons so far where MI New York emerged as the inaugural champions beating the Seattle Orcas by seven wickets and were led by West Indies star Nicholas Pooran. The last season was won by Washington Freedom who beat the San Francisco Unicorns by 96 runs.",

        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC), the burgeoning T20 cricket league in the USA, is gearing up for significant growth. Reports indicate that MLC plans to expand from its current six teams to eight by 2027, with potential new franchises in Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Toronto. This move marks a strategic effort to broaden cricket’s footprint in North America, tapping into cricket-loving communities and enhancing the league’s competitive stature.\n\nMLC’s Expansion Strategy\n\nMLC, sanctioned by USA Cricket, has quickly gained traction since its inception, featuring top international players and providing high-quality cricket entertainment. The league currently comprises six teams:\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nMI New York\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nCo-founder Satyan Gajwani expressed the league’s flexibility in its expansion approach, stating, “We have options ahead of us. I don’t think we’re committed one way or the other right now. That’s a decision we will take closer to launch.”\n\nPotential Cities for Expansion\n\nCities like Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Toronto have been shortlisted due to their significant South Asian communities, which traditionally have a strong affinity for cricket. MLC officials have already conducted site visits, with Chicago receiving positive feedback for its local support. Further visits to the other cities are scheduled, with a final decision expected later this year.\n\nPartnerships and Franchise Ownership\n\nThe MLC’s growth is bolstered by the involvement of IPL franchise owners:\n\nMumbai Indians\n\nKolkata Knight Riders\n\nChennai Super Kings\n\nThe Seattle Orcas have a partnership with Delhi Capitals, while the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom collaborate with Cricket Victoria and Cricket NSW, respectively. This blend of IPL and international partnerships enriches the league’s profile and helps attract global talent.\n\nExpanding Cricket’s Reach in North America\n\nGajwani highlighted the importance of growing cricket in the U.S., recognizing the large potential fan base. He noted that while the U.S. sports market is dominated by leagues like the NBA and NFL, there is ample room for cricket to carve out its niche. “America is the largest sports market in the world. It’s also very competitive, and continuing to be relevant will be a challenge. But I think the economics of sport in America are pretty robust.”",
        "summary": "**Expansion Plans**: MLC plans to expand from 6 teams to 8 teams by 2027, with potential new franchises in Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Toronto.\n\n**Current Teams**: The current teams in the league are Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, and Washington Freedom.\n\n**Reason for Expansion**: The expansion aims to broaden cricket's footprint in North America, tapping into cricket-loving communities and enhancing the league's competitive stature.\n\n**Potential Cities**: Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Toronto have been shortlisted due to their significant South Asian communities, which have a strong affinity for cricket.\n\n**Partnerships**: The league has partnerships with IPL franchise owners, including Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, and Chennai Super Kings, which enriches the league's profile and helps attract global talent.\n\n**Goals**: The ultimate goal is to grow cricket in the U.S., recognizing the large potential fan base, and to carve out a niche in the competitive American sports market."
