        "body": "Travis Head, Australia’s aggressive left-handed batter has been one of the most consistent performers in international cricket in the last 3 years. His ability to play with positive intent and apply pressure on the opposition makes him a standout batter at the moment across three formats. Along with international cricket, Travis Head has done well in franchise cricket as well. He has played in the Big Bash League (BBL), Indian Premier League (IPL), and Major League Cricket (MLC) in the last few years. But now, Head has decided that he will not play franchise cricket other than the IPL.\n\nToday, we will see what Travis Head has to say about not playing other franchise leagues and its impact on playing the upcoming SL vs AUS 2025 test series. So let’s start.\n\nI won’t play franchise cricket other than the IPL: Travis Head\n\nAustralia’s star batter Travis Head has made a huge statement on playing franchise cricket ahead of the upcoming SL vs AUS 2025 test series. The left-handed batter said he won’t play franchise cricket other than the IPL. He has taken this decision to manage burnout. Over the fears of burnout and to keep himself fresh for test cricket, Head will not play in any other leagues in the world.\n\nHead also said prioritizing test cricket is a goal for the whole Australian team at the moment. He also talks about the value of those 8 days off in between. Head wanted to put efforts into prioritizing the longest format of the game.\n\nTravis Head, while talking to The Sydney Morning Herald has said that – “Aside from the IPL, I won’t play franchise cricket. If I play in Big Bash at this time, it will be my third team, and I believe that won’t allow me to take that time off. Taking those eight days off and then playing MLC or the Hundred in a few months is quite difficult. Test cricket is currently the most important thing for us as a team, and I am fortunate to have those seven days off on this tour. I therefore wish to give that my best effort.” (Quoted by us).\n\nHead wanted a break after a highly intensive BGT 2024-25\n\nTravis Head has confessed that he needed a break for a while after a highly intensive Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) 2024-25. He was ‘pretty cooked’ after the 5-match IND vs AUS test series and needed a break to keep himself fresh for the upcoming SL vs AUS 2025 test series. He also talks about giving much-needed time to his young family. Head wanted to be involved in the BBL, but a tight schedule is something he cannot do about.\n\n“I needed the break, I was pretty cooked and I was pretty vocal about that, but now I’m feeling good. Our current schedule is a little difficult because we have a young family, but CA and the guys above have made it very clear where they want us to be and what I can play. I would love to be able to play Big Bash. Yes, it’s upsetting, and yes, I would love to be able to participate in the BBL, but I believe that the most important thing for us is to position myself to perform well over the next few weeks. Additionally, with a young family, I feel like I can contribute a little bit there.” – Head added (Quoted by us).\n\nTravis Head was the highest run-scorer in BGT 2024-25\n\nTravis Head continued his red-hot form in the recently concluded BGT 2024-25. He becomes the highest run-scorer in the series with 448 runs in 9 innings. He averaged 56 in the series and scored runs with an outstanding strike rate of 92.56. Even when he failed in the last 3 innings after a first-inning hundred in Brisbane, he played a crucial cameo in a 4th inning run-chase on a difficult pitch in Sydney.\n\nTavis Head will open in SL vs AUS 2025 test series\n\nTravis Head will open the inning in the upcoming SL vs AUS 2025 test series, confirmed stand-in captain Steve Smith. There were temptations in Australia’s team management that Head should open, considering his success in that role in the subcontinent. Head has done well while opening the inning in subcontinent tests. His last assignment in the subcontinent was in India in BGT 2023. He has given a few quick starts to the team while batting at the top.\n\nOpening the inning will give the best chance to Travis Head on those turning tracks in the subcontinent. He will face a hard new ball, and if there is not much turn, he will face a short burst of fast bowling to settle for a challenge against the quality spinners.\n\nAs far as Sam Konstas is concerned, the team might find a place for him somewhere in the middle order. He has opened the inning in the last two tests against India in BGT 2024-25.\n\nFAQs:-\n\n(1) Why has Travis Head decided to only play the IPL but not the other leagues?\n\nIPL is the biggest franchise cricket league in the world. He might also play in the other leagues in the future, but for a while, he will only play the IPL as far as franchise cricket is concerned. The IPL has the most money, fame, and brand value compared to other leagues worldwide.\n\n(2) How many runs Head has scored in IPL 2024?\n\nHead scored 567 runs in IPL 2024 while playing for SRH.",
