        "date": "Sun Jan 12 00:05:47 2025",
        "body": "Steven Smith scored a brilliant hundred in the Big Bash League against Perth Scorchers. Steven Smith played a quick-fire knock as he smashed 121 in just 64 balls and smashed 7 fours and 10 sixes. He looked very comfortable playing the shorter format on the wicket and had shots all over the ground. He cashed in during the powerplay overs and played with a very healthy strike rate throughout.\n\nSmith led the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) champions Washington Freedom with equal brilliance. At a strike rate of 148.67, he scored 336 runs in nine games, including three half-centuries. Even more amazing was the fact that Smith was participating in his maiden BBL match after spending the previous two months playing Test cricket.\n\nIn the 2024–25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, he recently hammered two hundred as Australia defeated India 3–1 to win the series. Steve Smith unexpectedly failed to sell at last November’s Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 auction. He charged ₹2 crore as his base pricing. His performances in BBL have caught the eyes of experts lauding him for the opening spot.\n\nSteven Smith Could Seriously Open For Australia In T20Is\n\nAfter Steve Smith’s explosive century in the 2024–25 Big Bash League (BBL), former England captain Michael Vaughan and former India spinner Harbhajan Singh have praised the former Australian captain. Against the Perth Scorchers at SCG on Saturday, January 11, the Sydney Sixers opener famously hammered an undefeated 121 runs off 64 balls at an incredible strike rate of 189.06, which included seven maximums and ten boundaries. In the Australian T20 league, this was Smith’s third century.\n\nVaughan lauded Smith, “the opener”, writing on X:\n\n“Steve Smith is a seriously good T20 opener these days … #bigbash”\n\nReplying to the post, Harbhajan tagged Smith and shared similar sentiments:\n\n“Always been a good player in any format. Reliable”\n\nSteven Smith On Selectors Ignoring Him For T20Is.\n\nAfter his stellar performance in the BBL, Steve Smith told selectors that he was eligible for T20Is. According to Fox Cricket (via nine.com.au), the 35-year-old stated:\n\n“They’re a bit off me there, aren’t they? I’m available for selection, but there’s plenty of good batters around the country, isn’t there? And I’m getting older,”\n\nSteven Smith has amassed 5734 runs at a strike rate of 129.71 in 256 Twenty20 matches, including 27 half-centuries and four tons. In 32 BBL games, he has amassed 1147 runs. However, the batter from New South Wales has a lackluster T20I record for Australia. In 67 games, he has only amassed 1094 runs with a strike rate of 125.45, five of which have been fifty runs.\n\nIn February 2024, he played his final Twenty20 International match against New Zealand. The Australians lost in the semifinals of the 2024 T20 World Cup after the senior batter was benched.\n\nAlso Read : https://goworldwide.co.in/pat-cummins-the-no-1-captain-in-the-world/",
