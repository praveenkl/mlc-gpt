But before that, the team’s bowling coach Munaf Patel has got a new responsibility. In fact, Seattle Orcas, a team of the US T20 tournament Major League Cricket (MLC), has appointed its bowling coach for the new season. In such a situation, the question arises whether Munaf Patel will leave Delhi Capitals midway and go to America?\n\nWill he leave IPL for MLC?\n\nIPL 2025 will be played from March 22 to May 25. At the same time, MLC 2025 is expected to start in June. This means that Munaf Patel will go to America but for this he will not need to leave Delhi Capitals. After the tournament is over, he will join the Seattle Orcas team. Apart from this, GMR Group has a stake in both Delhi Capitals and Seattle Orcas.\n\nIn this way, Munaf is a part of the ecosystem of the DC franchise. Along with him, Matthew Mott will be the head coach of the team, while Venugopal Rao will work as the Director of Cricket. All three have experience of working together in both IPL and MLC. At the same time, England’s legendary batsman Ian Bell has joined Seattle Orcas as a batting coach.\n\nMunaf has a long experience\n\nMunaf Patel has also been a part of the support staff of Delhi Capitals in IPL.
