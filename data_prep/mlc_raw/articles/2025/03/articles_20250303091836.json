        "title": "Steve Smith signs £200k deal to play in the Hundred",
        "date": "Tue Feb 25 09:00:00 2025",
        "body": "There has been criticism over the past two years that the competition, launched in 2021, was failing to attract big names. Last year a host of Australian stars opted to play in America’s Major League Cricket (MLC) instead of the Hundred because the salaries were bigger and the two tournaments overlapped in the calendar. That has been avoided this year, with the MLC being played before the Hundred.\n\nSmith will be joined at the tournament by his Australian team-mate Marcus Stoinis, who will earn £200,000 at Trent Rockets, while Northern Superchargers, coached by Andrew Flintoff, have signed the South African David Miller at the top salary bracket. Several high-profile New Zealand players have been signed, with Trent Boult, on the top-level salary, joining Tim Southee at Birmingham Phoenix.\n\nKane Williamson, the former New Zealand captain, has signed for London Spirit but on a much lower salary bracket than some of the other marquee overseas signings, being paid £78,500 for the three-week competition. Williamson, 34, has also signed for Middlesex for the 2025 season and will play in the County Championship and T20 Blast as well as undertaking some ambassadorial work for the Hundred and MCC.\n\nThe influence of the new owners who bought equity stakes in the teams this month is already apparent. Smith has previously played for the MLC side Washington Freedom, whose owners bought a 50 per cent share in Welsh Fire, and Khan is part of the Mumbai Indians group, who have bought a 49 per cent stake in Oval Invincibles.\n\nThe direct signings, and decisions on which players to retain from last year, marks the first stage of building Hundred teams for the 2025 competition. Each team also has a designated, centrally contracted England player, with those picks to be made this week. The player draft comes next, on March 12, and then each team will be allowed to select two wildcards at the end of the Vitality T20 Blast group stages in June, to reward strong performances in that competition.\n\nBen Stokes, the England Test captain, will not play in this year’s tournament as he looks to protect his body and manage his workload before the winter Ashes series. The Hundred begins on August 5, the day after the five-match Test series against India is due to end, and both Stokes and the England management are mindful of what happened last year when the all-rounder sustained a serious injury while playing for the Superchargers.\n\nStokes has been replaced by Harry Brook at the Superchargers while Ben Duckett is Birmingham Phoenix’s England player. Joe Root remains at Trent Bridge as the Rockets’ designated England star, Jos Buttler will stay at Manchester Originals and Jofra Archer at Southern Brave. London Spirit and Welsh Fire will be able to pick one of the remaining centrally contracted players later this week. Only players on a full, Test and white-ball deal are eligible for this pick.\n\nOllie Pope is already on London Spirit’s roster at a lower band, and it is likely that Jamie Smith will be signed by the Lord’s-based team, replacing their previous England player Dan Lawrence. That would leave Welsh Fire to pick from Mark Wood, Rehan Ahmed, Zak Crawley or Chris Woakes. Any remaining England players who are not allocated to a team can go back into the player draft next month.\n\nEach of the eight men’s and women’s team had until Monday to decide which players they wanted to retain from last year and they were able to keep up to ten from last year’s list. Oval Invincibles men have held on to the core of their team and will only be making two picks at the player draft whereas Manchester Originals and Welsh Fire have had something of a clearout and have eight spots to fill at the draft.\n\nIn the women’s competition, the Australian stars Meg Lanning and Megan Schutt and South Africa’s Laura Wolvaardt are among the big-name signings that have been made directly while Ellyse Perry and Beth Mooney, two other Australians, have been retained by their franchises.",
        "summary": "* There was a previous concern that the Hundred tournament was not attracting big names, with some Australian stars opting to play in MLC instead due to higher salaries and overlapping schedules.\n* However, this year's schedule has been adjusted to avoid the overlap, and several high-profile players have been signed, including Steve Smith, Marcus Stoinis, and David Miller.\n* The new owners of the Hundred teams have also had an influence, with Smith having previously played for the MLC side Washington Freedom, whose owners now have a stake in Welsh Fire.\n* Notable absences include Ben Stokes, who will not play in the tournament to manage his workload before the winter Ashes series.\n\nThere is no other information about the MLC tournament in this article. The majority of the article discusses the Hundred tournament, including player signings, salary brackets, and team roster building."

        "title": "Anupama Chopra on Motherhood, and Agni Chopra’s Cricketing Journey - Sports News Portal",
        "date": "Wed Feb 26 10:24:23 2025",
        "body": "Agni Chopra caught everyone’s attention after he became the most expensive player in the Major League Cricket (MLC) draft for MI New York, and his story is certainly interesting. Anupama Chopra, celebrated film critic and journalist, recently found herself in a new role, mother to one of the most sought-after players in MLC. In an exclusive chat with RevSportz, Anupama opened up about Agni’s passion for cricket, her journey as a mother watching him grow, and the challenges that come with his chosen career path.\n\nFor a family deeply immersed in cinema, Agni’s love for cricket came as a surprise. “When he was around five years old, he told me, ‘I need to play cricket,’” Anupama recalled. “It was strange because I have no knowledge or deep interest in the game. Our lives at home revolved around movies. So it was just out of the blue when he said that he wanted to play cricket. I remember taking him to Shivaji Park because that was the only place where a five-year-old would be allowed to get on the field and knock a ball around. It was just something in him from a very young age.”\n\nAnupama admits that, unlike seasoned cricketing parents, she lacks the technical expertise to analyse his game. However, she has learned to observe his temperament. “Truthfully, I don’t know a lot about the game, so I have no ability to watch him and judge if he’s getting better or worse,” she says. “He’s very Zen-like. Even when he does well, there isn’t great emotion, and when he does badly, there isn’t any either. That detachment is crucial in sport.”\n\nWhen asked about whether she sees any similarities between the stories of struggle her husband, Vidhu, portrays on the big screen and her son’s journey in sports, she acknowledged that unlike many young cricketers who fight against significant financial or social odds, Agni comes from a background of privilege.\n\n“Agni has been born into great privilege, and he should always be grateful for that,” said Anupama. “Those basic struggles of roti, kapda, makaan, he doesn’t have. But that other struggle—of making yourself, of just showing up, day after day—that’s a big one.\n\n“It would be unfair to compare his struggle to those who have had to fight for roti, kapda, makaan. But the struggle to make a place for yourself in the most competitive sport in this country is real. The discipline to show up every day, even when you don’t get picked, even when there’s no light at the end of the tunnel—that’s a different kind of battle.”\n\nShe compared her son’s dedication to that of her husband, likening the journey to that of the uncertainty of filmmaking.\n\n“When Vinod makes a film, you have no idea how it will turn out,” she explains. “You just believe and keep going. That’s the parallel I see with Agni—keeping the faith and putting in the work, even when you don’t know where it will lead.”\n\nThe highs and lows of sport can be difficult to navigate, especially for a mother. Yet, Anupama has found guidance in her own life experiences. She recalls how, when Vinod’s film Kareeb didn’t perform well at the box office, he told her, “Don’t get attached. It’s not about the end goal; it’s about the joy of doing it at all.”\n\nShe applies the same philosophy to Agni’s career. “I’m learning from him—to stay in the moment, to not get too attached to either success or failure,” she says. “What matters is the work he puts in. If it works, it works. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t. That’s beyond our control.”\n\nDespite her efforts to remain detached from the results, some moments are simply too big to be understated—The MI New York draft pick was naturally one such occasion. “It was a big celebratory moment,” Anupama admits with a laugh. “I’m not Zen at all—he is! It’s a wonderful opportunity, a new journey for him, and we’re all just so excited.”\n\nAs Agni Chopra steps on to the international stage but his mother, Anupama continues to stand on the sidelines applauding his journey while also ensuring he remains grounded in gratitude.",
        "summary": "* Agni Chopra, son of film critic and journalist Anupama Chopra, was drafted as the most expensive player by MI New York in the Major League Cricket (MLC).\n* This milestone marks a new chapter in Agni's cricketing career, and his mother is excited about the opportunity.\n* There is no additional information about the MLC tournament format, schedule, or other players in the article, as the focus is on Agni's background and his mother's perspective on his journey."
