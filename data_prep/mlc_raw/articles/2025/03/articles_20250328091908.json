The league has projected that the games will deliver a $3m (£2.3m/€2.8m) direct economic boost to Oakland.\n\nThe Coliseum will host seven game days and nine matches, starting on June 12 and continuing until June 18. The stadium will be adapted to accommodate professional cricket matches, with specialised drop-in turf wickets to be installed to meet international standards.\n\nAfter the games in Oakland, the season will move to Grand Prairie, Texas from June 20-29 before heading to Broward County Stadium in Florida from July 1-6.

This move underscores Oakland’s status as a diverse and dynamic sports city, and we look forward to supporting the growth of cricket in our community.”\n\nLast year marked the Coliseum’s final season as the home of the A’s, with the team set to move to a new ballpark in Las Vegas in 2028. The A’s will spend three seasons in Sacramento before moving to Las Vegas.\n\nThe Coliseum also hosted the NFL’s Raiders until 2019, when the team moved to Las Vegas.\n\nFollowing the departure of the A’s, USL Championship soccer club Oakland Roots agreed a deal to play at the Coliseum from 2025. It marks the team’s return to the city following a three-year absence.\n\nIn October, the City of Oakland reached an amended agreement with the African American Sports and Entertainment Group (AASEG) to speed up the process for development work at the Coliseum.\n\nAASEG is planning on carrying out a major renovation of the Coliseum site, which also includes the Oakland Arena. The group is set to develop thousands of new units of affordable housing and increased outdoor space, while preserving the Oakland Arena.",

But right at the last moment that failed.\"\n\nNow helming America's well-heeled T20 franchise competition, Grave starts his tenure with the big news that MLC will launch its season at the Coliseum.\n\nForbesMajor League Cricket’s New Season Will Start At The Iconic Oakland Coliseum\n\nThere will be nine matches played in Oakland from June 12-18 as it becomes the new home of San Francisco Unicorns, a franchise backed by Silicon Valley venture capitalists.\n\n\"It was nice in the first week in the job to be able to reconnect with the guys in Oakland and say 'look this time, we might well be able to get cricket played at the Coliseum', which everyone knows from the Raiders, A's and from Moneyball and everything else. It's such an iconic venue,\" Grave said.\n\nThe announcement has made an immediate splash and was reported in several major American publications, including The New York Times and Axios. MLC's future at the Coliseum is unknown - it is currently a one-season arrangement - but hopes are high that it can be extended long-term and perhaps even be used as an Olympic venue.\n\nA lively atmosphere, with around 12,000 fans tipped, at the MLC matches could sway Los Angeles 2028 decision makers. Cricket will end a 128-year Olympic drought but venues have yet to be determined, with the men's and women's competitions possibly extending beyond Los Angeles.\n\nLA 2028 local committee chair Casey Wasserman did reveal late last year that the cricket competition could be played on the east coast although he did not name specific cities.\n\nNew York did stage eight T20 World Cup matches in June at its $30 million modular stadium in Long Island. The cricket ground was torn down immediately after the tournament, but billionaire Mukesh Ambani, the owner of MI New York in the MLC, reportedly has plans to build a world-class facility in the famous city.\n\nExpansion is set for MLC with two teams to be added to the six-side tournament in 2027. Philadelphia, Atlanta and Chicago are on the shortlist with infrastructure a key staple and the successful cities could also be in the running to host Olympic matches.\n\nAs I reported last year, officials from the Bay Area and Seattle want to be in the mix to host cricket matches at the Los Angeles Olympics. Given its world-renowned status, and now granted a big stage to showcase its ability to host cricket matches, the Coliseum might just have the inside running.\n\n\"I certainly think that Oakland is a great option, being on the west coast and being such an iconic venue, and one that has such permanent capacity,\" Grave said. \"We are looking to work with USA Cricket to host games and teams in the build-up to the L.A. Games.\n\n\"The U.S. is a big growth area that most boards have identified, including the ICC, as a way to grow the sport.\n\n\"We'll be encouraging and inviting as many teams to come and play the U.S. team in one of our stadiums and create as much fanfare around the L.A. Games.\"",

        "date": "Thu Mar 27 07:08:51 2025",
        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) has officially announced that its 2025 season will open at the legendary Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, marking a historic first for the Bay Area and the entire West Coast. The move brings the second-most popular sport in the world to one of America’s most iconic sports venues, as MLC prepares for its biggest and most ambitious season yet.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with cricexec the night before the announcement, MLC CEO Johnny Grave emphasized the significance of the move: “To be launching the season in such an iconic venue here in Oakland at the Coliseum, which everyone knows from the Raiders and from the A’s, from Moneyball—it’s such a part of U.S. sporting heritage and history. For us to be taking the first ever cricket games here is a dramatic, symbolic moment.”\n\nA coast-to-coast summer of cricket\n\nThe 2025 MLC season will run from June 12 to July 13, with 34 matches played across three major venues: Oakland Coliseum (June 12–18), Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas (June 20–29), and Broward County Stadium in Florida (July 1–6). The playoffs and finals will be held back at Grand Prairie from July 8–13. This marks the first time in MLC’s history that matches will be played on both coasts.\n\n“Whether you’re in the Bay Area, South Florida, or Dallas, the best cricketers in the world are coming to town,” Grave told cricexec. “And they’re playing under lights, in proper stadiums, in a compact, high-energy tournament.”\n\nOakland will host seven game days and nine total matches, including home games for the San Francisco Unicorns, who will play at the Coliseum for the first time. David White, CEO of the Unicorns, called the move “an unforgettable matchday experience in one of the region’s most iconic venues.”\n\nBringing the MLC to the Bay\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns co-owners Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan also commented on bringing Major League Cricket to the Bay Area: “The arrival of this sport at a world-class venue like the Oakland Coliseum, and the opportunity to have the Unicorns play in its home market, is a dream come true for us,” said Rajaraman. “We are fully committed to making the Unicorns a key part of the Bay Area’s sporting culture and providing fans with an exciting and memorable cricket experience.”\n\nHarinarayan added, “The passion for cricket in the Bay Area is undeniable, and we are thrilled to have a home that can accommodate and inspire our growing fanbase. We look forward to an incredible season ahead.”\n\nTransforming a legendary venue for cricket\n\nWhile historically known for hosting NFL and MLB games, the Coliseum will undergo a transformation to accommodate professional cricket. Drop-in turf wickets meeting international standards will be installed, ensuring a high-quality playing surface.\n\n“The Coliseum is a fantastic location for Major League Cricket,” said Grave. “Coming to the West Coast, and being here in Oakland, is an historic move for cricket globally. It reinforces our commitment to growing the game in the United States and providing fans with an exceptional cricket experience.”\n\nThe move also delivers economic impact. The season is expected to bring a $3 million direct economic boost to Oakland, adding new energy and visibility to a venue that has long been central to the city’s sports identity.\n\nCity leaders praised the decision. “The Oakland Coliseum has long been a destination for sports and entertainment, and we are excited to add cricket to its continuing legacy,” said Interim Mayor Kevin Jenkins. “This move underscores Oakland’s status as a diverse and dynamic sports city.”\n\nOakland City Council Member Rebecca Kaplan called cricket’s arrival “fabulous,” noting that the Bay Area has “the largest proportion of cricket fans in America, and the most passionate!”\n\nA broader strategy to grow the game\n\nThe West Coast debut is part of a much larger strategy by MLC to expand its geographic footprint and fan base.\n\n“We want to attract as many fans as we possibly can,” Grave told cricexec. “And our message to the core cricket fans—those from South Asian, Caribbean, or British backgrounds—is: bring your friends.”\n\nHe added, “We’re embracing the Bay Area, getting obviously the fans here behind their local team, the San Francisco Unicorns, but also just coming to support Major League Cricket.”\n\nThis focus on regional identity is a key tenet of Grave’s strategy to build lasting fan engagement. In his interview with cricexec, he spoke about the need for permanent home venues and community connection: “Our aim is for every summer to feel like a can’t-miss event when Major League Cricket comes to town.”\n\nThe commercial and cultural opportunity\n\nThe 2025 season builds on MLC’s commercial growth as well. Title sponsor Cognizant remains at the forefront, with Surya Gummadi, President of Cognizant Americas, noting that cricket’s rapid rise in the U.S. makes it an ideal complement to the brand’s broader portfolio.\n\n“Cricket is rapidly gaining traction in the United States,” said Gummadi, “with a growing fan base who are passionate about the sport, and we are excited about both the expansion of the league into new markets and the future of cricket in the United States.”\n\nNicole Strange, GM of the Coliseum and Oakland Arena (ASM Global), called the arrival of MLC “an incredible opportunity for the Bay Area community and beyond to experience this global sport right here in the heart of Oakland.”\n\nWhat it means\n\nFrom symbolism to economics to visibility, the launch of the 2025 MLC season at the Oakland Coliseum is a statement—about cricket’s ambitions in America and Oakland’s ongoing relevance as a sports city.\n\n“The fact that if you live on the West Coast or you live in the center or on the East Coast, there is going to be a week of matches for you to fly down and attend… that’s the most exciting thing,” Grave told cricexec. “Cricket of this caliber has never been played on the West Coast. That’s what makes this special.”\n\nFans can now sign up for pre-sale ticket access at www.majorleaguecricket.com. Base tickets will start at just $20, aiming to make the experience accessible to all.\n\nFrom the Bay Area to Broward County, MLC’s 2025 season promises to be a turning point for cricket in America—and Oakland is leading the way.",

        "body": "In a significant move for cricket in the United States, Oakland Coliseum—formerly home to the Oakland Athletics—will host nine Major League Cricket (MLC) matches during the 2025 season. This historic venue will become MLC’s third stadium, following Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Broward County Stadium in Florida, where the league’s first two seasons were played.\n\nA New Era for Oakland Coliseum\n\nThe Coliseum, which has hosted baseball and American football since 1966, will undergo modifications to accommodate cricket. Planned changes include reducing the stadium’s capacity to 12,000 and installing drop-in pitches to meet international cricket standards.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics departed the Coliseum at the end of the 2023 MLB season, as the franchise plans to relocate to Las Vegas. This transition has opened the door for cricket to make its mark on the West Coast, with the Coliseum becoming the first venue in the region to host top-tier cricket matches.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns to Call Coliseum Home\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns, 2024 MLC runners-up, will play three home games at the Coliseum. David White, the Unicorns’ CEO, highlighted the importance of bringing cricket to the region:\n\n“The Bay Area has a deep and growing love for cricket. This move allows us to create an unforgettable match-day experience in one of the region’s most iconic venues.”\n\nThe 2025 MLC season will kick off at the Coliseum on June 12, featuring a rematch of last season’s final between the Unicorns and Washington Freedom, coached by Ricky Ponting.\n\nEconomic and Cultural Impact\n\nAccording to MLC, the Coliseum will provide a $3 million (USD) direct economic boost to Oakland during the 2025 season. Johnny Grave, MLC’s newly appointed chief executive, emphasized the significance of bringing cricket to the West Coast:\n\n“The Coliseum is a fantastic location for Major League Cricket, and we are thrilled by the prospect of some of the world’s biggest cricket stars playing in such an iconic Californian venue. This move reinforces our commitment to growing the game in the United States and providing fans with an exceptional cricket experience.”\n\nMLC’s Growing Global Appeal\n\nMLC’s popularity continues to rise, attracting international cricket stars such as Rashid Khan, Nicholas Pooran, and Heinrich Klaasen, all of whom have been retained by their franchises. However, Pat Cummins will miss the 2025 season due to Australia’s Test tour of the West Indies.\n\nTo avoid scheduling conflicts with The Hundred, MLC has planned its 2025 final for July 12, allowing players to participate in both tournaments.\n\nFuture Expansion Plans\n\nMLC is set to expand in the coming years, with potential new venues being considered in Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Toronto. This expansion aligns with MLC’s goal of growing cricket’s footprint across North America.\n\nWith the addition of the Oakland Coliseum, Major League Cricket is set to deliver an unprecedented cricket experience to West Coast fans, marking a new chapter in the sport’s growth across the United States.",
