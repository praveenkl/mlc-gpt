        "title": "Major League Cricket coming to the Oakland Coliseum for historic June tournament",
        "date": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "Cricket will be making its debut on the West Coast of the United States when Major League Cricket hosts a seven-day, nine-match event at the Oakland Coliseum. The Coliseum event, which runs June 12-18, will feature the first top-tier cricket matches played on the West Coast.\n\nThe week-long event kicks off MLC’s third season and will be the first leg of a three-city schedule for MLC that will continue to Grand Prairie, Texas, and then to Lauderhill, Fla., before culminating in a championship match. It is the first time MLC has hosted matches in California and Florida. The 34-match schedule is its biggest so far and the largest top-tier cricket schedule ever hosted in the U.S.\n\n“Season three (of MLC) is a big step up, not just in the number of matches, but also the venues that we’re going through too,” MLC CEO Johnny Grave said. “Major League Cricket continues to grow with some of the best players in the world coming for this month of cricket celebration. We’re serious about growing the game.”\n\nThough not yet one of the major sports in the U.S., cricket is the second-most followed sport in the world and has continued to gain prominence in this country, especially following the national team’s upset over traditional power Pakistan in the 2024 Men’s Cricket World Cup. Some of the sport’s top players participate in MLC, which runs its season to fit into the international cricket calendar.\n\nMLC has six teams, including three West Coast clubs — the San Francisco Unicorns, Los Angeles Knight Riders and Seattle Orcas. According to the league, more than 100 million people streamed MLC matches or watched them on television around the world last year. The league plays in a Twenty-20 or T20 format, which is a more condensed version of traditional cricket matches and comprises two, 120-ball innings, one per team. T20 matches generally run a similar length to a baseball game.\n\nGrave estimates that roughly $1 billion will be invested into growing cricket in the U.S. ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where the sport will return for the first time in more than 100 years.\n\n“Hopefully (the MLC tournament is) a big statement as to how big we think the sport can be in this country,” Grave said.\n\nThe MLC event comes to the Coliseum during a transitional period for the historic venue, which opened its doors in 1965 and until this season had annually hosted either professional U.S. football or Major League Baseball games (or both). The Oakland Raiders moved to Las Vegas ahead of the 2020 NFL season and the Oakland Athletics left the Coliseum at the end of the 2024 MLB season.\n\nIn their place, the Coliseum is now home to the USL Championship league Oakland Roots soccer team, which broke a team record with more than 26,000 fans at their home opener last Saturday. MLC is hoping for similar-sized crowds for its event, which will include evening matches during the week and weekend day/night doubleheaders. General admission tickets are $20 and went on sale Wednesday morning on the MLC website.\n\n“Bringing more of this kind of activity to the Coliseum brings the community together, and also creates jobs, and improves revenue to fund vital public services. Our region has the largest proportion of cricket fans in America, and the most passionate,” Oakland City Council member Rebecca Kaplan, who also serves in leadership on the board of the Coliseum Authority, said in a statement.\n\nBecause of its dimensions and location, the Oakland Coliseum has been an appealing target for those interested in hosting major cricket events in the U.S.\n\nIn 2022, Grave said the ICC was close to an agreement to have the Coliseum host 2024 Cricket World Cup matches before the negotiations fell through. Now that MLC is officially hosting matches at the Coliseum, Grave is hopeful that they will be able to continue to hold events there in the coming years. He believes playing at a venue like the Coliseum “will hopefully turn a few heads and get Americans to think that there’s a reason why cricket is the second-biggest sport, because it’s one of the most exciting sports you can watch.”\n\n“If we can bring the best stars in the world to the Bay Area, to such an iconic venue like the Coliseum, playing in the shortest format of the game played under lights, so people can go after school and work, then hopefully it’s a winning formula to not just provide fantastic entertainment to loyal sports fans of the Coliseum, but also for cricket fans in the Bay Area,” Grave said.\n\nLocally, playing matches in Oakland will be a boon for the San Francisco Unicorns, who will get to compete in front of their hometown fans for the first time (all previous season MLC matches were played in Texas or North Carolina). The Unicorns feature several internationally renowned cricket players, including Haris Rauf, opening bowler for the Pakistan national team, and Jake Fraser-McGurk, a member of the Australian national team who is currently playing in the Indian Premier League, as well as a local rising star, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, who attends San Jose State University.\n\n“We’re very excited about bringing games to the Bay Area and to the very high-density South Asian market that lives here in the Bay Area because we know that cricket is more than a game to them — it’s a religion,” San Francisco Unicorns CEO David White said.\n\n“We know from all the stats and fan data that there’s a huge audience for cricket in the Bay Area,” Grave added.\n\nWhite spent last Saturday at the Roots home opener and was thrilled with the atmosphere the Roots brought to the Coliseum.\n\n“They did a fantastic job,” White said. “We’ll be looking to replicate our own version of that.”\n\nThe Coliseum has the largest baseball playing surface in the U.S. and can therefore be most easily converted into an international standard cricket field. Though the Coliseum has seen numerous field conversions over the years when the Raiders and A’s shared the stadium, the process of converting the Coliseum to feature a full-sized cricket playing surface will be unique.\n\nCricket utilizes a 22-yard strip called a wicket that will need to be “dropped into” the Coliseum playing surface. The wicket that will be utilized at the Coliseum is currently in Nassau County, N.Y., where it was most recently used at the World Cup. The strip, which sits on a metal plate, will be trucked out to Oakland in two pieces. It will live in the parking lot of the stadium until it can be installed ahead of the MLC event and then uninstalled as soon as the event ends, so the Roots can continue their home schedule.\n\nThis field conversion process is commonplace in Australia and New Zealand, where professional cricket matches are often played in the same stadiums as Australian Rules Football matches, but it is rare in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to the tournament, MLC plans to make further investment into growing cricket in the Bay Area and around the U.S. MLC runs Minor League Cricket that develops talent throughout the country, and White said the Unicorns are looking into building a youth program in the Bay Area and eventually building a permanent cricket stadium for the team.\n\n“We want to make sure we’re getting more kids into the game because we ultimately know that’s the starting point,” White said.\n\nEducating those in the U.S. without a cricket background about the game remains one of MLC’s top priorities, but White is optimistic that the more exposure cricket gets to a U.S. audience, the more popular it will become.\n\n“I do feel like there’s a strong appetite to learn it as it’s not a hard entry-point game,” White said, comparing it to baseball. “Someone bowls a ball, same as pitching it, and then someone hits it, and the farther they hit it, the more runs they get. So it’s, in that sense, quite easy to learn.\n\n“There (are) obviously some nuances within the rules, but when you see exciting things happen on a regular basis (in the matches), that tends to excite people who want to come along.”\n\n(Top photo of the Coliseum in 2024: Eakin Howard / Getty Images)",

        "date": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "Major League Cricket, the U.S’ well-heeled T20 competition, will launch its third season at the iconic Oakland Coliseum in a “big statement of intent” amid a billion-dollar project aimed to jolt cricket in the world’s biggest sports market.\n\nThere will be nine matches played in Oakland from June 12-18 before the 34-game, monthlong tournament shifts to Dallas, with its former baseball stadium in Grand Prairie becoming the hub of American cricket, and then Broward County in Florida.\n\nThe playoffs and final will be played in Dallas, which along with the more modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, hosted all the games across MLC’s first two seasons.\n\nIt will be the first time the competition, which has attracted some of the world’s best players in its fledgling years, has expanded to new surroundings. The move to the Coliseum has been mooted for a while, and touted as a potential cricket venue for the Los Angeles Olympics, but will undoubtedly be a big deal and hoped to reel in non-cricket fans to MLC games.\n\nAfter a long search far and wide, it will be the home of San Francisco Unicorns, a franchise backed by Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who have become the second team after the Texas Super Kings to secure a ground.\n\n“It’s such an iconic venue and it’s a big statement of intent from the league in terms of how serious the owners are about growing the sport. It’s part of a billion dollar project to grow cricket in this country,” new MLC chief executive Johnny Grave told me.\n\nThe venue will be reshaped to the field dimensions of cricket, which differ markedly to baseball, and specialized drop-in turf wickets will be installed. The slate of matches is projected to deliver a $3 million economic boost to Oakland.\n\nLocated near Interstate 880, with its stunning views of the Oakland hills a favorite for many seated in the terraces, the Coliseum hosted almost 5000 baseball games and is where the Athletics called home for 57 years.\n\nNFL team Oakland Raiders also played there for many years before those beloved franchises were lured to the bright lights of Las Vegas. For a wider audience, the Coliseum might be best known for being immortalized in the hit 2011 film Moneyball starring Brad Pitt.\n\nThere is somewhat of a sports vacuum in the East Bay, with the hunger from locals evident after a lively crowd of more than 26,000 turned up for a USL - a second tier soccer league - match at the weekend.\n\nThe Coliseum has around 40,000 seats, but MLC matches are hoped to initially attract about 12,000 fans.\n\n“I think we’re certainly focused on trying to fill the lower bowl as a starting point, which would give us the biggest crowds we’ve ever had for Major League Cricket,” Grave said. \"We know there’s loads and loads of cricket fans in the Bay Area. We really want them to bring their non-cricket fans to have a taste of the sport.\n\n“It (Coliseum) obviously has that large appeal with the Oakland sports community. There’s a big desire and appetite to keep high-level sport in the Bay Area. What we’ve got is as good as it gets in terms of international players and quality of cricket.”\n\nThe well-respected Grave steps into a coveted role after edging out several high-profile candidates, including Australia’s Big Bash League boss Alistair Dobson. Grave was the Cricket West Indies chief for seven years up until late last year and before that was commercial director at the Professional Cricketers’ Association in England for almost a decade.\n\nHis relationships with cricket administrators in the Caribbean and England will be key amid a clash of seasons in the northern hemisphere. There has been particular angst from powerhouse England towards MLC, which has tried to lure some of its top players previously, but this upcoming season will be the earliest start in the tournament’s short history. It is also the biggest in terms of games and length as MLC eyes expansion with two teams set to join the inaugural six franchises in 2027.\n\n“We think probably mid-June to mid-July is about right,\" Grave said. \"There will obviously be times where we have to clash and overlap a little bit, but certainly that won’t be the intention. Fingers crossed, we can keep it on an even keel.\n\n\"Our focus is very much on the U.S and the home market. All the games will be in the evening, while the afternoon-daytime matches will be doubleheaders on the weekend.\n\n“We’re trying to own the calendar for a month in T20 cricket in this part of the world and position it very much as a league for the U.S. market. We’re also very much targeting the best white-ball players in the world to come to MLC and entertain fans here.”",
        "summary": "**Season Details:**\n\n* The third season of MLC will start on June 12 and run for a month.\n* The tournament will consist of 34 games, with nine matches played in Oakland from June 12-18.\n* The action will then shift to Dallas and later to Broward County in Florida.\n* The playoffs and final will take place in Dallas.\n\n**New Venue:**\n\n* The iconic Oakland Coliseum will host MLC matches for the first time, with a seating capacity of around 40,000.\n* The venue will be reshaped to fit cricket field dimensions, and specialized drop-in turf wickets will be installed.\n* The matches are expected to attract around 12,000 fans initially, with a goal to fill the lower bowl.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n* The tournament is projected to deliver a $3 million economic boost to Oakland.\n* MLC aims to attract non-cricket fans to the games, leveraging the iconic venue's appeal to the Oakland sports community.\n\n**New CEO:**\n\n* Johnny Grave, former Cricket West Indies chief, has taken over as the new CEO of MLC.\n* Grave plans to build relationships with cricket administrators in the Caribbean and England to avoid clashing with their seasons.\n\n**Future Plans:**\n\n* MLC plans to expand with two new teams joining the six existing franchises in 2027.\n* The goal is to position MLC as a league for the U.S. market, targeting the best white-ball players in the world to participate."

World-class Major League Cricket games will be played there for the first time.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns, one of the league's founding teams, will finally have home-field advantage.\n\nDespite the Oakland A's following the Oakland Raiders in leaving this iconic stadium, the second largest sport in the world will be taking their place this summer.\n\nMLC leaders say this will bring in some of the best cricket players in the world.\n\nThis means the Oakland Coliseum will become the first stadium in North America to host the two most popular sports in the world, soccer and cricket, as the Oakland Roots just played their first soccer game at the Coliseum over the weekend.\n\nMORE: Historic night for Oakland Roots with sell-out crowd at 1st home game at Oakland Coliseum\n\nFor those who don't know much about the sport of cricket, just know that Saurabh Netravalkar is a big deal. He helped the U.S. national cricket team bet powerhouse Pakistan at last year's World Cup.\n\n\"So it was a really close game. It was tied on scores. And that went to a Super Over. It's like a penalty shoot-out in soccer. And that over was balled by me,\" says Netravalkar with a big smile.\n\nAnd now, the man whose day job is software engineer at Oracle, is bringing his game to the Coliseum.\n\n\"About six years ago, a bunch of us got together and said, 'Look, the time is right to bring cricket to the U.S.'\" says Anand Rajaraman, a Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur and co-owner of the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nSan Francisco is one of six teams that currently make up the league, which includes Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas, New York City, and Washington, D.C, the team Netravalkar plays for.\n\nThe league kicks off its third season in June.\n\nRELATED: Everything Bay Area baseball fans need to know about cricket before MLC games at Oakland Coliseum\n\n\"So, even though we were the San Francisco Unicorns, we never played at home until this season. And so, I'm so excited to being playing in front of our home crowd,\" Rajaraman.\n\nMLC picked the Oakland Coliseum because it's the only stadium in North American big enough for a cricket field.\n\nWhen asked why it has taken so long for cricket to catch on in the United States, Johnny Grave, CEO Major League Cricket responds by saying: \"That's a really good questions. But it is definitely here now. We are part of a billion invest of the sport it this country.\"\n\nHe hopes the popularity of cricket will gain momentum leading up the L.A. Olympics in 2028, in which cricket makes its Olympic return.\n\nThe season will be short - just one month. But that allows for top players from around world to take time off from other leagues to play here. Some earning upwards of $80,000.\n\nCricket matches can be long - some lasting up to five days. But MLC will play a format called T-20, which is 3.5 hours long.\n\nMORE: A's say goodbye to Oakland with emotional final win at Coliseum\n\nMLC only signed a one-year deal to play in Oakland because of the current uncertainty surrounding the sale of the Coliseum. This season is expected to bring in $3 million for Oakland. Still an important revenue source for a city facing $140 million budget deficit.\n\n\"These past few years, the Coliseum and arena have done very well, to where we are getting money back. So, when we reopened the fire stations, we used money from the revenue generated here at the Coliseum and at the arena,\" explains Interim Oakland Mayor Kevin Jenkins.\n\nMLC says the Bay Area is home to the second largest cricket fan base in the United States, many of who are of South Asian descent. Fans like Omer Chaudhary and his son, who play in local leagues.\n\nChaudhary says he started playing cricket when he was four years old growing up in Pakistan. Adding it used to be hard to watch cricket living in the U.S. So, he is excited about MLC coming to the Bay Area.\n\n\"So I think now, the fact that we will have, in our backyard, we can go watch a game at the coliseum. And then, also, as a sports fan in general, some of the Bay Area teams exiting recently, and some of them not doing so well recently, too. So, I think as a general sports fan in the Bay Area, this will be good addition. Very refreshing,\" says Chaudhary, proudly wearing his Pakistan team jersey.\n\nMLC's season begins June 12. Tickets go on sale on Thursday.",

        "body": "The list of teams that are scheduled to play at the Oakland Coliseum this year just got longer.\n\nIn addition to the Oakland Roots and Soul, the storied venue will soon host the best cricket players in the country to kick off the 2025 Cognizant Major League Cricket season.\n\n“Straight off the bat, as we say in cricket. It’s very exciting,” said David White, the CEO of the San Francisco Unicorns, one of the six teams in the league. Cognizant, a technology company, is the league’s title sponsor.\n\nThe league announced Wednesday that beginning June 12, the Coliseum will host nine matches over seven days before the tournament moves to Prairie, Texas, and Broward County Stadium, in Florida, to play the remainder of the season.\n\nMajor League Cricket does not have a home-and-away stadium format. Instead, last year, teams played tournament style in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nWhite said this is an exciting opportunity to bring the sport within reach for the many fans here in the Bay Area, particularly among South Asian communities. SF Unicorns fans are called the “Sparkle Army.”\n\n“ Instead of having to wake up at 4:00 a.m. and watch it halfway around the world, they can come to a game at 7:00 p.m.and see the equivalent players play here right in the Bay Area,” White said.\n\nCricket is widely considered to be the second most popular sport in the world, after soccer. Over 100 million fans worldwide watched games last year, according to a press release from MLC.\n\nWhile the sport has a reputation for matches that can stretch on for days, White said the type of cricket played in MLC, called T20, is much more palatable for American audiences — namely because the games are much shorter. He said he hopes games at the Coliseum grow cricket’s fanbase here in the Bay Area.\n\n“It’s made for the U.S. market. It’s a two-and-a-half to three-hour version. There’s constant big hits, constant big catches and fielding with no mitts,” White continued. “ If we get it right, cricket can have a foothold here in the Bay Area and in the USA.”\n\nEstablishing the Coliseum as a venue that can successfully host cricket matches could raise the chances that the venue would be selected to host the sport for the Olympics in 2028, according to Matthew Atencio, Professor of Kinesiology at Cal State University East Bay and the co-director for the Center for Sport and Social Justice.\n\n“ There will be a need for cricket-specific venues that can host events,” Atencio said. “There aren’t many of them right now, so my view is that this would position the Bay Area as a potential venue.”\n\nCricket is set to return to the games in 2028 for only the second time in Olympic history after a 128-year hiatus.\n\nAtencio said the arrival of cricket at the Coliseum builds on the buzz generated by other teams like the Roots, who now call the stadium home. Last weekend, both the lower and upper deck of the stadium was nearly packed, as the team played in front of a crowd of more than 26,000 for the first game of their inaugural season, complete with a halftime performance by Too $hort and a post-game fireworks show.\n\n“ Now we can see the rise of grassroots soccer, we can see the rise of grassroots cricket in the Bay Area emerging as really viable professional sports opportunities for people to go to,” Atencio said.\n\nAs Oakland sports fans seek to fill the emotional void left by the departure of the Warriors, Raiders and A’s, and city officials seek to generate commerce around sporting events, teams with grassroots credentials and promises to stay “rooted” like the Oakland Ballers, Roots and Soul are offering their allegiance. Cricket is now the latest sport to offer a path forward.\n\n‘“It’s an opportunity for sports and the professional landscape to be more creative about what sports can look like,” Atencio added.\n\n“ How can we think differently in 2025 about what sports may look like in a way that is more grounded in community, grounded in different cultures — grounded in a more grassroots vision of what sports can be even at this elite level of a professional sports.”",

        "date": "Thu Mar 27 02:15:22 2025",
        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- The Oakland Coliseum announced it's set to host nine Major League Cricket matches during the 2025 season.\n\nThe opening match kicks off June 12, 2025.\n\nWhile cricket is incredibly popular around the world, American sports fans have not had many opportunities to see the sport first-hand.\n\nThe closest American comparison to cricket is baseball, but there are a lot of differences between the sports.\n\nFor those Bay Area cricket-curious fans, we decided to compare the two sports to give you a little knowledge to know before you go to your first match.\n\nHow Popular is Cricket?\n\nCricket is widely considered the world's second most popular sport, after soccer, due to its strong following in regions like South Asia, Australia, and the UK, with a global fanbase of around 2.5 billion.\n\nHow Cricket Works\n\nJust like baseball, one team bats while the other fields.\n\nWhile a baseball batting lineup is nine players, a Cricket lineup consists of 11 players.\n\nBut instead of pitching, cricket players bowl the ball, which consists of running, throwing, and bouncing the ball once before it gets to the batter.\n\nBoth baseball and cricket games consist of innings, where one team bats while the other pitches/bowls.\n\nBut where a standard baseball game is nine innings, cricket games can vary (See Formats section below).\n\nIn baseball, an inning ends when one team makes three outs either by catching a fly ball, striking a batter out, tagging a batter while they are running the bases, or throwing a ball to a base.\n\nIn cricket, an inning only ends when all eleven batters have been called out.\n\nJust like baseball, outs can be recorded by catching fly balls, but instead of tagging or throwing runners out, you smash the wicket.\n\nWhat is a wicket?\n\nA wicket is like a base in baseball, except not.\n\nA wicket consists of three sticks stuck in the ground (called stumps) connected by two other small sticks (known as bails) that sit on top of the stumps.\n\nThere are two wickets on a cricket field, one at either end of the pitch (More to come on that in the Fields section.)\n\nFielders \"take wickets,\" or record an out, by catching the ball, throwing it at or hitting a wicket with the ball, or knocking off the bails.\n\nWhen that happens, a batter is out and a new batsman hits.\n\nHow does batting work in cricket?\n\nOne big difference is that in baseball, there is only one batter on the field at a time.\n\nIn cricket, there are two batsmen on the field at the same time. One is called the striker and is the non-striker. The striker is the person actively hitting, but when a hit happens, both batsmen must run.\n\nIn American baseball, batters either get a hit, a walk or make an out. Once a baseball batter has done that, their turn is over.\n\nIn cricket, if a batter gets a hit, they get to keep batting. In fact, they don't stop batting until they are called out.\n\nIt's not uncommon for cricket batters to be hitting for 30-40 minutes at a time, whereas baseball hitters are usually only up for a matter of minutes.\n\nFun fact: the longest a cricket player has ever batted is 16 hours and 10 minutes.\n\nHow do you score in Cricket?\n\nIn baseball, batters score by crossing home plate, either because they hit a home run or another batter got a hit and drove them in.\n\nIn cricket, a run is scored after a hit is recorded and both batsmen are safely able to run to the opposite wicket, like running to a base in baseball.\n\nIf the batsmen can run to the wickets two times, they score two runs... three times... three runs, etc.\n\nCricket does have its version of a home run as well. If a batter hits the ball over the boundary line (think outfield fence, but a line on the ground) on the fly, it's six runs. If it rolls over the boundary line, it's four runs.\n\nThe team with the most runs at the end of the match wins!\n\nHow are the fields different?\n\nCricket and baseball games take place on fields, but sometimes cricket fields are called ovals.\n\nThat's because a cricket field is generally oval or circular, whereas baseball fields are often shaped like a slice of pie, with differences for each stadium.\n\nWhile a baseball field has four bases that form a diamond, with the pitcher in the middle, a cricket field has two wickets in the middle of the field, called 'the pitch' and this is where the batters and the bowler are located.\n\nDifferent Formats of Cricket\n\nThere are many formats of cricket games.\n\nThe traditional (and also longest) is a test match. Test matches are played over three to five days with as least six hours of cricket being played each day. Think of this like a baseball series, but instead of three separate games being played, it's just one game.\n\nHowever, younger audiences complained they could not spare days to watch a single game, so shorter forms of the game were developed.\n\nThese included what's known as Twenty20 (T20), 100 ball cricket, and T10 cricket matches that last a more manageable 90 minutes to three hours.\n\nIn Twenty20 (T20) cricket, each team bats for a maximum of 20 overs.\n\nAn over typically consists of six balls sent to the batsman by the bowler, but that's not always the case.\n\nIn 100-ball cricket, there are 10 overs of 10 balls each.\n\nIn T10 cricket, two teams play a single innings, which is restricted to a maximum of ten overs (60 legal balls) per side.\n\nWhen an over has been completed, a new bowler takes over (no pun intended). It's possible for players to bowl multiple times depending on the match format.\n\nSo what can you expect at the Coliseum?\n\nNine total matches will take place at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, featuring all six of the Major League Cricket's teams.\n\nThe tournaments are in the Twenty20 format, with the San Francisco Unicorns kicking off on June 12 against the Washington Freedom, in a rematch of the 2024 Championship game.\n\nTwo further home games will take place on June 14 and June 15.\n\nLegendary Australian all-rounder Shane Watson leads the Unicorns as its head coach, with the team captained by Corey Anderson.\n\nThe 2025 MLC season will be played across three venues - the Coliseum, Grand Prairie, Texas and Broward County Stadium, Florida.",
        "summary": "**Schedule:** The Oakland Coliseum will host 9 Major League Cricket matches during the 2025 season, starting on June 12, 2025.\n\n**Teams:** The tournament will feature all 6 teams of Major League Cricket, including the San Francisco Unicorns, who will play their home games at the Coliseum.\n\n**Format:** The matches will be played in the Twenty20 format, with each team batting for a maximum of 20 overs.\n\n**Key Players:** The San Francisco Unicorns will be led by head coach Shane Watson and team captain Corey Anderson.\n\n**Venues:** The 2025 MLC season will be played across three venues: the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Grand Prairie, Texas, and Broward County Stadium, Florida."

        "date": "",
        "body": "by Smit Patel • Published on\n\nThe Oakland Stadium can accommodate 56,000 spectators © Getty\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) has announced grand plans to kick off their 3rd season from the Coliseum stadium in Oakland, California from June 12. The sporting arena, located around a 20 minute drive from San Francisco, was previously home to NFL's Oakland Raiders as well as MLB's Oakland Athletics. The 56,000 seater stadium is set to host nine games between June 12 and June 19 before the 34 game MLC caravan moves to Dallas' Grand Prairie Stadium and later to the Broward County Stadium near Miami.\n\nThe Coliseum will become the second venue of its kind that MLC has secured as a home ground for one of its franchises. However unlike Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas where it required considerable capital investments to repurpose the original baseball facility to cricket, the Coliseum will not require a revamp to accommodate cricket due to its broader field dimensions. MLC confirmed adherence to ICC guidelines for boundary requirements with the smallest boundary being 56 metres.\n\nBringing cricket to a major, mainstream American stadium like the Coliseum could serve as a significant boost for the sport in the U.S., particularly in California. However, MLC has confirmed that the current agreement is only for one year. A decision on extending the arrangement into a long-term partnership will depend on how well this season demonstrates a viable proof of concept-both in terms of cricket's compatibility with the venue and whether the stadium's ownership sees cricket as a sustainable, long-term fixture.\n\n\"We have an obligation to find a home here in the Bay Area, and for the moment, that is the Coliseum. But we eventually hope that we can either take over the Coliseum or we will obviously have to look for a long term home somewhere else. We've been talking to Santa Clara fairgrounds. We've been talking to Sunnyvale. We'll be talking to a number of different locations, and we'll continue to do so across the Bay Area, until we find our home\" said David White, CEO of the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nThe MLC will undertake the ordeal of transporting two practice wickets that were installed at last year's temporary T20 World Cup venue near New York to the West Coast in California. The shipment and subsequent installation at Coliseum is expected to cost MLC over half a million USD. The overall costs of bringing cricket to the Coliseum are expected to be to the tune of USD 3 million.\n\nWhite views that additional cost as an investment to engage with more cricket fans in the Bay area. It will be the Unicorns' first shot to bring cricket to their home base and the franchise has stated its plans to employ a 'big brand' as it's community partner to facilitate events focusing on community engagement.\n\n\"We successfully hosted our family day, which is the last Sunday before our first game of the season with over 1500 fans. We intend on doing it this year too. There's one particularly big, big brand that's coming on as one of our community partners that we will be announcing next week. It's about, how do we engage, or how do we work with them to enhance the consumer and the fan experience. We'd love to have some unique San Francisco Bay Area components surrounding the overall fan experience\" added White.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet"

White disse que enquanto trabalhava com a MLC, a liga e a equipe analisaram São Francisco, San Jose, Sunwale e outros lugares de Santa Clara, mas seus pontos face estavam sempre no colágio.\n\nOperacional, o executivo -chefe da MLC, Johnny Grav, diz que a configuração atual do colágio como campo de futebol facilita a transformação quando é hora de consertar o estádio para os padrões internacionais de críquete.\n\n“A transformação do críquete no futebol será reta”, disse o túmulo. “Operacional, esse é um grande problema para nós, estádios e raízes, porque não precisamos apenas convertê -lo no campo de críquete, mas conseguimos convertê -lo de volta em um campo de futebol. É um projeto de um milhão de dólares para remover os postigos e achamos que é um investimento realmente sensível”.\n\nEmbora a primeira partida internacional de críquete tenha sido disputada em Nova York em 1844, os Estados Unidos recentemente não tinham uma rica história do jogo.\n\nNo verão passado, a seleção nacional dos EUA perturbou o Paquistão na Copa do Mundo Twenty20 e se classificou para o mesmo torneio em 2026. O nativo de Sourav Netravkar, que jogou pelo Washington em MLC, foi um jogador de destaque da Team USA na vitória contra o Paquistão. O MLC também reproduz o formato T -T -Tative, uma versão curta do jogo que pode durar vários dias em outros formatos.\n\nTanto o túmulo quanto a esperança de White, que os jogos de verão em Oakland ajudarão a aumentar o jogo antes dos Jogos Olímpicos em Los Angeles em 2028.\n\n“Estamos muito empolgados em ver a oportunidade de jogar o críquete internacional de nível superior pela primeira vez na costa oeste”, disse o túmulo. “Estamos empolgados com o que queremos dizer com críquete e torneio da Major League, mas conseguimos aumentar os jogos de Los Angeles.",

The Unicorns will host its opening game at the Oakland Coliseum against the Washington Freedom on June 12 – a rematch of the 2024 Championship game. On June 12, Shane Watson’s side will welcome West Coast rivals LA Knight Riders, before hosting MI New York on Father’s Day, June 15.\n\nThe decision to host MLC matches in Oakland has been met with enthusiasm from local officials. “The Oakland Coliseum has long been a destination for sports and entertainment, and we are excited to add cricket to its continuing legacy,” said City of Oakland Interim Mayor Kevin Jenkins. “This move underscores Oakland’s status as a diverse and dynamic sports city, and we look forward to supporting the growth of cricket in our community.”\n\nThe Oakland Coliseum has been a staple of the Bay Area’s sports landscape for decades. Previously home to Major League Baseball’s Oakland Athletics and the NFL’s Oakland Raiders, the venue has a rich history of hosting world-class sporting events and iconic concerts such as Day on the Green. With planned seating capacity for up to 12,000 fans and excellent accessibility via public transit, the Coliseum will provide an ideal setting for cricket fans to experience top-tier action up close.\n\nJohnny Grave, CEO of Major League Cricket, also expressed his excitement about the league’s new venue. “The Coliseum is a fantastic location for Major League Cricket, and we are thrilled by the prospect of some of the world’s biggest cricket stars playing in such an iconic Californian venue.”\n\n“Coming to the West Coast, and being here in Oakland, is an historic move for cricket globally. It reinforces our commitment to growing the game in the United States and providing fans with an exceptional cricket experience.”\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns co-owners Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan also commented on bringing Major League Cricket to the Bay Area: “The arrival of this sport at a world-class venue like the Oakland Coliseum, and the opportunity to have the Unicorns play in its home market, is a dream come true for us,” said Rajaraman. “We are fully committed to making the Unicorns a key part of the Bay Area’s sporting culture and providing fans with an exciting and memorable cricket experience.”\n\nHarinarayan added, “The passion for cricket in the Bay Area is undeniable, and we are thrilled to have a home that can accommodate and inspire our growing fanbase. We look forward to an incredible season ahead.”\n\nNicole Strange, General Manager, Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum and Oakland Arena (ASM Global) added: “We are proud to welcome Major League Cricket to the Coliseum in June. This will be an incredible opportunity for the Bay Area community and beyond to experience this global sport right here in the heart of Oakland.”\n\nIn its sophomore season of Major League Cricket, the San Francisco Unicorns experienced remarkable growth. The Bay Area team secured the signing of international cricket superstar Pat Cummins and boasted a roster of world-renowned stars, including Finn Allen, Matthew Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Henry, and 2019 Cricket World Cup champion Liam Plunkett. The team, led by U.S. all-rounder and standout captain Corey Anderson, reached the 2024 Championship final."

        "body": "When Johnny Grave took over as CEO of Major League Cricket (MLC) earlier this year, he stepped into one of the most ambitious sports ventures in the United States. With cricket’s global footprint, Olympic inclusion on the horizon, and surging investment in American infrastructure, the timing couldn’t be more significant.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with cricexec, just weeks into the job and on the eve of announcing the 2025 season, Grave laid out his bold plans to elevate MLC into a leading global T20 league while transforming the cricketing landscape in the US.\n\n“Taking the second biggest sport in the world into the biggest sports market in the world was just too much of an exciting opportunity to turn down,” Grave said during the interview.\n\nBuilding on momentum\n\nGrave comes into the role with deep experience, having spent over seven years as CEO of Cricket West Indies and previously holding senior commercial roles at Surrey County Cricket Club and the Professional Cricketers’ Association. While he is new to the American sports landscape, Grave said he sees MLC as a project unlike any other.\n\n“It very quickly became apparent that this was a unique opportunity,” Grave said. “The vision of the ownership group and the project is part of a billion-dollar investment in the sport in this marketplace.”\n\nThat investment is already visible. Season three of Major League Cricket will launch on June 12 and feature 34 matches across three stadiums.\n\n“Playing in permanent stadiums with lights allows us to stage games at night, which is important for fans attending after work or school,” Grave said. “We’ve also made sure the schedule doesn’t conflict with the Hundred or CPL, creating a clear window in the Northern Hemisphere summer.”\n\nFrom six to ten: A league expanding quickly\n\nGrave’s mandate includes overseeing MLC’s transition from a centrally-run league to a team-driven ecosystem, more akin to traditional US sports leagues.\n\n“We’ve moved from a founder ownership model to a co-ownership structure, with teams owning the league,” Grave said. “Now the vision is for teams to develop their own home grounds and build local fan communities.”\n\nThe current six-team league is set to expand to eight by 2027, with two additional franchises already in the pipeline, and then adding two more soon after that: “Very quickly over the next few years, we’ll become a 10 team tournament.”\n\nThis rapid growth reflects confidence in both the market potential and the structural groundwork laid by MLC and its investors.\n\nGrave emphasized the importance of creating vibrant, team-centered ecosystems. “This isn’t just about Major League Cricket,” he said. “These venues can become hubs for Minor League teams, youth programs, and grassroots development.”\n\nIt’s about building a strong, local home fan base, Grave added. That means investing in facilities, year-round engagement, and ensuring the infrastructure is there not only for match days but for sustained cricket activity throughout the year.\n\n“Teams [should] develop their own home grounds, start to build that unique environment for their fans and build that community so that we can really build out a big strong local home fan base.”\n\nA domestic pipeline with Olympic ambitions\n\nWhile international stars have attracted headlines, Grave is equally focused on the domestic talent pool and the pipeline that supports it.\n\n“We want a thriving pathway where our players can be actively involved in high-quality cricket within the US,” he said.\n\nMinor League Cricket, which features 25 teams playing across regional zones, serves as the proving ground for emerging American talent. The structure is designed to create a high-performance environment for domestic players, many of whom aspire to move up into Major League Cricket and ultimately Team USA.\n\n“If the US national team teams – both the men and women – can really build and grow, the opportunity for them to be medal prospects in LA 28 is going to create a huge halo effect for the sport in this country.”\n\nHe envisions top international teams coming to the US not just to play each other, but to play against the US national teams—raising the level of competition and visibility.\n\n“The goal is to create a clear, visible pathway for boys and girls across the country,” Grave said, “so they can see that playing for Team USA is a real, tangible opportunity.”\n\nGrave also underscored the importance of year-round cricket, whether outdoors in warmer regions or indoors during the winter months. “Kids need to know there’s a structure that will support their development and a path that leads to real professional opportunities.”\n\nGrowing the fan base: coast to coast\n\nGrave acknowledged that he’s still new to the US market, but his instincts are already guiding MLC toward a dual fan engagement strategy.\n\n“We want to attract as many fans as we possibly can,” he said. “And our message to the core cricket fans (from South Asian, Caribbean, or British backgrounds) is: bring your friends.”\n\nGrave sees community-driven fandom as the bedrock of MLC’s future. By assigning permanent home bases to teams, the league hopes to replicate the loyalty seen in other US sports.\n\n“We’ve seen it already with the Texas Super Kings,” he said. “We’re starting to build a loyal fan base in Dallas. Our aim is for every summer to feel like a can’t-miss event when Major League Cricket comes to town.”\n\nMedia partners and the power of Willow\n\nOne of the advantages MLC enjoys is the backing of Willow, the go-to cricket broadcaster in the US Grave was effusive in his praise for Willow and its role in building cricket’s media footprint across America.\n\nIf you’re already a cricket fan in the US, Willow is your home, according to Grave.\n\n“We are blessed with a really fantastic local broadcaster in the United States with the Willow Group who get behind cricket so much.”\n\nGrave is in awe at the amount of cricket Willow makes available: “if you are already a cricket fan you can go to Willow and watch an unbelievable amount of cricket live in the US – probably more than you can in any other part of the world.”\n\nThat level of access makes it easier to convert casual fans into loyal followers—and to ensure that MLC matches are front and center throughout the season.\n\nCommercial traction and long-term ambition\n\nGrave brings a strong commercial background to the role and sees both sponsorship and media rights as key growth drivers for the league.\n\n“The cost of developing and maintaining cricket stadiums is significant,” he said. “But it shows the seriousness and intent of our investment group.”\n\nHe pointed to the growing family of MLC sponsors, led by title partner Cognizant, as a sign of momentum.\n\n“We’re blessed with Cognizant as a fantastic league partner,” he said. “And we’re seeing sponsors who don’t just want to attach their name—they want to activate, grow with the league, and engage their customer base.”\n\nGrave is optimistic about the broader sponsorship landscape in the US, calling it “the most sophisticated sports market in the world when it comes to the commercial side.”\n\n“I think the strength of the sponsorship market generally and the culture of brands who use sports to add to their marketing mix is so strong… there’s just an innate knowledge amongst brand marketers and marketing directors and CEOs that sport can be a fantastic platform for their business.”\n\nMLC’s ambition is clear: to become one of the most commercially successful cricket leagues globally.\n\n“Outside of the IPL, I think we can become the number two (cricket) league in the world when it comes to direct sponsorship revenue,” Grave said.\n\nThat’s a massive goal—but Grave believes it is achievable.\n\nA new chapter begins\n\nIn many ways, Grave’s arrival signals a new era for cricket in America—one defined by infrastructure, fan-building, and long-term ambition.\n\nThe upcoming season is shaping up to be MLC’s most ambitious yet, with matches on both coasts and more opportunities for fans to engage.\n\n“The best cricketers in the world are coming to town,” Grave said. “And they’re playing under lights, in proper stadiums, in a compact, high-energy tournament.”\n\nGrave is entering this new role eyes-wide-open about the challenges ahead: “It’s going to be a big learning curve for me,” he admitted. “But it’s a great opportunity. And I genuinely believe this league can change the future of the sport in this country.”\n\nWith a clear vision, committed ownership, and growing momentum, Major League Cricket under Johnny Grave is aiming not just to grow, but to thrive—and redefine what’s possible for cricket in the world’s biggest sports market.",
