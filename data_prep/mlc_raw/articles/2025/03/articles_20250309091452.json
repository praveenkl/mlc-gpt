        "body": "cricket\n\nView(s):\n\nFifteen long years after their last major domestic triumph, Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club has roared back into the limelight, clinching the Major League Cricket title in emphatic fashion. While the mighty Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) suffered the humiliation of relegation to Tier ‘B’—a historic fall from grace—Bloomfield’s warriors from Reid Avenue made a compelling statement, reclaiming their status as a force to be reckoned with once again.\n\nA first-innings victory over Nondescripts Cricket Club (NCC) proved decisive, sealing Bloomfield’s first major silverware since their Premier League triumph in the 2010-11 season. It’s a victory that not only etches their name back in domestic cricket’s elite but also injects the club with a much-needed shot of confidence and ambition as they plot further conquests.\n\nThe echoes of their past glories resonate strongly—after all, it was under Chinthaka Jayasinghe’s captaincy, with Tharanga Dhammika as coach, that Bloomfield last tasted championship success. Now, Dhammika, returning as head coach, has orchestrated yet another fairytale finish, this time under the astute leadership of Nipun Karunanayake.\n\nUnlike the heavyweight clubs such as SSC, NCC, Colts, or CCC—sides brimming with international stars—Bloomfield’s campaign was driven by sheer grit, unwavering determination, and an unyielding belief in their abilities. Their monumental total of 508 runs in the first innings was built on the back of a sensational double century from former Trinity College batsman Ron Chandragupta (237). He was ably supported by crucial knocks from Hasitha Boyagoda (52), Asitha Wanninayake (96), and Lahiru Madushanka (50), ensuring that Bloomfield had both the runs and the momentum to dictate terms.\n\nNCC, refusing to go down without a fight, showed early resolve in their reply, but despite a magnificent 142 from opener Lahiru Udara, they could only muster 312. Bloomfield’s bowling unit, relentless in their pursuit of victory, ensured that a first-innings lead of 196 runs was more than enough to put them in the driver’s seat.\n\nOpting not to enforce the follow-on, Bloomfield made their intentions clear—batting through the day to take the match to a tame draw while ensuring the title was safely in their grasp. Their batters took the opportunity to chase personal milestones, with Asitha Wanninayake—who had agonisingly missed a century in the first innings by just four runs—making amends with a well-crafted ton. Skipper Karunanayake added his 40th half-century, solidifying his role as the team’s anchor.\n\nThe 21-year-old Wanninayake shared an unbeaten 148-run partnership for the fifth wicket with his captain, frustrating NCC’s bowlers who toiled hard without much success. When Bloomfield finally declared with a lead of 428 runs and just 13 overs left in the game, Wanninayake had smashed 104, featuring 12 boundaries, while Karunanayake remained unbeaten on 75, peppering his innings with six boundaries and two sixes. As the final stumps were drawn, Bloomfield’s players erupted in celebration, their return to the pinnacle of domestic cricket complete."
