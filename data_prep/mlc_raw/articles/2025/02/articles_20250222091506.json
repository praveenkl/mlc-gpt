        "title": "How CEOs of Microsoft, Google, Palo Alto bought an English cricket team",
        "date": "Sat Feb 15 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "Late last year, Nikesh Arora, billionaire CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, was hanging out in his California home with his friend, vice chairman of Indian tech conglomerate Times Internet, Satyan Gajwani, when the pair got to talking about cricket.\n\nGajwani is a co-founder of Major League Cricket, a U.S. league that launched in 2023. Arora has a stake in one of its teams. They were discussing ways to grow the business when Gajwani mentioned another upstart tournament, which had just begun looking for capital on the other side of the Atlantic. They called some more friends: Satya Nadella, Microsoft Inc.’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, the head of Google parent Alphabet Inc., and Shantanu Narayen, who runs Adobe Inc.\n\nLess than three months later, the five giants of the tech world are part of a consortium that has stumped up £147 million ($182 million) for a 49 per cent share of London Spirit, a four-year-old franchise in The Hundred, a startup league in England and Wales. The league’s organizers hope to revive the fortunes of a sport whose popularity has dwindled, and reinvent it for the social media era. The Hundred has collectively raised more than £520 million from investors hoping to emulate the success of the big-money Indian Premier League (IPL), a $30 billion global brand.\n\n“The value of well-run sports franchises has been on a tear, whether it’s the NBA, NFL, Formula One. There’s now a women’s NBA league that’s also done well,” Arora said in an interview. “If you can organize it right and set the frameworks right and make it engaging and enjoyable to the fans, there’s an opportunity economically.”\n\nEnglish cricket is sometimes viewed as a stuffy sport that clings to tradition. Until 1999, Queen Elizabeth II was the only woman allowed into the pavilion at Lord’s cricket ground during play. Even now, men must still wear a tie or cravat to get in. The traditional domestic competition, played between county teams with games that can last four days and still end in a tie, has been in decline for years. Most games are no longer broadcast on live television, and are simply streamed online by the counties for free — although international matches, which can last up to five days, still attract strong audiences and high ticket prices.\n\nTo keep the sport alive, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), its governing body, has experimented with shorter-form versions, the most successful of which has been T20, where each team faces 20 overs — that is, 120 pitches of the ball. The format incentivizes more aggressive play and is usually over in less than four hours. Add to that a “more glamorous entertainment sell,” and you have a sport more likely to appeal to a younger demographic, says Dan Plumley, a sports finance lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University.\n\nThe IPL, which launched in 2008, has honed the format to great effect, amping up the spectacle with cheerleaders, bursts of flames and blasting music. The league has become a behemoth in the sport, attracting its best players and billions of dollars in advertising and TV and streaming rights.\n\nThe ECB launched its own T20 league, The Blast, in 2003, but it struggled for traction. In 2021, the ECB tried again with The Hundred, an even shorter format. Each side faces 100 balls per game. Women’s and men’s teams play on the same day, broadcasters explain the basics of the game to newcomers in simple terms and there’s live music between matches.\n\nEarly indications were strong. The ECB signed broadcast deals with Sky Sports and the BBC, as well as a multimillion pound sponsorship agreement with food producer KP Snacks.\n\nThe Hundred soon began to attract attention from private equity investors, but the ECB’s need to retain governance rights over the league prevented a deal from being struck, according to Vikram Banerjee, the organization’s director of business operations. Rivals took note too. Last year, IPL founder Lalit Modi offered the ECB $1 billion to host an alternative competition to The Hundred, essentially asking the board to give up on their project.\n\nModi’s approach, which the ECB rebuffed, spurred the organization to hire the investment bank Raine Group and consultants from Deloitte to figure out ways to cash in on the format. Their solution was to hand each of the eight venues that host the teams a 51 per cent stake in their local franchise and put the remaining 49 per cent up for sale.\n\nThe ECB’s promotional material talked up a “rare opportunity to invest in the birthplace of cricket.” The reality is perhaps more prosaic. The team names and kits, invented for the new league, can be changed, and investors wouldn’t be buying a county club — most of which are still owned by their members — simply a team that uses the ground for a few weeks per year.\n\nBut when the first round of bidding opened in September, more than 100 investors, including private equity companies, US sports investment groups and IPL franchise owners expressed an interest in buying a stake, the ECB said. That was whittled down to 35 potential investors, from which host venues chose a shortlist. The remaining suitors then bid for one or more franchise in live auctions, with bids rising every 15 minutes in increments of at least £3 million.\n\nThe first franchise to sell, on Jan. 30, was Oval Invincibles, one of the two London clubs on offer. India’s billionaire Ambani family, which also owns the Mumbai Indians IPL team, bought a 49 per cent stake, valuing it at just over £120 million. Later that day, Knighthead Capital, a fund backed by NFL legend Tom Brady, bought a stake in Birmingham Phoenix at a £80 million valuation.\n\nBut it was the London Spirit auction the following day that really set the process alight. The franchise plays its home matches at Lord’s, often referred to as the “home of cricket.” Bidding went on for hours, pitting Arora’s group against rivals that included Todd Boehly, co-owner of Chelsea FC soccer club, the LA Lakers basketball team and the LA Dodgers baseball franchise.\n\nArora’s consortium by now included Johann Rupert, the billionaire controlling shareholder of Cartier owner Richemont, as well as Jim Goetz, a partner at Sequoia, and Egon Durban of Silver Lake Capital, a backer of UFC, Manchester City football club and the New Zealand rugby team. They stuck with it as the price rose far above its early estimates. It was “hard for all of us collectively to let go,” Arora said.\n\nThe eventual price for their stake valued London Spirit at £295 million. Over the next two weeks, several IPL owners, including Sanjiv Goenka’s RPSG conglomerate, the industrial multinational Sun Group, and the infrastructure company GMR Group, snapped up stakes. Boehly, through the Cain International vehicle that he set up with British businessman Jonathan Goldstein, paid just under £40 million for a stake in Nottingham’s Trent Rockets. The auctions put a combined valuation of £975 million on the franchises, although the winners are now in exclusive talks with their potential partners, meaning it’s not a done deal yet. The bidders could still try to lower the price, or deals could fall apart.\n\nThe ECB plans on investing the proceeds into the county game, and into grassroots cricket. Some observers are skeptical that the injection of capital will be enough to reverse the decline. “There is no guarantee that simply bringing in investment is going to solve all ills,” Trevor Watkins, head of sports at law firm Pinsent Mason, said. “Indeed, it may only potentially act as a sticking plaster on issues that exist.”\n\nAs for The Hundred, the ECB said it expects the tournament’s revenue to reach £145 million in 2030, three times its current level. More than half of that is forecast to come from domestic TV rights.\n\nThe league’s long-term prospects may depend on whether it can build an audience beyond England and Wales. The fastest way to achieve that would be to attract the sport’s top players, most of whom play in the IPL. The ECB’s Banerjee said that the league isn’t depending on bringing Indian talent across. The organization has arranged The Hundred’s schedule so it doesn’t overlap with the IPL, but it will still need to convince Indian cricket’s governing body to release its male players, who are currently restricted from playing overseas.\n\n“We know part of this is about opening up the broadcast market overseas and India is a big part of that,” Plumley said. “It’s absolutely valid for the ECB to say they can do well without them, but also the other side of the argument is it’s probably better with them.”\n\nArora said that it will be five to 10 years before it’s clear whether he and his consortium got a good deal on London Spirit.\n\n“If this is successful and we can get it to rival the success of the IPL and build something amazing for the English cricket fanbase and perhaps a global cricket fanbase, then we paid a very good price,” he said. “If it doesn’t succeed collectively, then we possibly paid more than we should have.”\n\nBut, he said, he and his colleagues have brought more than just money to the game. “Sundar has one of the largest streaming properties as part of YouTube; Shantanu runs one of the world’s biggest creative technology platforms in Adobe; Egon owns $80 billion of sport franchises. We have so many different capabilities that can be brought to bear.”\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "date": "Fri Feb 21 08:53:15 2025",
        "body": "MI New York Snags Agni Chopra as Top Draft Pick\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Major League Cricket (MLC) domestic players draft saw Agni Chopra, son of renowned Bollywood director and producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, being selected as the number 1 draft pick by MI New York for a whopping $50,000. The 26-year-old opening batter has quickly risen to fame in the cricketing world, garnering attention with his exceptional performance in the Ranji Trophy season.\n\nFrom India to the USA: Agni Chopra’s Journey\n\nChopra’s stellar record of 4 centuries in 4 games during the 2023-24 Ranji season caught the eye of many, solidifying his position as a talented player. His success continued as he joined Mizoram in the 2024-25 season, where he impressively scored a total of 1804 runs with an average of 94.94, reminiscent of the legendary Sir Don Bradman.\n\nWhat sets Chopra apart is his unique qualification as a domestic player, which stems from his USA citizenship acquired through birth in Detroit, Michigan. This distinction allowed him to make a strategic move towards the USA cricket scene after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) implemented a policy preventing foreign passport holders from participating in the Ranji Trophy.\n\nRising Stars and Surprising Twists in the Draft\n\nWhile Chopra’s selection made headlines, another standout player in the draft was Jasdeep Singh, a 32-year-old fast bowler from the USA. Despite facing setbacks in previous drafts, Singh emerged as the top pick this year after signing a lucrative deal with the Seattle Orcas for $75,000, marking a significant milestone in his cricketing journey.\n\nAdditionally, the Texas Super Kings made a bold move by securing fast bowling all-rounder Shubham Ranjane for $75,000, showcasing their commitment to building a strong lineup. Other notable picks included young left-arm seamer Stephen Wiig, who was recognized for his consistent performances in the Minor League Cricket over the past few years.\n\nFranchise Strategies and Player Retentions\n\nAs the draft unfolded, franchises like MI New York, Los Angeles Knight Riders, and Washington Freedom strategically made their picks to strengthen their squads. MI New York focused on bolstering their batting lineup with the signings of Tajinder Singh Dhillon, Sharad Lumba, and Kunwarjit Singh, while the Orcas, Knight Riders, and Freedom opted for a mix of experience and emerging talent to enhance their rosters.\n\nNotable mentions of players who received rookie contracts included wicketkeeper-batter Rahul Jariwala, leg spinner Adam Khan, and left-arm seamer Abhishek Paradkar, highlighting the diverse pool of talent present in the MLC draft. However, the draft also saw surprises with the likes of former international players Shehan Jayasuriya and John Campbell going undrafted, showcasing the competitive nature of the selection process.\n\nOverall, the MLC domestic players draft was a testament to the growing popularity and competitiveness of cricket in the USA, with promising talents like Agni Chopra and Jasdeep Singh shaping the future of the sport in the country.\n\nChopra’s Impact on MI New York\n\nWith Agni Chopra joining MI New York as their top draft pick, the team has gained a valuable asset in the form of a talented opening batter. His ability to score consistently and perform under pressure makes him a crucial player for MI New York’s batting lineup. Chopra’s experience in domestic cricket in India, coupled with his unique background as a USA citizen, brings a diverse skill set to the team.\n\nMI New York’s decision to invest in Chopra reflects their strategic approach to building a competitive squad for the upcoming season. By securing a player of Chopra’s caliber, the team aims to strengthen their chances of success in the league and attract a broader fan base, especially with the allure of having a player with ties to the Bollywood industry.\n\nEmerging Talent in the MLC Draft\n\nThe MLC draft not only showcased established players like Agni Chopra and Jasdeep Singh but also highlighted the emergence of young talent in the cricketing scene. Players like Stephen Wiig, who have proven their mettle in the Minor League Cricket, demonstrate the depth of talent available in the USA. Their inclusion in the draft opens up opportunities for them to make their mark on the professional cricketing stage.\n\nFranchises like the Texas Super Kings taking a chance on players like Shubham Ranjane indicate a shift towards investing in potential rather than just experience. This approach not only nurtures new talent but also adds excitement and unpredictability to the league as young players strive to prove themselves on the big stage.\n\nStrategies for Success in the MLC\n\nAs teams like MI New York, Los Angeles Knight Riders, and Washington Freedom strategize their player selections, they focus on creating a well-rounded squad that can compete at the highest level. Balancing experience with youth, batting prowess with bowling depth, and leadership with emerging talent are key considerations for these franchises as they aim for success in the MLC.\n\nPlayer retentions also play a crucial role in maintaining team dynamics and continuity. Franchises that retain key players from previous seasons often benefit from established partnerships and understanding on the field, which can be instrumental in achieving consistent performance and results in the league.\n\nThe Future of Cricket in the USA\n\nWith the influx of talent and the growing popularity of cricket in the USA, the future of the sport looks promising. The MLC serves as a platform for both local and international players to showcase their skills, paving the way for a more competitive and diverse cricketing landscape in the country. As more players like Agni Chopra and Jasdeep Singh make their mark on the league, cricket enthusiasts can look forward to exciting matches and new stars emerging on the horizon.\n\nOverall, the MLC draft represents a significant step forward in elevating cricket’s status in the USA and expanding its reach to a broader audience. With talented players, strategic team selections, and a growing fan base, the league is poised for continued growth and success in the years to come.",
