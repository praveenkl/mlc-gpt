        "body": "Cricket this decade finally expanded into the U.S. to fulfil long-time ambitions.\n\nLast year’s T20 World Cup was partially played there with many games held at a $30 million temporary stadium in New York, while cricket will end a 128-year Olympic drought at the Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nMajor League Cricket, a well-heeled T20 franchise league luring many of the world’s best players, will start its third season this year and has plans to soon expand from six to eight teams.\n\nFrom a strategic point of view, the U.S. has for some time been the growth country for cricket and seen as the sport’s sleeping giant. While the development there has been encouraging and its future increasingly promising, China has fallen off the map after once being ranked alongside the U.S. as a target market.\n\nForbesAs Focus Intensifies On Rising U.S., Cricket In China Remains A Work In Progress\n\n\"From a strategic point of view, U.S. and China were the two target markets. U.S. was No. 1, and China was No. 2,\" Tim Anderson, the ICC’s head of global development from 2010 to 2016, once told me.\n\n\"We needed to demonstrate return on investment. Having more competitive teams on the stage - which we’re seeing now - but equally it was about how the emerging cricket market could impact the economics globally of the sport.\"\n\nChinese cricket, however, has not grown as hoped with their women’s team ranked 48th in the T20I rankings, while the men’s sit 88th. Observers close to the scene have feared that the sport’s administrators have lost interest in its pet project in a country noted for bureaucratic hurdles. Mysteriously, the Chinese Cricket Association, which has been a member of the ICC since 2004, doesn’t even have a website.\n\nBut in a much-needed tonic, Cricket New South Wales and Sydney Cricket Club have partnered up with the Chinese Cricket Association in a five-year deal, where Chinese players, coaches and administrators will receive expertise in T20 high performance.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the Chinese men’s and women’s national teams lived and trained in Sydney in recent months, utilising some of Cricket NSW’s facilities.\n\n\"The Chinese Cricket Association is proud to be in partnership with Cricket NSW and the Sydney Cricket Club to accelerate the development of cricket in China from the grass roots to the elite level,\" a Chinese Cricket Association spokesperson said.\n\n\"Our national teams have benefitted greatly from the time spent in Sydney these past few months, and we look forward to exploring opportunities for further development with CNSW and SCC in the future.\"\n\nThere will be further training and competitive opportunities under the deal, with the hope for China to one day qualify for the Olympics.\n\n\"We have been delighted to be able to work with Sydney Cricket Club in building this relationship with the Chinese Cricket Association and over the last few months, the Chinese men’s and women’s national teams,\" Cricket NSW chief Lee Germon said.\n\n\"We are looking forward to continuing to grow this partnership and helping China qualify for the Olympic Games.\"\n\nCricket was played at the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou at the University of Technology Pingfeng field, which was once a park adorned with sunflower plants. China didn’t field any teams at the event after their women finished fourth at the 2010 and 2014 editions. Cricket’s future in the Asian Games is uncertain.\n\nBut China being able to one day qualify for the Olympics would be a game-changer for the sport, just like it has opened up so many possibilities in the U.S.\n\n\"If cricket got into the Olympics that would change the dynamics for the sport in China,\" Anderson previously told me. \"China qualifying for a World Cup or cricket being part of the Olympics would be a thing.\"",

        "body": "Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO\n\nThe Microsoft CEO was part of a consortium of 11 tech executives who agreed to a reported £145 million (roughly $180 million) deal for a 49% stake in The Hundred's London Spirit team.\n\nIt's not the first time Nadella has put money into the sport. He was among the lead investors in the US's Major League Cricket and co-owns the league's Seattle Orcas team.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup, Nadella told Bloomberg that cricket was a \"big deal\" for him.\n\n\"I love the sport, and I'm glad that it's now being played even in the United States,\" he said.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google CEO\n\nPichai was another member of the elite consortium that made headlines with its investment in the Spirit.\n\nThe Google exec is also a long-time fan of the sport and has said he dreamed of being a cricketer when he was growing up. In an interview with the BBC in 2021, he put his skills to the test and took up both bat and ball against the outlet's Amol Rajan on the Google campus.\n\nShantanu Narayen, Adobe CEO\n\nLike Nadella, Narayen was a member of the tech consortium and also previously invested in Major League Cricket. He is part of the MLC's San Francisco Unicorn team, which is owned by Rocketship.vc partners Venky Harinarayan and Anand Rajaraman.\n\nSpeaking with CNBC-TV18 in June, Narayen said he was continuing to try to build the sport in the US.\n\n\"The question is how do you encourage that farm system?\" he said. \"Whether it's Satya or me, we love cricket, and we'll continue to champion it.\"\n\nNikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks\n\nArora led the group that purchased the Spirit.\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn following the deal, the CEO said he was excited to partner with Lord's — known as \"The Home of Cricket\" — and his fellow techies to support The Hundred.\n\n\"A strong passion for sports brings us all together, Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world. Time to put the hundreds on the map,\" he wrote.\n\nIn an interview with The Times of London, Arora called it a \"one-of-a-kind asset.\"\n\n\"We might have paid higher than we thought but we were keen to get the asset and I talked to many of my passionate consortium members and we all figured we'd keep stretching until it became uncomfortable,\" he added.\n\nThe consortium also includes Indian media tycoon Satyan Gajwani and Sequoia's Jim Goetz, per Arora.\n\nIndia's billionaire Ambani family\n\nMukesh Ambani, the chairman of the multinational conglomerate Reliance Industries, is India's richest person, with a net worth of nearly $90 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nHis company reportedly purchased a 49% stake in the Oval Invincibles team worth £60 million (around $74 million).\n\nReliance Industries also owns the Indian Premier League's Mumbai Indians, one of the league's most successful franchises.\n\nThe Ambani's cricket empire also includes the MLC's MI New York team, which won the first edition of the competition.\n\nEgon Durban, co-CEO of Silver Lake Partners\n\nDurban, co-CEO of the tech-focused private equity firm Silver Lake, was also part of Arora's tech consortium.\n\nIt's not Silver Lake's first foray into sports. In 2022, the company invested NZ$200 million (around $113 million as of today) in New Zealand Rugby Commercial, an entity that manages the commercial aspects of the All Blacks. Silver Lake increased its stake in NZR Commercial from 5.71% to 7.5% in 2023.\n\nNFL legend Tom Brady\n\nOutside tech execs and billionaires, Tom Brady-backed investment firm Knighthead Capital Management was announced this week as the preferred private investor for a minority stake in another Hundred team, the Birmingham Phoenix.\n\nSubject to the deal's completion, Knighthead will acquire a 49% stake in the team, at a reported value of £40 million (almost $50 million).\n\nThe former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback entered into a partnership with the company in 2023 to become a minority owner of Birmingham City Football Club.",

        "title": "Nosthush Kenjige Interview: MLC Gave Us Confidence To Do Well In T20 World Cup",
        "date": "Mon Feb 10 04:09:18 2025",
        "body": "Over the last 4-5 years, associate cricket has been at its very best. Majorly because countries like Canada [Global T20], the USA [Major League Cricket] and the UAE [ILT20] have churned out T20 leagues, giving their local talents the much-needed opportunity to rub shoulders with some of the best in the business.\n\nThe International League T20 (ILT20) is one of those tournaments that has seen not only players from the UAE get the exposure they deserve but also paved the way for associate cricketers to compete at a high level.\n\nNosthush Kenjige, a USA spinner, is one such player who has benefitted from it. He may not have played a game in the ILT20 yet, but he has been part of the Mumbai Indians (MI) dressing room around the world, including winning MLC with them (MI New York) in 2023.\n\n\"I think from, from the associate player's point of view, I think it's a great initiative that the ILT20 has taken,\" Kenjige said in a chat with Cricket.com.\n\n\"To have two associate players in the team, it means that you can share the dressing room and see what the routines and how the, the bigger guys, the ones who have done really well in world cricket, go about doing their preparation in terms of the tactically or even in terms of technically. It's just a pleasure to be here.\"\n\nBe it at the MI Emirates or New York, Kenjige has rubbed shoulders with some giants of the game, including Nicholas Pooran, his captain, Kieron Pollard, and Akeal Hosein, among others. He believes that such stars are humble and are easy to approach in terms of getting valuable tips.\n\n“With the big players, I think one thing that stands out is they're really confident in their abilities, and off the field, they're very humble, they're very approachable,\" he said.\n\n\"So if you want to learn something, this is the best place to be, any questions that you have. I've had a journey that's lasted for more than 7 to 8 years; they've spent so much time in the arena, so it's just easy to go and shoot your questions because they've been in the war. Somebody like me who's younger in terms of cricket experience, whatever questions I have, it's just easy for me to shoot to them, and they're very approachable and help me through it.\"\n\nAs part of the MI family, there is a certain familiarity factor when it comes to having almost the same teammates in both setups, which has certainly helped Kenjige find his own feet.\n\n\"Since there's a crisscross between the players coming from New York to Emirates, I think it helps in the sense that I know them well because we've played there together,\" he reckons.\n\n“And since Pooran was my captain there, it helps that I have a familiar face who is leading the team here as well. It's, it's a good relationship to have with these guys. Even Pollard is here, and it's kind of, you see them here and you go back there as well, and you know that. If you're working on your game, then it's visible when you come here,” he added.\n\n“Once you finish this tournament, there's a continuity and it gives you a kind of validation as to if you're working on your game and if you're improving from your game. So, it's a very good feeling for me to play with the same guys, and I really appreciate what MI has done for me.”\n\nEvery cricketer dreams of playing in the T20 World Cup, but very few get the opportunity to do so. Kenjige is one of the lucky ones who not only played in it but also made an instant impact.\n\nOn his T20 World Cup debut, he took wickets of Usman Khan, Shadab Khan, and Azam Khan, playing a huge role in restricting Pakistan to under 160. It turned out to be one of the best games of the tournament, as the USA went on to win the game in the Super Over.\n\nKenjige believes that MLC played a huge role in the USA, putting up an excellent show in the World Cup. \"I think the World Cup was a big game-changer for cricket in the USA. I think it just brought all the eyeballs into the USA cricket,\" the 33-year-old spinner said.\n\n\"I think we were quietly very confident of doing well against the bigger sides. One of the reasons was the Major League. We played two years of Major League before the World Cup, and in the major leagues, we played among the best in the world.\n\nAlso Read: Nosthush Kenjige - the spinner from Chikkamagaluru who plagued Pakistan\n\n\"That kind of gives you that confidence that you can do well against the same players who are in the World Cup. So once you have rubbed shoulders with Pollard, Pooran, Tim David, and Trent Boult, you learn from them, and then all of a sudden, you're representing your country in the biggest stage.\n\n\"You can just carry your learnings and experience, and it helps in those big moments. I think that is one of the main reasons we did well in the World Cup, and we also made sure that we qualified for the 2026 World Cup. So, hopefully, we do well there as well.\"\n\nHowever, Kenjige often finds himself in competition with Harmeet Singh, who is a left-arm spinner too but is a better batter. As a result, when it comes to picking just one of the two, it is Harmeet who gets the nod.\n\nKenjige admits that he has been working on his batting to be more valuable to the team.\n\n\"I think one thing for me personally is there's always the pursuit of being the best version of myself. So, I don't think I'm anywhere close to it. And in terms of my game, in the overall sense, I think I want to improve in all aspects where I can give value to the team,\" Kenjige said.\n\n\"So batting is one region where I'm working as well. I've been working here with Robin [Singh, MI Emirates coach] sir, and we have so many coaches who have so much knowledge. So it just becomes easier to just bat and gain insight from their knowledge.\n\n\"On the bowling front, it's been a journey where I'm trying to explore what kind of variations, what kind of angles, what kind of speeds I can be bowling at on different surfaces and trying to learn from Akeal [Hosein] as to what his mental clarity and picture he goes through bowling in different situations of the game as well.\n\n\"So it's a process which will be never ending because if you stop learning, then there's no point playing the game because you want to learn every day. So, just working on those areas, and let's see how we go.\"\n\nWith a year and a half or so to go before the T20 World Cup, Kenjige will hope that the ILT20 and MLC will continue to help him improve and take him and US cricket to greater heights (yet again).",
        "summary": "* Nosthush Kenjige, a USA spinner, has benefited from playing in the MLC, which has given him the opportunity to rub shoulders with top cricketers and learn from them.\n* Kenjige won the MLC with Mumbai Indians (MI) New York in 2023 and has been part of the MI franchise in different leagues, including the ILT20.\n* The MLC has provided a platform for associate players like Kenjige to gain exposure and compete at a high level.\n* Kenjige believes that playing in the MLC helped him and the USA team prepare for the T20 World Cup, where they put up a good show.\n* The experience of playing against top players in the MLC gave Kenjige confidence to perform well in the World Cup.\n* Kenjige credits the MLC for helping him learn from top players and improve his game, which ultimately helped him make an impact in the World Cup."

This includes five IPL championships, two Champions League victories, and the inaugural WPL and Major League Cricket titles in 2023, along with the ILT20 title in 2024.\n\nBy CNBCTV18\n\nPace spearhead Kagiso Rabada produced an inspired bowling performance to lead MI Cape Town to their maiden SA20 title with a comfortable 76 runs win over two-time champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape in the final at the Wanderers. After finishing last in the previous two seasons, the Rashid Khan-led MI Cape Town hardly put any foot wrong in the third season.\n\nRabada on Saturday night claimed 4/25 in 3.4 overs to dismiss Sunrisers Eastern Cape for just 105 in response to MI Cape Town's 181 for 8 -- the second-highest score in a SA20 final. Rabada was ably supported by player-of-the-match Trent Boult, who took two wickets for just nine runs from his four overs, spin twins George Linde (2/20) and skipper Rashid (1/19).\n\nWith this triumph, Mumbai. New York. Emirates. Cape Town. Every team in the MI Family now has a Winner’s trophy in its cabinet. Nita Ambani said, “What a proud and historic moment for the MI family! From Mumbai to New York, the UAE to Cape Town - MI teams have won league titles & the hearts of fans across the globe. This title is a testament to our commitment to excellence, our belief in talent, and the spirit of Mumbai Indians. We are a truly global family, united by our passion for the game. A heartfelt thank you to all our fans for their unwavering support - this victory is as much yours as it is ours. Congratulations to MI Cape Town for making 2025 a year to remember!”\n\nChasing 182, the Aiden Markram-led Sunrisers, which had registered consecutive wins over Joburg Super Kings and Paarl Royals in the last two matches, could not maintain the momentum and except Tom Abell and Tony de Zorzi, no other batter could live upto the expectations.\n\nLeg-spinner Rashid, who had surprised the cricket world by leading Afghanistan to the semifinals of the T20 World Cup last year, has added another feather in his already illustrious career. Earlier, in the same tournament, he became the highest wicket-taker in the T20 format.\n\nAkash Ambani said, “MI Cape Town’s journey this season has been nothing short of exceptional, and I couldn’t be prouder of the team. This victory is a testament to the MI philosophy—backing talent, believing in the process, and playing with heart. This win is for\n\nour fans, who have stood by us through every high and low. Newlands Cape Town, this is your moment—enjoy it!\"\n\nHigh on confidence after five wins on the trot before the final, MI Cape Town won the toss and chose to bat. In-form Ryan Rickelton (33 off 15; 1x4, 4x6s) and Rassie van der Dussen (23 off 25; 2x6s) showed their intent from the onset, giving an aggressive start to MI Cape Town's innings.\n\nCraig Overton bowled an economical first over in which only three runs came but in the second over Rickelton smashed sixes over deep third man and fine-leg besides a straight four over Marco Jansen's head. Overton too was not spared as Van der Dussen hit a six over square leg while Rickelton continued his attacking game against Jansen by hitting two brilliant sixes in the fourth over.\n\nBut MI Cape Town suffered consecutive blows which gave Sunrisers a chance to make a comeback in the game. Rickelton was the first to depart, deceived by a slower ball from Overton and Liam Gleeson took a fine catch. In the very next over, Liam Dawson dismissed Reeza Hendricks, who failed to open his account.\n\nOver the past 17 years, the franchise has 11 T20 league titles worldwide. This includes five IPL championships, two Champions League victories, and the inaugural WPL and Major League Cricket titles in 2023, along with the ILT20\n\ntitle in 2024.\n\nMI’s journey has been one of passion, perseverance, and excellence, bringing together talent from across the world and winning not just trophies, but the hearts of millions of fans.

Great to have such a bowling line-up - KG Rabada, Corbin Bosch, Trent Boult and George Linde. It gives me the advantage. It's great to be part of this bowling group.\"\n\n\"It's amazing to be back for MI Cape Town. I missed last season with a back injury, and when I got a call before the season, I was asked if I wanted to lead the team, and I said yes, absolutely.

Now, we have the SA20.\"\n\nRobin Peterson (MICT Head Coach):\n\n\"I think the biggest thing was that we jelled as a team. The guys enjoyed each others company on and off the field. They have made a lot of friendships in the dressing room which will last for a long time. It was great campaign for everybody. Rashid led the side really well and many of us will not forget this day at all.\"\n\n\"I think it's pretty easy. All of those cricketers have their own standards. I am just really proud of my team as I walk out to receive the Spirit of Cricket Award on behalf of the entire team. I think the team environment was the standout thing for me.
