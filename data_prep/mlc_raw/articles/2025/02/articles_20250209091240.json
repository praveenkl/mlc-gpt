        "body": "JOHANNESBURG: The one truism in T20 cricket? Mumbai Indians and their sister concerns around the world just win. The New York side won the inaugural Major League Cricket. The Emirates outfit, part of the International League T20, won in 2024. Mumbai Indians, the OG, wrote the grammar on how to be a successful, trophy-laden franchise. MI Cape Town? For the first two years of the side's existence, they were in danger of being classed as the runt of the litter. In 2023, in the SA20's inaugural edition, and 2024, they finished bottom.\n\nHello. This wasn't normal.\n\nNormalcy was restored in 2025 as MI Cape Town, in front of owner Akash Ambani, won the third edition of the SA20. In front of a packed crowd at the Wanderers Stadium, the Rashid Khan-led side beat Sunrisers Eastern Cape, back-to-back defending champions, by 76 runs. As soon as they won, fireworks erupted across the night sky to signal a first-time winner at a heaving stadium, with some fans coming in a good 150 minutes before the start of the final.\n\nOpting to bat first on a surface with runs in it, they made 181 in their quota of 20 overs. Even if several of their star players had cameos to their name — both Dewald Brevis and Ryan Rickelton made attractive 30s apart from hitting more sixes than fours (15 compared to seven, it's normally the other way around in this format) — there was a feeling that they were short of a few runs.\n\nThere was one significant caveat, however. Sunrisers Eastern Cape's strong suit throughout the tournament has been their bowling. Their batting? Not so much. Skipper Aiden Markram had come on record many times to say the same thing. And so it proved as a misfiring batting unit fell short. When you are chasing in a big final, the conventional wisdom is at least one big partnership up front. Or not losing early wickets. Preferably both.\n\nBut losing a wicket early has been a thing SEC have done all season. Across 13 matches including the final, their average first-wicket partnership was 18.84 (for comparison, MI Cape Town's was 44.45). To be fair, David Bedingham and Tony de Zorzi had one of the hardest tasks up front — not losing a wicket against Kagiso Rabada and Trent Boult. Boult, who guarantees wickets with the new ball, bowled the perfect powerplay spell of 3-0-4-1 while Rabada applied the finishing touches, ending with figures of 4/25.\n\nWith the required run rate over 10 per over from very early on, SEC never really had a chance even if they had Tristan Stubbs and Markram in the middle-order.\n\nThe middle-order, ironically, is where MI Cape Town won the match thanks to an enterprising knock from Brevis, who went six crazy. In a matter of eight balls, he hit four of them above the boundary, including one which was Rishabh Pant-like as he took the bottom hand off the blade but still managed to muscle the slower ball into the stands on the leg side. Marco Jansen accounted for Brevis soon after but his cameo, though, ensured the Cape Town based franchise built up a head of steam through the middle overs after the platform provided by Rickelton and George Linde.\n\nIn the end, their ability to keep finding sixes was what proved to be the difference on the night.\n\nWhat changed\n\nWhile this will still go down as a relatively decent season for SEC — winning teams only tend to measure success by the presence of Cups — how did MI Cape Town turn it around after two seasons in the wilderness?\n\nWhile speaking to the media in January, Rassie van der Dussen, who finished as the second leading run-getter in the league, had spoken about a 'different vibe' in the squad. \"When you do so badly you learn what not do to,\" he was quoted as saying by sabcsport. \"We really took those lessons of the first two years to heart.\"\n\nAs part of those lessons from the past, Van der Dussen, Rabada and a few others made a conscious decision to always back Rashid, the captain. \"It's always tough for an overseas captain coming in, but we made a conscious decision — myself, Colin (Ingram), KG (Rabada), Dane Piedt and some of the senior players — to say, we're going to assist this guy as much as we can.\"\n\nA job well done.",

        "date": "Sun Feb  9 13:04:47 2025",
        "body": "Veteran seamer Trent Boult is having a storied career as a freelance cricketer around the world. After bagging the Major League Cricket (MLC) and the International League T20 (ILT20) titles in recent times, the New Zealand bowler has added the SA20 title to his resume as well.\n\nThe MI Cape Town ended the Sunrisers Eastern Cape's dominance in the league by recording a comprehensive 76-run triumph to cap off a stellar campaign.\n\nThe thing to note is that he has not been a bystander in all these victorious campaigns. In fact, he has played a pivotal role in each title triumph. The left-arm pacer was named player of the match in the final for his spell of 2-9. He accounted for the dismissals of Jordan Hermann and Tristan Stubbs to help his team's cause.\n\nOn that note, let us take a look at three reasons why Trent Boult could be Mumbai Indians' most important player for IPL 2025.\n\n#1 Boult is the missing piece of the puzzle\n\nThere is a reason why MI went all out for Trent Boult in the 2025 mega auction. He was their sole signing that breached the INR 10 crore mark. Apart from their shared history, it is Boult's experience and ability that urged the franchise to bring him back.\n\nWith MI's batting personnel all retained and the bowling spearhead locked in, they needed one more big name to round up the core. MI had big names like Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, and Jasprit Bumrah, but it did not prevent them from finishing last twice in three seasons.\n\nThere were other well-documented factors behind the slump, but from a tactical on-field point of view, MI lacked another experienced and effective figure in the bowling department at times. With his inclusion, MI looks a much more well-rounded unit, while his recent form comes across as an added bonus.\n\n#2 MI needed a proven performer to complement Bumrah\n\nIn a way, Trent Boult is MI's replacement for the Trent Boult they lost out on three years ago in the previous mega auction. One of the pivotal reasons MI had a bleak cycle is the fact that their frontline bowlers lacked prowess and did not click with each other.\n\nThe Bumrah-Archer dream project crashed before taking off. While Bumrah did have an impact, he lacked support from the other end. MI tried a plethora of pacers in this phase while Hardik Pandya also took it upon himself to bowl with the new ball. But none of these measures came even close to replicating the effect Boult had with the new ball.\n\nMI struggled for early breakthroughs consistently, and given the lack of options in the death, they had to use Bumrah's overs judiciously rather than go all-out with him. The partnership between Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult is a combination that has worked successfully in the past. The pair played a huge role in MI's successive title triumphs in 2019 and 2020.\n\nBumrah is already functioning at his best, but having Boult at the other end, will allow him to function more freely, and be even more potent. Oppositions might have no choice but to exercise caution, with pressure being applied from both ends, shaving off valuable deliveries in the powerplay.\n\n#3 Assures MI of tempo at the start\n\nBoult's new ball ability and match-ups with opposition top-order batters almost guarantee his side a headstart. In an era where wickets are worth their weight in gold, and the best possible measure to put pressure on the opponent, the veteran seamer's knack of delivering early breakthroughs is something MI have missed for a while.\n\nThe early burst in momentum could prove to be something from which MI can build on. The lack of wickets early on in recent seasons forced MI to often play catch-up, and they hardly ever dictated the proceedings with the ball. However, having Boult, particularly at the Wankhede, gives MI the opportunity to strike first, rather than waiting for the opposition to make a mistake.",
        "summary": "* Trent Boult, a veteran New Zealand bowler, has won the MLC title recently, adding to his previous titles in the International League T20 (ILT20) and SA20.\n* Boult played a pivotal role in the MLC title win, taking 2-9 in the final and being named player of the match.\n* No other details about the MLC tournament, such as the team Boult played for or the opponents in the final, are mentioned in the article."

        "body": "In a thrilling conclusion to the SA20 season, MI Cape Town has made history by claiming its first title after a dominant performance in the finals held in Johannesburg. This victory adds to the franchise’s illustrious accomplishments in various T20 leagues, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), International League T20 (ILT20), and Major League Cricket (MLC). Under the astute leadership of Rashid Khan, MI Cape Town triumphed over the two-time defending champions, Sunrisers Eastern Cape, by a staggering 76 runs, shattering their hopes of a hat-trick win.\n\nMI Cape Town’s Dominance in the Finals\n\nThe final match, played on February 8, showcased MI Cape Town’s absolute dominance, much like their performance throughout the league stages. After finishing last in the points table during the first two seasons, the team made a spectacular comeback, finishing at the top this time. They not only secured a place in the finals but also showcased an impressive strategy to outplay the defending champions convincingly.\n\nExplosive Innings by Rickelton and Brevis\n\nFrom the outset, MI Cape Town pressured the Sunrisers. Ryan Rickelton set the tone in the second over with an explosive display, smacking Marco Jansen for two sixes and a four. In just 15 balls, Rickelton scored 33 runs before being dismissed, leading his team to a solid start with 50 runs on the board. Although they faced a few setbacks by losing three wickets in quick succession, the young sensation Dewald Brevis dazzled with his powerful hitting, scoring 38 runs off just 18 balls, including four sixes and two fours. Connor Esterhuizen also contributed significantly with a swift 39 runs, helping MI Cape Town to post an imposing total of 181 runs for the loss of 8 wickets. Richard Gleeson shone with the ball for the Sunrisers, taking 2 wickets for 22 runs.\n\nSunrisers Eastern Cape’s Struggles\n\nIn stark contrast, the Sunrisers Eastern Cape had a disastrous start to their innings. Opener David Beddingham, who had even postponed his wedding for this crucial match, was dismissed for just 5 runs in the second over by Kagiso Rabada, who continued to wreak havoc on their batting line-up. The Sunrisers struggled to find momentum, and despite a brief partnership between Tom Abell (30) and Tony de Zorzi (26), it was evident that they were lacking the firepower needed to chase down the target. The pivotal moment came when Rabada took a sensational catch to dismiss captain Aiden Markram (6), leading to further collapses. Ultimately, the Sunrisers bowed out for a mere 105 runs in the 19th over, with Rabada finishing the match with an impressive haul of 4 wickets.\n\nConclusion: A Historic Victory for MI Cape Town\n\nThis significant win not only symbolizes MI Cape Town’s resurgence in the SA20 league but also reinforces the franchise’s reputation as a powerhouse in T20 cricket. With this championship, they add another illustrious title to their collection, and the future looks bright for this talented squad. The fans can only wait eagerly for what comes next in the exciting world of T20 cricket, as MI Cape Town aims to continue its winning legacy in upcoming seasons.",
