        "body": "In June, legendary rivals India and Pakistan played on Long Island, N.Y., in front of 34,000 fans as cricket took center stage in America with the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup and the second successful season of Major League Cricket (MLC). These milestones have spotlighted the sport's potential in the U.S., revealing both progress and untapped opportunities. As cricket looks ahead to its debut at the LA28 Summer Olympics, administrators, broadcasters, and sponsors have a unique chance to amplify its presence in a market that has historically been elusive for the game. The time is now!\n\nCricket is the world’s second-most popular sport, with an estimated 2.5 billion fans. It is most popular in South Asia, the U.K., Australia, South Africa and the Caribbean. Approximately five million hardcore cricket fans live in the U.S., and reports suggest 30 million people across the U.S. have identified themselves as casual fans or shown interest in cricket.\n\nProgress and lessons from the T20 World Cup\n\nLast summer’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup was a significant moment for cricket in the U.S. The tournament brought the sport to Dallas, Florida and New York, showcasing thrilling contests and cultural celebrations. Fans witnessed sold-out matches featuring India and the U.S., and the ICC organized watch parties at Citi Field and World Trade Center in lower Manhattan to connect with fans. However, the World Cup also taught a few lessons. Ticketing strategies, long-term ROI on the modular stadium and 10:30 a.m. ET start times likely alienated existing fans and missed the opportunity to attract new fans.\n\nMajor League Cricket’s blueprint for growth\n\nMLC has emerged as a transformative force in the American sports landscape, laying the groundwork for cricket to thrive in a competitive market. The league features six franchises representing major U.S. cities:\n\nWhile the teams are intrinsically tied to these cities, the first two seasons were played exclusively in Grand Prairie, Texas, and Morrisville, N.C. Plans are reportedly underway to expand games to more markets and soon expand the league from six to eight teams, signaling the league’s ambition to deepen its regional roots.\n\nBy blending international stars with standout domestic talent, including U.S. national team heroes and American-born players such as Aaron Jones, Steven Taylor and Jasdeep Singh, MLC offers a competitive, exciting product. This diverse mix resonates with a growing fan base that includes both traditional cricket enthusiasts and local American sports fans.\n\nThe league’s success is built on a solid foundation of visionary leadership and significant financial backing. High-profile investors include tech titans like Satya Nadella (Microsoft) and Shantanu Narayan (Adobe), entrepreneurs such as Ross Perot Jr. and Sanjay Govil and venture capitalists who bring credibility and resources to the league.
