        "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC), the premier T20 franchise league in the United States, has once again made headlines with its latest domestic draft. MI New York secured the services of Agni Chopra, a standout batter in Indian domestic cricket, for $50,000.\n\nThis marks a significant move for the 26-year-old, who has accumulated 1,804 runs over three Ranji Trophy seasons, boasting an impressive average of 94.94. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Chopra is a natural U.S. citizen, which allowed him to qualify as a domestic player.\n\nHis shift to MLC comes amid reports that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is implementing a policy that would prevent overseas passport holders from competing in Indian domestic tournaments. This move effectively bars Chopra from future participation in the Ranji Trophy, despite his outstanding performances.\n\nAnother major storyline from the draft was the remarkable rise of USA pacer Jasdeep Singh. The 32-year-old fast bowler emerged as the first overall pick, securing a lucrative $75,000 deal with the Seattle Orcas.\n\nHis journey to the top has been nothing short of inspiring—having gone undrafted in 2024, Singh later made a mid-season comeback as a replacement player for Washington Freedom, where he delivered back-to-back match-winning performances.\n\nTexas Super Kings also made a bold move, signing all-rounder Shubham Ranjane for $75,000. Known for his powerful batting and skillful seam bowling, Ranjane became one of the most sought-after players after being unexpectedly released by the Seattle Orcas. The Super Kings further invested in emerging talent, rewarding left-arm seamer Stephen Wiig ($15,000) for his consistent displays in Minor League Cricket over the past four years.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas, aiming to rebuild their squad, picked up 35-year-old Sujit Nayak for $40,000. A former Mumbai Indians and Delhi Daredevils player, Nayak brings a wealth of experience to the franchise. Additionally, they signed USA internationals Steven Taylor ($25,000) and Shayan Jahangir ($20,000) to strengthen their lineup.\n\nMI New York reinforced their batting unit with the acquisitions of Tajinder Singh Dhillon ($50,000) and Sharad Lumba ($15,000), both of whom previously played for Mumbai Indians in 2018. Additionally, they added explosive left-handed batter Kunwarjit Singh ($20,000), a rising star in American T20 leagues.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders, San Francisco Unicorns, and Washington Freedom focused on strategic additions, having retained most of their core players. The Knight Riders spent their remaining $15,000 to acquire left-arm spinner Kartik Gattepalli. Washington Freedom made just one selection, signing left-arm seamer Abhishek Paradkar ($10,000). Meanwhile, the Unicorns secured former Pakistan all-rounder Hammad Azam ($10,000) in the final round.\n\nSeveral promising young talents were rewarded with rookie contracts, including wicketkeeper-batter Rahul Jariwala (Orcas), leg-spinner Adam Khan (Super Kings), and all-rounder Achilles Browne (Unicorns).\n\nNotably, former Sri Lanka international Shehan Jayasuriya, despite his strong performances in recent seasons, went undrafted. Likewise, ex-West Indies opener John Campbell, who is set to become eligible for USA selection in June, was overlooked.\n\nWith MLC continuing to gain traction globally, this year’s draft showcased an exciting blend of experience and emerging talent, setting the stage for a competitive and action-packed season ahead.",

        "date": "Wed Feb 26 07:52:31 2025",
        "body": "Major League Cricket’s third domestic player draft saw some return heroes, Minor League standouts, and plenty of unexpected surprises. Stay tuned for part two later in the week.\n\nMajor League Cricket’s 2025 rosters continued to take shape last week as 16 American cricketers were selected in this year’s MLC domestic player draft, including 15 from 10 different Minor League Cricket teams, seven with some level of USA international experience, and five aged 24 or younger.\n\nLeading into the third iteration of the MLC domestic draft, the final under the current contract agreement with players, teams had no limit on the number of players they could retain from 2024. That meant that league champion Washington Freedom and runner up San Francisco Unicorns had no pressure to deplete their productive domestic stable, though they released one and two domestic players respectively.\n\nAcross the league, 13 mandatory slots opened up. Five of these were from 2023 runners up Seattle Orcas, who surprised fans by releasing 2023 stars Shehan Jayasuriya, Nauman Anwar and Shubham Ranjane. After the Orcas retained only two overseas players, in Proteas batters Heinrich Klassen and Ryan Rickelton, a change in direction was inevitable, but exactly which direction was anybody’s guess.\n\nEarly Rounds\n\nStructured like the 2024 draft, teams picked in reverse order of their finish in the table last season. With Seattle in possession of the largest available purse in the league, the Orcas would get the first pick in the domestic draft, needing at least four total picks before the draft’s end. With that first pick, Seattle would announce the direction of their rebuild with the selection of USA fast bowler, Jessy Singh.\n\nAfter being selected in the 2023 MLC supplemental draft by MI New York and appearing in only one game for the inaugural league champs, Jessy Singh was not retained and went unselected in the 2024 domestic draft. But when fellow USA bowler Saurabh Netravalkar left Washington mid-season for family reasons, Jessy was signed and placed directly into the Freedom attack. He ended up winning two Player of the Match awards in his two matches, taking three wickets in each while helping Washington top the regular season table.\n\nUpon Netravalkar’s return, Jessy was dropped from the Freedom roster, so it was right back in the draft pool for the USA and New Jersey Stallions pacer. At the Orcas, Jessy joins the 2023 Bart King Award winner Cameron Gannon in the pace attack.\n\nAfter New York passed up a chance to pick in the first round, Texas Super Kings used $75,000 of their $100,000 purse to take former Seattle all rounder Shubham Ranjane, the 13th overall player selected in the 2023 domestic player draft. In nine innings across 12 games for Seattle between 2023 and 2024, Ranjane scored 151 runs at an average of 25.16 and a strike rate of 114.39. However, some of those contributions were important in securing victories for Seattle in their 2023 run to the finals. Ranjane joins Calvin Savage and Matthew Tromp as domestic bat options for TSK in the middle to middle-late order.\n\nThe second and third rounds would pass without any team making a pick, until MI New York would double up in the fourth round with a pair of highly regarded batters, Agni Chopra and Tajinder Singh for $50,000 each.\n\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan, 26-year-old Chopra made Ranji Trophy history when he started his first class career with centuries in each of his first four games a year ago. The left-handed opening batter has an average of 94.94 with nine centuries after 20 first class innings for Mizoram, and strikes at 137.61 with four half centuries in 14 T20 innings. Chopra is the only player selected in this year’s draft never to appear in Minor League Cricket.\n\nTajinder was drafted by San Francisco in the third round in 2023, but was not retained following a disappointing debut season. However, the Unicorns liked what they saw, bringing him back in 2024 via the ninth round, but then released him again leading up to this draft. The versatile batter brings value with the ball as a part time off-spinner, and has dominated in Minor League Cricket, helping his Chicago Kingsmen claim the 2024 MiLC title with superb batting performances.\n\nOrcas triple up\n\nSeattle would take the next three bites in rounds five, seven and eight, selecting batters in each spot, with Sujit Nayak, Steven Taylor and Shayan Jahangir joining retained USA stars Aaron Jones, Harmeet Singh and Ali Sheikh as batting options.\n\nNayak, 35, has been selected in the IPL for the Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals in 2012 and 2013. The left-handed batter and spinner stood out for the Seattle Thunderbolts in Minor League Cricket during their Super Eight playoff campaign in 2024.\n\nTaylor and Jahangir need little introduction to American cricket fans. Both are veterans of the USA men’s team and featured in the 2024 ICC T20 Men’s World Cup. New York’s first round choice in 2023, Taylor struggled in his two MLC seasons and was not retained, and saw himself dropped this summer from the national squad. He found form quickly in MiLC at the end of the summer, culminating with centuries on back to back days for Atlanta Fire to end the 2024 campaign. He’s been included in USA’s T20 side currently touring Oman.\n\nJahangir, also a 2023 MI New York selection, was unable to build on the promise from his first MLC season, where he scored 164 runs at an average of 23.42 with a high score of 41. His average dipped to 9.5 with a high score of only 26 in 2024 and he was not retained. “Father Shay” rebounded in October for USA with a pair of 60 run innings in T20is as well as an ODI century against Nepal in Dallas.\n\nNew York would make two of the next three picks, selecting a pair of batters from MiLC’s Baltimore Royals with Kunwarjeet Singh in the eighth round and Sharad Lumba in the ninth. Lumba, 35, had been auctioned to Mumbai Indians in 2018, but did not appear in a game. In this year’s MiLC Super Eight, he scored 131 runs in three innings at a strike rate of 170 for Baltimore. Kunwarjeet showed his class by scoring 90 runs for the Royals against the Fort Lauderdale Lions at Church Street Park, and showed flashes during the Super Eight.\n\nSandwiched between the New York selections, Los Angeles Knight Riders finally made their lone selection with 24 year old left arm orthodox bowler from Houston Hurricanes, Karthik Gattepalli.\n\n“It goes beyond just my hard work”\n\nGattepalli was at his home in bed on Wednesday night when he received the notification of his selection. “ I was watching the highlights for the Champions Trophy game,” Gattepalli told Emerging Cricket. “And then I just had an email notification at a strange time. So I figured it was either a spam email or something very, very important.” Though he stood out on the USA U19 Men’s team in 2017, Gattepalli credits his experiences with Houston Hurricanes in Minor League, playing alongside the likes of Ali Khan and Usman Rafiq, with helping him realize his potential.\n\n“ I didn’t know that I had the capabilities that I did until Minor League happened. It was an eye opener for me, playing with and playing against some international players and some really high quality players, that was the first time,” he said of the 26 team domestic league. “So it really provided me with a pathway. It also showed that there’s a skill set and a set of talent not only in me, but across the country, which was great.”\n\nA financial analyst in his home town of Dallas, Gattepalli anxiously awaits the chance to play in front of family and friends so close to his home at Grand Prairie stadium, host venue for the vast majority of MLC games in seasons one and two.\n\n“I’d be lying if I said that I could get any sleep after the news. It goes beyond just my hard work and what I put in. There’s a lot of time and sacrifice that my parents made, along with my family members and loved ones. Having the chance to be playing at home and having them there, it’s just a way for me to give back to them.”\n\n“I think there’s no better and greater feeling than having them there, seeing a smile on their face and seeing how proud they are for the amount of work that they’ve put in to help me be where I’m at now.”\n\nValue in the late rounds\n\nWith the final pick in the 9th round, Texas Super Kings took recent USA Cricket international debutant, left-arm fast bowler Steven Wiig of the New Jersey Stallions. In 154.4 overs across 46 career Minor League Cricket innings, Wiig has grabbed 59 wickets at an economy of 6.70 for the perennial contender New Jersey Stallions in the East Division. Wiig’s ability to take wickets in the power play and at the death contributed to his reputation as a clutch performer with a ability to bowl wide yorkers accurately. At TSK, he will join NJ Stallions and USA teammate Sai Mukkamalla.\n\nClosing out the “senior” portion of the draft in round ten, San Francisco drafted MLC veteran allrounder Hammad Azam and Washington selected USA veteran left arm fast bowler, Abhishek Paradkar.\n\nWhile Azam has failed to produce at the MLC level in two seasons with New York and Seattle, his reputation as a valuable all rounder and top notch captain was strengthened by a good finish in the 2024 Minor League Cricket season. The 2021 MiLC MVP struggled through a regular season with Chicago Kingsmen averaging only 13.75 with the bat. However, he finished the year with an incredible Player of the Match performance in the MiLC Final. With Chicago down five wickets requiring 74 to win from only 47 balls, Azam dominated the East Bay Blazers bowling with a scorching knock of 53 from 23 balls to seal the title for the Kingsmen.\n\nParadkar was in the midst of his best MiLC season in 2024 but missed out on the Super Eight while on tour with USA Cricket in Windhoek. A former fixture on the Silicon Valley Strikers team along with fellow USA and Washington Freedom bowler Netravalkar, Paradkar helped East Bay Blazers to the top of the West table and has 41 wickets in 31 career games at an economy of 7.34. He joins Washington’s domestic fast bowling troupe of Netravalkar, Justin Dill and Ian Holland, as Freedom fill off-spinner Akhilesh Bodugum’s vacancy with fast bowling depth.\n\nStay tuned for part two of the 2025 MLC Domestic Draft review.

        "body": "Steven Taylor, a seasoned American cricketer with a decade-long international career, has been drafted by the Seattle Orcas for the 2025 Major League Cricket (MLC) season. The left-handed top-order batsman and right-arm off-spinner brings a wealth of experience to the franchise, having played for the United States national team since 2010 and competing in multiple domestic leagues worldwide.\n\nTaylor, born on November 9, 1993, first gained prominence in 2010 when he was selected for the United States U-19 squad at the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. His performance as a wicketkeeper-batsman in that tournament marked the beginning of a flourishing career. Later that year, he played a pivotal role in the USA’s ICC World Cricket League Division Four triumph, contributing significantly to their promotion efforts.\n\nIn subsequent years, Taylor emerged as one of the United States’ most reliable batsmen. He became the first U.S. cricketer to score a century in a Twenty20 match, registering 101 off 62 balls against Bermuda in 2013. His record-breaking performances continued when he notched up an unbeaten 127 against the Cayman Islands. During the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three tournament, he topped the scoring charts with 274 runs, including a 162-run innings against Nepal.\n\nTaylor’s career saw him feature in top-tier leagues, including the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), where he played for multiple teams such as the Guyana Amazon Warriors and the Barbados Tridents. His versatility and consistency made him a sought-after player, securing contracts in the Pakistan Super League and the Bangladesh Premier League.\n\nIn 2019, Taylor played a key role in the USA's success at the ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament, where the team secured One Day International (ODI) status. That same year, he was named vice-captain for the United States squad in the T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier tournament. His performances earned him a central contract with USA Cricket, solidifying his position as a cornerstone of the national team.\n\nTaylor’s domestic career has been equally impressive. He made his first-class debut for Jamaica in the 2017–18 Regional Four Day Competition and participated in the Minor League Cricket (MiLC) tournament in the United States in 2021. In 2023, he joined MI New York for the inaugural Major League Cricket season, demonstrating his adaptability in different playing conditions.\n\nHis recent selection by the Seattle Orcas for the 2025 MLC season is expected to bolster the team’s batting lineup. MLC, which debuted in 2023, has rapidly grown into a premier T20 league in the United States, attracting international talent and expanding its reach. With plans to increase from six to ten teams and extend the season to 34 games by 2025, the competition is set to become a staple in the global cricket calendar.\n\nSeattle Orcas, one of the founding MLC franchises, have been strengthening their squad ahead of the new season. Taylor’s inclusion adds experience and firepower to their batting order, making them strong contenders for the upcoming campaign.",

        "body": "Agni Chopra, born to Bollywood producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra and critic Anupama Chopra, was drafted by MI New York for $50,000 in Major League Cricket. Despite growing up in a showbiz family, Agni pursued cricket, overcoming challenges tied to his privileged status, and excelling in domestic tournaments. Now, he moves to American cricket, eyeing international opportunities.\n\nFile photo of Agni Chopra in domestic cricket. (Instagram)\n\nOn 19th February, around 9pm Pacific Standard Time, Agni Chopra boarded his Air India flight from San Francisco to Mumbai. It was also the night for the privately held Major League Cricket ( MLC ) domestic draft to which Agni looked forward to with nervous anticipation. That nervous energy would grip him for the next 17 hours as the flight provided no Wi-Fi option to communicate to the outside world. However, as he prepared for the take off, little did he know that his cricket career was about to take wings as well, in the country of his birth.\n\n\"I couldn't wait to land. After landing I saw a text from my mom saying that I had been picked up by MI New York for $50,000! I was alone in the plane, and I couldn't really shout or do anything as that would have been very weird since we had just landed. It kind of felt like a full circle moment because I come from the city where the franchise is based. I have been a lifelong MI fan. I just had that moment of gratitude for everyone that's been part of my journey, my family, my coaches especially KP ( Khushpreet Singh Aulakh ) and all my teammates over the years,\" said Agni.\n\nGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!\n\nBorn into a showbiz family of celebrated Bollywood producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra and eminent film critic Anupama Chopra , the journey that Agni referred to, quite serendipitously carries the elements of a Bollywood blockbuster. Right from the time he set foot at Shivaji Park as a six-year-old, his journey has been of highs and lows. An enduring journey of a 'misfit' cricketer trying his best to be a 'Bambaiya' boy. A success story of a player and a coach with an unshakable faith in each other. And many things in between a bad break up and a terrific record break.\n\nDespite being brought up in a showbiz household, Agni never took to movies the way other star kids in the industry naturally do. \"My dad would always tell my mom, 'Yeh kiska beta hain? Mera toh nai ho sakta hain' after he saw that I was drawn to cricket and other sports and wasn't really interest in films (laughs)\". He had stars in his periphery as a child but the presence of that star quotient around him inspired him to strive for success and glory in the sphere of life he was fascinated to.\n\nAgni Chopra (C) with father Vidhu Vinod Chopra (R) and mother Anupama Chopra (L) at the BCCI Awards.\n\n\"It was like a decision that I made for myself, and since I was six years old, I've always loved cricket, and there was no logic or no reason behind it. It wasn't like my parents made me watch cricket, or I was deliberately exposed to cricket. At six years old, I told my mom I wanted to play cricket, and she took me to Shivaji Park.\"\n\nFrom privileged to the underprivileged, cricket is played by an entire strata of society in Mumbai. Moreover, the proportion of affluent class may have seen a dip in numbers on the Mumbai maidans in the recent years. For the 'privileged' young Agni it was always a constant battle at Shivaji Park and beyond in shedding the 'misfit' tag. About taking pains of vanquishing the preconceived notions about his background. And a perennial effort to be 'one of them.' If his privilege off the field was a boon, that privilege soon would become a bane on it.\n\n\"At the age of eight or 10, people didn't look at me differently. I was just one of the boys. The only difference was that I didn't know Marathi coming from a Punjabi family. So at the time, I started learning Marathi. Then when I was about 12, I could kind of sense that people would look at me differently, or they would speak to me differently, and that at the time, I couldn't understand what it was. But then I understood that it was because of my background. And at the time, I became very aware of certain things, and I would try my best to fit in.\"\n\n\"One example is I used to practice at MiG ground, close to my school. But I would go from school to the ground, and I had a driver with me, so I would always tell the driver that he park the car a few blocks away. And then I'd walk five minutes to the ground, so that nobody knew that I was coming with a car or I had a driver because I didn't want to stand out in that way. And even when I leave, I'd do the same and make sure that nobody would see me. So that was just something that I tried to do to fit in, because I didn't want to be different, or I didn't ask to be different either.\"\n\nAgni felt the pangs of 'privilege' not just amongst peers but in general perception amongst a few coaches and selectors as well. The dogmas around Agni's cricket had many even doubting his love for the game.\n\n\"The preconceived notion was that 'he's not a good guy because he is a rich kid'. 'He doesn't care about cricket because he's a rich man's son'. 'He doesn't have to play cricket'. 'He'll quit cricket', and 'he's not interested in cricket'. Basically, that was kind of the notion that without me saying anything, or without meeting me or judging me as a person, that is what people thought. I knew a few selectors also thought similarly during my first couple of under-19 years. There were times where people would not like me or not think that I was fit to be in the Mumbai team, purely because of this reason.\"\n\nAgni managed to get a level of acceptance in the cricketing fraternity by reaching across the aisle in different ways but he knew he could only command respect by what he does between the 22 yards.\n\nHe enjoyed his first real moment in the sun after amassing nearly 800 runs in 10 games in the Col. C.K. Nayudu Trophy, a BCCI U-23 tournament, in the 2019-20 season. He ended up topping the run charts for Mumbai with three hundreds including a double century. Agni credited that reincarnation as a batter to his coach and now brotherly figure Khushpreet Singh Aulakh. The pair have been working together since July 2019.\n\nFile photo of Agni Chopra. (Instagram)\n\n\"When we first met, he didn't have that belief in himself. And that belief comes from practice. We elevated the level of his practice. He had never played over 200 balls in a net session before that. We set targets like playing 25,000 balls per month. A good thing about him is that he is not lazy. If I ask him to wake up at 5 am and train he was willing to do that,\" said Khushpreet.\n\nWhile Agni surrendered his mind and body to Khushpreet's modus operandi, it took time for him to be his guardian at heart. Agni had sent an SOS call to Khushpreet after failing in the first two games of the C.K. Nayudu trophy. Khushpreet left for Himachal Pradesh to help Agni turn the tide. The counsel worked as Agni duly notched a double hundred in the next game against Bengal and remained prolific with the bat throughout the tournament thereafter.\n\n\"KP introduced me to Shubman Gill and he has been another major influence in my life. We struck it off right away and started spending a lot more time with each other. What was happening with me was that I only cared about results, and Shubman is completely opposite. Shubman cares about the process. He makes the process paramount and results irrelevant. I benefited a lot from being around him,\" added Agni.\n\nAgni Chopra. (Pic Credit - X)\n\nThe summit of the 2019-20 season, however, was followed by an abyss post-COVID that stretched till mid 2023. He failed to get the backing of the Mumbai selectors for the 2020-21 Ranji Trophy season, something a youngster would typically get after a stellar CK Nayudu trophy. A freak nail injury had him grounded for a bit of 2022 and he came to his wits end when he lost his place in the XI at Dadar Union, his primary club.\n\n\"It was at that moment I had given up my dream of playing in the Ranji Trophy for Mumbai. It was a really big blow to me. I felt like 'I'm done playing cricket.' Because I was 22 and had been dropped from my Mumbai club team. I was also with this girl at the time, and I went through a breakup. It was a bit messy, it wasn't the best situation. I'd never experienced that before, because I had never, kind of dated anyone. I was only playing cricket. But through that period I was very low. There were times where I would think about quitting and letting it go or doing something else, but that love for cricket really sustained me.\"\n\nAgni Chopra received the Madhavrao Scindia Award for Top Run Getter in Ranji Trophy Plate League from Rohit Sharma. (BCCI Photo)\n\nA call up to the Mizoram squad for the Ranji Trophy Plate Division aided Agni in putting those distractions to bed. That moment of reckoning he had yearned for while grinding day-in, day-out had finally arrived. The left-hander seized the moment by the scruff of its neck and blazed his way into the record books with four centuries in his first four First-Class games. He ended the season with a whopping 939 runs in six games. He emulated his superhuman effort the next season to sustain a collective average of 94.94 over 13 First-Class games.\n\n\"I've never in my life thought that I have more than one game to play, or two games to play max, because if you don't perform well in two games, you're dropped in Mumbai. It's as simple as that. I was relishing the fact that I have an entire season to play here for Mizoram. You become a different cricketer after a sense of security and it has a positive impact in the way you practice as well.\"\n\nAgni maintains that he has no qualms in retiring from the First-Class game in India despite the highs of the past two seasons. An American passport holder by virtue of his birth, he was pushed to come to this decision after BCCI mandated participation only from Indian passport holders for the Ranji Trophy. He confided that it wasn't an easy decision since days cricket is still the pinnacle of the game for him but it was more of a practical decision given the pecking order he finds himself in for India selection. Besides, the lure of locking horns against some of the best in the world while being at the peak of his powers was quite simply too big of an opportunity to let go.\n\n\"It has always been my dream of playing the Ranji Trophy, playing in the Elite Division and going on to win the title. Playing in the MLC and US opens the doors for me to play international cricket as well. I would have still applied for an Indian passport and stayed if I had been picked in the Indian Premier League (IPL) but looking forward to my time in America now.\"\n\nAgni is an avid reader and a big believer in the philosophical idea of manifestation. He read a self-help book titled 'Tipping Point' during COVID which professed a motivation theory through an extended metaphor of how seemingly insignificant adding a drop of water everyday to a glass is, until the time it overflows at some point. Agni takes great heart from the midnight oil he has been burning over the past five years which in turn has fuelled an unbridled surge in his runs and stocks - an ascent reflected in his selection as MI New York's No. 1 draft pick.\n\nStay updated with the latest sports news and find out how to watch the ICC Champions Trophy live in Canada and the USA.

        "summary": "Agni Chopra, the son of Bollywood producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra and critic Anupama Chopra, has been drafted by MI New York for $50,000 in the Major League Cricket (MLC) domestic draft. Agni, an American passport holder by virtue of his birth, will be playing in the MLC tournament, eyeing international opportunities. This decision comes after he was forced to retire from First-Class cricket in India due to the BCCI's mandate that only Indian passport holders can participate in the Ranji Trophy. Agni's selection in the MLC is a significant milestone in his cricketing career, which has been marked by challenges and successes despite his privileged background."
