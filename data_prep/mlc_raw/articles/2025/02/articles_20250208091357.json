        "date": "Fri Feb  7 16:24:50 2025",
        "body": "The Indian Premier League is all set to scale greater heights in the upcoming eighteenth season. The IPL has been nothing short of a revolution in the franchise cricket market and has played a great role in transforming the sport. The IPL is a breeding ground for youngsters where they get to rub shoulders with the greats of the game. There are many other players in the market such as the Big Bash League, Bangladesh Premier League, Pakistan Super League, Major League Cricket and others, but nobody comes close to the IPL.\n\nThe amount of star power that the Indian Premier League has is unmatched. All the top stars of international cricket playing the cash-rich league for two months straight is no small feat, but the Indian Premier League has walked the talk and has built one of the biggest brand in the sport.\n\nGraeme Smith Credits The IPL For The Success Of SA20\n\nSA20 commissioner Graeme Smith has pledged to make it the second best league in the world after admitting that the IPL remains the leader of franchise cricket, from where they can \"only learn\" to get better.\n\nALSO READ | Ponting Astonished Over Shreyas Iyer Lacking Fixed Role In Indiaâ€™s White-Ball Side\n\nThe third season of SA20 is currently underway across venues in South Africa. \"BCCI and IPL have been amazing in supporting us and guiding us in every decision we have made. IPL is the leader in franchise cricket by far and we can only learn from them,\" Smith told PTI Bhasha in an exclusive interview here.\n\nSmith Breaks Silence On Indian Players Participating In SA20\n\nIPL veteran Dinesh Karthik this year became the first Indian player to feature in SA20 by appearing for Paarl Royals, who lost the second qualifier against two-time champion Sunrisers Eastern Cape in Centurion on Thursday.\n\nALSO READ | Suresh Raina's Huge Prediction For Rohit Sharma In ICC Champions Trophy\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of having more Indian players in future, Smith said they would love to have them if they were available, but nothing of that sort is in the pipeline as of now. \"We always said that we have worked with the BCCI to see what their views are for the future. South African cricket loves Indian cricketers. It is always a highlight for us to watch the talent of the Indian team whenever they come here to play,\" said the 44-year-old former captain who led South Africa to a record 54 Test victories.",
        "summary": "There is no mention of the Major League Cricket tournament in this article. The article primarily focuses on the Indian Premier League (IPL) and its impact on franchise cricket, as well as the SA20 league in South Africa. It does mention Major League Cricket in a list of other cricket leagues, but there is no further information or discussion about the tournament."
