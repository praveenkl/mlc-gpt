        "body": "One of MLC (Major League Cricket) team owner Sanjay Govil recently discussed the involvement of the NFL legend Tom Brady's in cricket and the impact of US investors in this sport. Cricket has long been a popular sport, deeply rooted in countries like India, Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies. However, its global reach has been somewhat limited. Efforts are now underway to expand the sport’s presence, and the progress is evident. The United States cricket team made history at the ICC T20 World Cup last year by defeating one of the sport’s powerhouses, Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, Major League Cricket (MLC) was launched in the U.S. to further propel cricket onto the global stage. Recently, Indian-American businessman Sanjay Govil, who owns the Washington Freedom team in MLC, spoke exclusively with Sports Tak about the growing presence of U.S. investors in cricket, including none other than NFL legend Tom Brady.\n\nTom Brady joins the Cricket revolution: Sanjay Govil sheds light on the sport’s growth in the U.S.\n\nSanjay Govil appeared in an exclusive interview with Sports Tak’s Vikrant Gupta on Monday, discussing the evolution of cricket in the United States and other regions where the sport has not traditionally been a major attraction. During the conversation, Govil highlighted the growing trend of American investors backing cricket leagues, viewing them as promising business opportunities.\n\nIn one particular segment, Govil spoke about The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the United Kingdom. The league features eight teams, and acquiring ownership required investors to participate in a competitive bidding process.\n\nMumbai Indians, one of the most successful franchises in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with five championship titles, secured ownership of the Oval Invincibles. Meanwhile, the Birmingham Phoenix team was acquired by a U.S.-based investment group, which notably includes seven-time Super Bowl champion Brady.\n\nDiscussing this game-changing development, Govil stated:\n\n\"As you know, The Hundred, a cricket league in the United Kingdom, features eight teams. In a recent bid, Mumbai Indians acquired Oval Invincibles, while the Birmingham team was secured by US investors. Notably, one of the members of this investment group is Tom Brady, the legendary American football player with seven Super Bowl titles. The involvement of American investors in cricket is a significant development, as it has led to a shift in perception—these cricket teams are now being viewed as valuable assets, much like stocks and cryptocurrency.\" [4:31 onwards]\n\nThe entry of high-profile figures like Brady into cricket investments signals a major shift in how the sport is perceived outside its traditional markets. With growing financial backing and a rising fanbase in the U.S., cricket is steadily positioning itself as a global sport, with leagues like MLC and The Hundred playing a pivotal role in its expansion.",

        "body": "Sanjay Govil, a team owner in Major League Cricket (MLC), recently discussed the significant role of US cricketer Saurabh Netravalkar in shaping the sport in the United States. Netravalkar, a key figure in the American cricket team, led his country to a historic debut in the ICC T20 World Cup last year. As an associate member, the US team faced formidable opponents, but the team’s stunning victory over Pakistan, one of the most dominant cricketing nations, took everyone by surprise. While expectations were low for the rookie team, Netravalkar’s brilliant leadership and performances made a lasting impact on both the tournament and the future of US cricket.\n\nNetravalkar’s heroics in the match against Pakistan are a key highlight. He was one of the standout performers, taking vital wickets during the match and even delivering an unforgettable Super Over, where he once again took a wicket. His contributions were integral to the US team's unexpected success, and the win over Pakistan became one of the most talked-about moments of the tournament. Reflecting on Netravalkar’s influence, Govil shared his thoughts during an exclusive interview with Sports Tak’s Vikrant Gupta.\n\nGovil talks about Saurabh Netravalkar’s rising talent\n\nIn his conversation with Vikrant Gupta, Sanjay Govil shared how he and his team, Washington Freedom, have been instrumental in developing US cricket talent. He mentioned that Netravalkar was one of the early players identified for his exceptional potential. Govil and his team have worked hard to provide these players with top-tier coaching opportunities. As part of their efforts, they sent Netravalkar and other emerging talents to Australia, known for its cricketing excellence, to enhance their skills.\n\nGovil emphasized that this training had a direct impact on the US team’s impressive performance against Pakistan. The exposure and training the players received were evident in their ability to compete at the highest level.\n\nAs Govil noted, \"We have helped several US players, with the most notable being Saurabh Netravalkar, whose talent we recognized early on. Since the inception of Major League Cricket (MLC) two years ago, we have sent these players to Australia for training. Everyone witnessed their remarkable performance against Pakistan (in the ICC T20 World Cup), which ultimately led to the US defeating Pakistan.\" [4:05 Onwards]\n\nGovil’s insights shed light on the growing influence of Major League Cricket and the crucial role of players like Netravalkar in putting US cricket on the global map. The team's achievements have ignited a newfound excitement for the sport in the United States, paving the way for more international opportunities and recognition in the cricketing world.",

The Invincibles will join a stable of teams that stretches across India, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.\n\nEdgbaston-based Birmingham Phoenix were next up, with Birmingham City owners Knighthead – for whom NFL great Brady acts as a minority investor – reportedly succeeding in a UK£40 million (US$49.6 million) deal.\n\nAll parties will now enter a period of exclusivity, during which time the relevant due diligence must take place ahead of the final agreement.\n\nFormer Gloucestershire spinner Vikram Banerjee, now director of business operations at the ECB, is leading the sale process on behalf of the governing body, with the project being run in concert with Raine Group and Deloitte.\n\nThe early valuations of the Hundred teams bodes well for the ECB to beat its basement valuation of around UK£350 million (US$434 million) for 100 per cent of all eight sides. A ten per cent share of funds raised will be steered towards the recreational game, with all 18 first-class counties – including non-hosts – and the MCC sharing the remainder.\n\nThe ECB hopes for a smooth end to what has been a protracted process but is understood to be prepared for public gripes from groups that are not successful.",
        "summary": "The owners of the Washington Freedom, a franchise in the Major League Cricket tournament, have reportedly purchased a 49% stake in the Welsh Fire, a team in the Hundred cricket tournament, for around £65 million. This deal is part of a larger process in which the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is selling 49% stakes in each of the eight Hundred teams to investors."

        "date": "Mon Feb  3 12:28:00 2025",
        "body": "Weil Gotshal & Manges has hired partner Steve Argeris from the bustling corporate sports law practice at Hogan Lovells, making a push into an increasingly active industry for the law firm’s private equity clients.\n\nThe Washington and New York-based Argeris has been part of deals teams representing the buyers of the NFL’s Washington Commanders and Denver Broncos. He’s advised on deals involving Major League Soccer, National Women’s Soccer League, Major League Cricket and Major League Pickleball, and worked on investments in sports-related businesses.\n\nFor a firm with a strong private equity practice, Argeris’ hire is a response to a surge of sports industry investment ranging from Big Four sports franchises to media companies, emerging sports leagues, and even companies that maintain stadium grass.\n\n“We have to be in a position where we are able to service our clients in all of the key industry verticals in which they participate, and sports is one of those,” Kyle Krpata, co-head of Weil’s U.S. Private Equity practice, said in an interview. Argeris’ hire “adds expertise to broaden our capabilities and make us more of an interesting partner to our clients.”\n\nKrpata said there is a “huge opportunity” to advise the firm’s clients on sports deals work. He cited the recent NFL decision to allow private equity ownership and the explosion of college-level name, image and likeness deals, saying Argeris’ past experience in both areas made him “the perfect addition.”\n\nPrivate Equity Pumps Deals\n\nThere was $34 billion worth of sports and technology deals in the first half of 2024, up more than three times the previous half-year period, according to a report from investment bank Drake Star. That activity comes as sports-specific investment firms, such as Red Bird Capital, Arctos Partners or Dynasty Equity, pump billions of private capital into the sports world.\n\nThe booming size of sports deals—teams have sold for north of $6 billion—has drawn the interest of law firms that are known for handling the largest corporate transactions including Latham & Watkins, Davis Polk & Wardwell, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz—and now Weil.\n\nThe once-niche sports transactions practice has historically been dominated by a handful of firms with deep ties to the major leagues, including Hogan Lovells, Covington & Burling, Proskauer Rose, DLA Piper and, more recently, Sidley Austin.\n\nWeil has longstanding sports ties of its own. Litigation partner Andrew Tulumello often represents leagues or athletes in the context of litigation or investigations, including then-New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in the infamous “Deflategate” scandal.\n\nThe firm last year represented Major League Baseball star Shohei Ohtani and the MLB Players Association in a class action related to their endorsement of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nArgeris will bolster its transactional offerings in the sports world. He had some personal connections to Weil, including having spent his 1L summer as an intern for Weil’s now antitrust co-head Michael Moiseyev while he was working at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\n“Weil is one of a very small number of elite private equity shops and it was an incredible opportunity to meld what I’ve been doing and building while really standing on the platform that Kyle and his team have already built,” Argeris said in an interview. “This is work that we know these asset managers increasingly care about.”\n\nFor its part, Hogan Lovells’ sports group has stayed busy, closing a deal last month as adviser to Texas-based private equity firm Presidio Investors on its acquisition of Hellas Verona, a team in Italy’s Serie A soccer league.\n\nA onetime sportswriter for the Washington Post, Argeris started his Big Law career at Willkie Farr & Gallagher and also worked at Hunton & Williams. In 2015 he went to work for Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper’s Tepper Sports & Entertainment, leaving as its general counsel in 2020.\n\nAt Hogan Lovells, he advised on some of the largest sports franchise sales and investments. He guided in November the family that owns real estate investment management firm Morgan Properties in purchasing a limited partnership interest to join MLB’s Philadelphia Phillies ownership group.\n\nArgeris late last year was also part of the Hogan Lovells team advising Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai on an investment in the NFL’s Miami Dolphins.\n\nThe NFL is poised to be an active space for dealmaking after the league last year allowed select private equity groups to invest in its franchises. The first of those deals took place last year when Ares purchased 10% of the Dolphins and Arctos acquired a stake in the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThat leaves more than two dozen other potential deals to be made, which Argeris and Krpata said are a natural target for Weil’s team.\n\n“With Steve’s background being directly in the league and then the transactions that he’s worked on while at law firms,” Krpata said, “all of that will be very valuable to us.”",
        "summary": "* Steve Argeris, a partner from Hogan Lovells, has been hired by Weil Gotshal & Manges to expand their private equity practice into the sports industry, which includes Major League Cricket.\n* Argeris has advised on deals involving Major League Cricket, among other sports leagues, and has experience working on investments in sports-related businesses.\n\nNo additional information about the Major League Cricket tournament is mentioned in the article beyond these two points. The focus of the article is on the growth of the sports industry and the law firms that are expanding their practices to serve private equity clients in this space."

        "date": "Tue Feb  4 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "Cricketers who played gully cricket and grew up with a passion for the sport have contributed to what has become a movement spanning over four to five decades. Sanjay Govil, a team owner in Major League Cricket (MLC), emphasized the impact of India’s 1983 World Cup victory in igniting this passion.\n\n“The 40-50 year, starting from 83 World Cup win, right? It's been a movement. That movement has started here. So I'm not saying it will take 50 years, right? Like in India, we went from the wireless to the wireless through telecom, right? We skipped the whole middle part, right? So that will be here.”\n\nThe Role of IPL and BCCI in Shaping Cricket\n\nGovil acknowledged the monumental influence of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in shaping modern cricket.\n\n“The IPL has set a big trend and the leadership of BCCI which is now in the ICC, you know, it's amazing. But my only request is that we have to have more countries playing cricket, which is going to make it even a stronger international thing. And MLC is in that direction and now hopefully hundreds also.”\n\nThe Importance of Infrastructure for MLC’s Growth\n\nGovil pointed out that improving infrastructure and playing conditions will be crucial in determining the success of MLC.\n\n“If your grounds get better, I believe that people followed MLC last year and this year it will follow a bit more. If the grounds, infrastructure, playing conditions get better, you never know. You never know. You can easily get into the top 3-4 leagues of the world.”\n\nMLC’s Position in the Global Cricketing Landscape\n\nWhile IPL remains unparalleled, Govil believes MLC has the potential to be a major force in global cricket.\n\n“No, no, absolutely. I think obviously IPL is untouched, right? I am saying it in the second tier, but if I have to say it in the second, I will say it in the third tier.”\n\nThe Future of Cricket Leagues\n\nGovil shared his predictions for the future of global cricket leagues, highlighting MLC and The Hundred as the most promising among emerging competitions.\n\n“I think the two main leagues will be MLC and Hundred. My prediction. Maybe I am biased because I have seen both.”\n\nGovil’s insights, shared during an exclusive interview with Sports Tak’s Vikrant Gupta, shed light on the evolving cricket landscape and the promising trajectory of MLC.\n\nDiscussing this game-changing development, Govil stated:\n\n\"As you know, The Hundred, a cricket league in the United Kingdom, features eight teams. In a recent bid, Mumbai Indians acquired Oval Invincibles, while the Birmingham team was secured by US investors. Notably, one of the members of this investment group is Tom Brady, the legendary American football player with seven Super Bowl titles. The involvement of American investors in cricket is a significant development, as it has led to a shift in perception—these cricket teams are now being viewed as valuable assets, much like stocks and cryptocurrency.\"",
        "summary": "**MLC's Significance**: Sanjay Govil, a team owner in MLC, believes that the league has the potential to be a major force in global cricket, although it may not surpass the Indian Premier League (IPL) in popularity.\n\n**Influence of IPL and BCCI**: Govil acknowledges the significant impact of IPL and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on modern cricket, which has paved the way for other leagues like MLC.\n\n**Infrastructure Development**: Improving infrastructure and playing conditions are crucial for MLC's growth and success, according to Govil. If the league can achieve this, it could easily become one of the top 3-4 leagues in the world.\n\n**Global Cricketing Landscape**: Govil predicts that MLC and The Hundred (a UK-based cricket league) will be the two main leagues in the future, marking a shift in the global cricket landscape. He also notes that the involvement of American investors, including Tom Brady, in cricket teams is a significant development, indicating that these teams are now viewed as valuable assets.\n\nOverall, the article suggests that MLC is an emerging force in global cricket, with significant potential for growth and success, pending infrastructure development and increased investment."
