        "body": "by Smit Patel • Last updated on\n\nLAKR, MI NY and SF Unicorns domestic rosters. © Cricbuzz\n\nThe Major League Cricket teams have announced their domestic player retention lists ahead of the domestic player draft, set to take place on February 19. While teams like Washington Freedom, Los Angeles Knight Riders, and San Francisco Unicorns have opted to retain almost all of their domestic contingent, others, such as MI New York, Texas Super Kings, and Seattle Orcas, have chosen to offload nearly half of their domestic rosters.\n\nSeattle Orcas enter the draft with the highest remaining purse of USD 180,000 after releasing several high-profile former internationals, including Shehan Jayasuriya, Nauman Anwar, and Hammad Azam. Reports suggest that Jayasuriya may have requested an early release from his contract after being benched during the early stages of last year's tournament due to fitness concerns, particularly regarding his weight.\n\nAnother unexpected non-retention was star all-rounder Shubham Ranjane. Despite his talent, Ranjane was largely underutilised by the Orcas, which may have prompted him to enter the player draft. Furthermore, he is widely expected to be the league's number-one draft pick, a move that would grant the Maharashtra-born all-rounder a 50 percent pay hike.\n\nMI New York made a bold decision by parting ways with Steven Taylor, their first-ever draft pick back in 2023. The franchise initially took a leap of faith on Taylor's T20 potential but ultimately lost patience after two underwhelming seasons with the bat.\n\nSO, TSK and WF rosters ©Cricbuzz\n\nAnother significant omission was USA wicketkeeper-batsman Shayan Jahangir. The news comes as a double setback for Jahangir, who is already dealing with visa issues that prevented him from participating in the ongoing ODI tri-series in Oman. Additionally, Ruben Clinton, MI's top pick in last year's domestic draft, was also released following a string of low scores at the top of the order.\n\nTexas Super Kings' Raj Nannan, another former number-one draft pick, was also let go. However, the left-arm spinner may feel hard done by, having been dropped without getting a single game. The Super Kings further parted ways with former Pakistan first-class leg-spinner Zia Shehzad, who played just one match during his two-season stint with the franchise.\n\nTeams like Washington Freedom, Los Angeles Knight Riders, and San Francisco Unicorns are unlikely to make significant moves in the draft, with only USD 15,000, USD 10,000, and USD 10,000, respectively, remaining from their USD 320,000 domestic purse. However, the draft promises to be a high-stakes affair for MI New York, Texas Super Kings, and Seattle Orcas, as they look to rebuild after shedding nearly half of their domestic squads. They enter the draft with remaining purses of USD 160,000, USD 100,000, and USD 180,000, respectively.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet"

The BCCI's position has been very clear. At some point, we'd love to see Indian players come and play in England.\n\nWe currently see them in bilaterals and quite a lot in county cricket. But that’s not something we have predetermined through this process.\"\n\nGould also reassured that Pakistani cricketers would not face restrictions in The Hundred due to IPL influence.\n\nSince 2008, no Pakistani players have participated in the IPL due to political tensions between India and Pakistan, though no formal directive has been issued by the BCCI.\n\n\"We are aware of the challenges Pakistani players face in other regions, but that won’t be happening here,\" Gould stated, confirming the ECB's stance on maintaining inclusivity.\n\nThe ECB also hopes that closer collaboration with IPL franchise owners will eventually secure The Hundred a dedicated window in the global cricket calendar.\n\nPreviously, the tournament has overlapped with the MLC and the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), leading to conflicts over player availability.\n\nThis year, the MLC will conclude before The Hundred, but there remains a two-week overlap with the CPL.\n\nThree of The Hundred’s new investors—Reliance (MI New York), GMR (Seattle Orcas) and Welsh Fire's prospective 50% co-owner Sanjay Govil (Washington Freedom)—are also involved in the MLC.\n\nWith former Professional Cricketers' Association commercial director Johnny Grave now serving as the CEO of The Hundred, the ECB sees potential for better coordination of scheduling.\n\nVikram Banerjee, the ECB’s director of business operations, highlighted the advantages of aligning The Hundred’s schedule with other global T20 leagues.\n\n\"One of the advantages that we have with our setup is that there's a connection with the majority of other cricket leagues around the world,\" Banerjee, who oversaw the Hundred sale, said.\n\n\"And for all of those [T20] leagues, it makes little sense for any of us to clash if we can avoid it.\n\n\"So we are now on the same side, if you like, and we can have sensible conversations going forward. For the MLC, that includes the fact that we obviously know the new CEO there pretty well.\n\n\"But for us, it's about ensuring that we can make The Hundred a real success in our window by getting the best players, and clashes make that hard. So we'll do our best to avoid it. And I think all the people coming in understand that.\"",

        "body": "From Major League Cricket in the USA to SA20 teams in South Africa, IPL franchises have already expanded to these places. Now, England’s famous league, The Hundred, will have Indian co-owners for fifty percent of the teams, with four out of the eight teams now co-owned by franchises that also own IPL teams. Adding to this, GMR has acquired a 100% stake in Southern Brave, which means they now have full control over this The Hundred team.\n\nAmidst all this, one question on everyone’s mind is whether IPL-owned teams will avoid picking Pakistani players. This is largely due to various factors. In SA20, the league usually coincides with the PSL, while Major League Cricket does have Pakistani players, but only in teams not owned by IPL franchises. This makes the situation even more interesting.\n\nNow, with IPL team owners buying stakes in this popular tournament, will there be any restrictions or limitations on Pakistani players? The answer is already coming from England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive Richard Gould. According to ESPN Cricinfo, he clarified, “We’re aware of that in other regions, but that won’t be happening here.”\n\nWill Indian cricketers play in The Hundred?\n\nGould also opened up about the availability of Indian players. As per the BCCI, they don’t allow active Indian cricketers to play in other leagues to protect them from injury and over-exposure. The ECB chief executive spoke along similar lines but mentioned that he would be happy to see Indian players participating in such leagues.\n\n“In terms of availability to Indian players, that is not priced in with our plans. The BCCI’s position has been very clear. At some point, we’d love to see Indian players come and play in England.

        "body": "Major League Cricket’s Washington Freedom celebrate their title win in 2024\n\nThere’s a famous Pub Quiz question which asks which two teams competed in the inaugural international cricket match. Surprisingly, the answer is United States versus Canada (in 1844). So what happened to cricket in North America in the subsequent years, and how did baseball come to overtake it in popularity in that part of the world?\n\nIt is said that it was in part a victim of the US Civil War (1861 to 1865) and was by this time seen as a gentlemen’s game rather than the blue collar game which baseball was to become.\n\nOnce the Imperial Cricket Conference was formed in 1909 comprising Australia, England and South Africa it was said that the next team in the world were the Gentlemen of Philadelphia – but they were not, of course, an international team and time marched on with other countries joining what became the International Cricket Council and cricket waning in popularity in North America.\n\nWith the commencement of Twenty20 (T20) Cricket by the England and Wales Cricket Board in 2003 and the Indian Premier League in 2008, franchise competitions around the world have given opportunities for the best cricketers to be seen (and rewarded) outside their home countries.\n\nIn 2023, Major League Cricket began in the USA comprising six teams: Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom with matches held at just two venues: Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas (capacity 7,200) and Morrisville, North Carolina (capacity 3,500).\n\nWhile there are plans to build new or renovate existing venues the question remains about why, to date, cricket has never caught on sufficiently in North America especially given the huge popularity of baseball.\n\nI have always thought that had history been different, T20 cricket in particular would be an ideal product for the North American Sports market. My rationale for this is that the other main North America sports (NFL and NBA) tend to be high scoring whilst a MLB game which lasts a similar length of time to a T20 match could potentially finish 1-0, while the latter can produce over 200 runs.\n\nHowever, cricket in North America is seemingly always going to be a poor relative and competitor to baseball and additionally has the issues of all minority sports including the lack of adequate facilities, coaching, and marketing.\n\nWhere in the US children seem to grow up with a ball and glove in much the same way as UK kids do with a football – cricket equipment is expensive and the techniques are complicated in comparison with the hitting and throwing of a baseball.\n\nInterestingly, the USA have recently entered a team in the Under 19 T20 Cricket World Cup having previously participated in the 2006 and 2010 tournaments. Hopefully, any success that the team has will have a positive impact on the prospects of the game in North America and help the game to grow in popularity by complementing rather than competing with baseball.\n\nArticle by Steve Boyde.
