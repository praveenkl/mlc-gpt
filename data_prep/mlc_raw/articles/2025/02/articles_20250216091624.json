Currently, four of the eight teams in England's renowned league, The Hundred, are co-owned by franchises that also control IPL teams, meaning that half of the teams will have Indian co-owners. Furthermore, GMR now has complete control over The Hundred team after purchasing a 100% share in Southern Brave.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn the midst of all of this, everyone is wondering if IPL-owned clubs will avoid selecting Pakistani players. This is mostly caused by several factors. While Major League Cricket does feature Pakistani players, only on teams that are not owned by IPL franchises, the SA20 league typically runs concurrently with the PSL.\n\nThe ECB does not anticipate that the BCCI's policy of excluding active Indian male players from participating in overseas T20 competitions will be impacted by the inclusion of investors with ties to the Indian Premier League, even though it may open doors to the lucrative Indian market. No Indian player has played in the Hundred, even though they are often involved in county cricket. \"We're aware of that in other regions, but that won't be happening here,” Gould was quoted as saying by ESPN Cricinfo about Pakistani players being banned in The Hundred.\n\nGould promised that Pakistani cricket players will not be constrained\n\nECB Chief Executive Richard Gould made it clear that the ECB's preparations did not take into account the availability of Indian players. In addition, Gould promised that Pakistani cricket players will not be constrained by IPL influence in the Hundred. He acknowledged that, unlike the Hundred, which depends on Pakistani talent, Pakistan is not represented in IPL-related tournaments such as the ILT20 and MLC.",
