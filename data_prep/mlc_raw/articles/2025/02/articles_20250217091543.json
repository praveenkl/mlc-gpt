The player draft for the third season is scheduled for Wednesday, February 19.\n\nDefending champions Washington Freedom have retained the most players out of the six franchises, but star players like Travis Head, and Akeal Hosein are not part of the list. While Steve Smith has been retained by the side, Australia's tour of the Caribbean in the June-July window coinciding with MLC 2025, complicates his availability.\n\nRunners-up San Francisco Unicorns have also released big names like Pat Cummins, Matt Henry, and Josh Inglis, but have retained the opening pair of Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk and pace spearhead Haris Rauf.\n\nKagiso Rabada, who has been part of the MI family through the MI Cape Town and the MI New York, has been released by the latter. Apart from the pacer, the inaugural MLC winners have also parted ways with other major names like Anrich Nortje, Dewald Brevis, and Tim David.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have released star pacer Matheesha Pathirana, as well as Mitchell Santner, Naveen-ul-Haq, and Daryl Mitchell. Skipper Faf du Plessis, veteran opener Devon Conway, all-rounder Marcus Stoinis, and frontline spinner Noor Ahmad are the major names retained by the franchise.\n\nRunners-up from the first season, the Seattle Orcas plan on a major revamp after their dismal 2024 campaign. They have retained only seven players, the least among all teams, with South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen and Ryan Rickelton being among them.\n\nVeteran all-rounders Sunil Narine and Andre Russell continue to be a part of the LA Knight Riders, but major names like David Miller, Jason Roy, Shakib Al Hasan, and Adam Zampa have been released.\n\nFranchise-wise retention list for MLC 2025\n\nLA Knight Riders: Ali Khan, Adithya Ganesh, Unmukt Chand, Nitish Kumar, Corne Dry, Saif Badar, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Matthew Tromp, Spencer Johnson, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine\n\nMI New York: Ehsan Adil, Nosthush Kenjige, Monank Patel, Heath Richards, Rushil Ugarkar, Sunny Patel, Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran, Rashid Khan, Trent Boult\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Corey Anderson, Hassan Khan, Liam Plunkett, Carmi Le Roux, Brody Couch, Karima Gore, Juanoy Drysdale, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Haris Rauf, Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short\n\nSeattle Orcas: Harmeet Singh, Cameron Gannon, Ali Sheikh, Ayan Desai, Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen, Ryan Rickelton\n\nTexas Super Kings: Joshua Tromp, Calvin Savage, Milind Kumar, Mohammad Mohsin, Zia-ul-Haq, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway, Noor Ahmad, Marcus Stoinis\n\nWashington Freedom: Andries Gous, Mukhtar Ahmed, Obus Pienaar, Saurabh Netravalkar, Ian Holland, Amila Aponso, Justin Dill, Lahiru Milantha, Yasir Mohammad, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Lockie Ferguson, Rachin Ravindra, Steven Smith, Jack Edwards",

        "body": "In a move that comes as little surprise, Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has been released by the Los Angeles Knight Riders ahead of the 2025 Major League Cricket (MLC) season.\n\nShakib, now in the twilight of his career, was not among the franchise's retained players as teams finalised their squads for the upcoming campaign.\n\nThe veteran cricketer, who is currently unable to bowl due to a suspect action, featured in just four matches for the Knight Riders in the 2024 season, scoring 60 runs and taking a solitary wicket.\n\nThe franchise, co-owned by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, opted to retain only three overseas players—Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, both long-serving Knight Riders stalwarts, alongside Australian left-arm pacer Spencer Johnson.\n\nShakib is not the only high-profile player to be released, with England's Jason Roy, South Africa's David Miller, and Australia's Adam Zampa also finding themselves without a team. Even Test stars Pat Cummins (San Francisco Unicorns) and Travis Head (Washington Freedom) have been let go, though this is primarily due to their commitments with Australia's Test squad, which will face the West Indies in June—coinciding with the MLC season. Interestingly, Washington Freedom have retained Steve Smith despite his similar commitments.\n\nDespite being released, Shakib and the other players now enter the draft, set to take place on 19 February, where they will have the opportunity to be picked up by another team—or even return to their previous sides. However, given his recent form and inability to bowl, it remains uncertain whether teams will show interest in Shakib as a specialist batsman.\n\nThe 37-year-old last played competitive cricket in November 2024 in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. While he was expected to feature in India's Legend 90 League, he ultimately did not take part. His most recent appearance for Bangladesh came in October 2024 in a Test match against India.\n\nFurther complicating matters for Shakib is his political situation. Having been elected as a Member of Parliament for the then-ruling Awami League earlier in 2024, he has been unable to return to Bangladesh following the recent political upheaval. While he had hoped to bid farewell to international cricket with a home Test against South Africa in November, circumstances prevented this from materialising.\n\nAs the MLC draft approaches, the cricketing world now waits to see whether Shakib Al Hasan will secure another franchise contract—or if this marks the end of his T20 career.",
