        "title": "Will IPL Teams Owning Stakes In Hundred Impact Pakistan Players? Here's What ECB Said",
        "date": "Thu Feb 13 18:49:37 2025",
        "body": "The Hundred will now have Indian co-owners of 50% of the teams. Four of the eight teams are now co-owned by entities that also own franchises in the richest cricket league in the world, the Indian Premier League (IPL). However, they don’t only own teams in the IPL, but also in Major League Cricket (MLC), International League T20 (ILT20) and SA20.\n\nOne thing that is common between the teams owned by IPL wonders in all three leagues is that they don’t sign players from Pakistan. Pakistani players have not been part of the IPL since the inaugural season in 2008. SA20 coincides with the Pakistan Super League (PSL) and ILT20 and MLC have other teams that are owned by non-IPL owners as well. So some Pakistani players get to be a part of those leagues.\n\nSo what will happen to The Hundred teams? Will there also be a practice of IPL co-owned teams not picking Pakistani players? The answer to that so far is NO, as per England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Richard Gould.\n\n\"We're aware of that in other regions, but that won't be happening here,” Gould was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo about Pakistani players being banned in The Hundred.\n\nHere are the IPL team owners who own some stakes in The Hundred:\n\nRPSG Group (owners of Lucknow Super Giants) have a stake in Manchester Originals\n\nSun TV Network Limited (Sunrisers Hyderabad) own the Northern Superchargers\n\nReliance Industries Limited (Mumbai Indians) have claimed a stake in Oval Invincibles\n\nGMR Group (co-owners of Delhi Capitals) have a stake in Hampshire, which own the Southern Brave, respectively.",
        "summary": "The article mentions that four teams in The Hundred, a cricket tournament, are now co-owned by entities that also own franchises in the Indian Premier League (IPL), Major League Cricket (MLC), International League T20 (ILT20), and SA20. Notably, these IPL-owned teams do not sign players from Pakistan in other leagues. However, according to England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Richard Gould, this practice will not be followed in The Hundred, and Pakistani players will not be banned.\n\nRegarding MLC specifically, the article highlights that IPL team owners such as RPSG Group, Sun TV Network Limited, Reliance Industries Limited, and GMR Group have stakes in teams in The Hundred, but it does not mention any specific information about their involvement in MLC."

        "date": "",
        "body": "Indian-American entrepreneur, Sanjay Govil has secured a 50 percent stake in Welsh Fire, the Cardiff-based franchise in The Hundred, a professional cricket league in the United Kingdom.\n\nOwner of the Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise, Washington Freedom and founder of Infinite Computer Solutions and Zyter TruCare, Govil’s successful bid marks his interest in the expanding market of recreational cricket.\n\n“I’m thrilled for this next step forward in renewing and expanding cricket for the next generation of fans,” Govil said. “I’m looking forward to the benefits our partnership will have not only for recreational cricket in the United Kingdom but for strengthening the cross-border relationship between international teams, franchises, and fans for years to come.”\n\nGlamorgan County Cricket Club, the host county of Welsh Fire, welcomed the investment. Chair Mark Rhydderch-Roberts said, “It was vitally important for us that any investment partner shared our values, our strategic and commercial aims, and our ambition to grow as an international brand. Washington Freedom ticked all of the boxes and has been our preferred bidder for some time, so we are delighted that they have chosen to partner with us.”\n\nGovil's involvement in cricket began with the Washington Freedom, which he launched during Major League Cricket's inaugural season in 2023. Under the coaching of former Australian captain Ricky Ponting and leadership of current Australian batter Steve Smith, the team clinched the MLC championship in 2024."
