        "body": "Australian cricket captain and player with Midas touch Pat Cummins who recently pulled out from Champions Trophy 2025 due to ankle injury has decided to sit out of the 2025 season of Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States. The 31-year-old fast bowler signed a four-year contract with the San Francisco Unicorns in June 2023. He had a great performance in 2024 powering Unicorns to Top 2. He cited international commitments and workload management as the primary reasons for his absence in the league's 2025 season.\n\nCummins’ MLC Journey So Far\n\nCummins made his MLC debut in the 2024 season, playing six matches for the San Francisco Unicorns. Despite his good performance across the leagues he had a modest performance, taking four wickets at an average of 52.75. His decision to skip the 2025 season comes as he focuses on recovering from an ankle injury and managing his busy international schedule.\n\nIn a statement, the San Francisco Unicorns confirmed Cummins’ unavailability for the upcoming season. “Pat Cummins is unavailable to re-sign for the Unicorns in 2025 due to international commitments and workload management,” the statement read. “The fast bowler has expressed his excitement to play in future Major League Cricket seasons, as his international schedule permits.”\n\nInternational Commitments Take Priority\n\nFollowing the tournament in Pakistan, Australia’s next major assignment is the World Test Championship final at Lord’s, starting on June 11, 2025. The team will then travel to the Caribbean for a series of three Tests and five T20 internationals against the West Indies in June and July. This schedule directly clashes with the third edition of MLC, making it impossible for Cummins to participate.\n\nWhat’s Next for Cummins and MLC?\n\nWhile Cummins will miss the 2025 MLC season, his commitment to the San Francisco Unicorns remains intact. His four-year contract runs until 2027, leaving the door open for future appearances in the tournament.",

The event, scheduled to take place on February 19, has already seen some surprising decisions from franchises like MI New York, Texas Super Kings, and Seattle Orcas.\n\nSeattle Orcas Release High-Profile Players\n\nSeattle Orcas have raised eyebrows by releasing several high-profile former internationals, including Shehan Jayasuriya, Nauman Anwar, and Hammad Azam. Jayasuriya, in particular, may have requested an early release due to being benched last season over fitness concerns. The Orcas enter the draft with the highest remaining purse of USD 180,000, giving them flexibility in making new acquisitions.\n\nMI New York Parts Ways with Steven Taylor\n\nMI New York has made a bold move by parting ways with their first-ever draft pick, Steven Taylor. The franchise took a chance on Taylor’s T20 potential, but after two disappointing seasons, they decided to move in a different direction. This decision opens up opportunities for new talent to join the team during the draft.\n\nNotable Omissions in Domestic Player Retention Lists\n\nOther notable omissions include star all-rounder Shubham Ranjane, who was underutilized by the Orcas and is now expected to be a top pick in the draft. Additionally, USA wicketkeeper-batsman Shayan Jahangir faces uncertainty after not being retained, alongside MI’s top pick Ruben Clinton, who was released following a series of poor performances.\n\nHigh-Stakes Draft for Some Teams\n\nTeams like Washington Freedom, Los Angeles Knight Riders, and San Francisco Unicorns have opted to retain most of their domestic players, with limited funds remaining for the draft. However, MI New York, Texas Super Kings, and Seattle Orcas are poised for a high-stakes draft as they rebuild their squads. With significant roster changes, these teams have the opportunity to make strategic picks to strengthen their lineups for the upcoming season.\n\nOverall, the domestic player retention lists reveal the competitive nature of Major League Cricket as teams make bold decisions to enhance their chances of success in the league. Fans can look forward to an exciting draft as new talent joins established players in shaping the future of cricket in the United States.\n\nNew Talent Emerging in Major League Cricket\n\nAs Major League Cricket teams prepare for the upcoming domestic player draft, there is a buzz surrounding the emergence of new talent in the league. With established players being released or not retained by their teams, this draft presents a unique opportunity for young, up-and-coming cricketers to showcase their skills and make a mark on the league.\n\nOne player generating significant interest is 21-year-old all-rounder Ananya Agarwal, who has been making waves in the domestic circuit with impressive performances. Agarwal’s potential has caught the attention of several franchises looking to strengthen their squads with versatile players. The draft could be a pivotal moment for Agarwal as he aims to secure a spot in a Major League Cricket team and prove himself on a bigger stage.\n\nStrategic Moves to Build Competitive Teams\n\nWith teams like MI New York, Texas Super Kings, and Seattle Orcas making bold decisions to revamp their domestic rosters, the draft is shaping up to be a strategic battleground. Franchises are not only looking to fill gaps in their squads but also aiming to create a competitive edge by selecting players who can deliver consistent performances throughout the season.\n\nFor MI New York, the departure of Steven Taylor opens up a slot for a new player who could bring a fresh dynamic to the team. With a strong focus on T20 potential, the franchise is likely to target players who can excel in high-pressure situations and contribute to their overall success in the league.\n\nOpportunities for Underrated Players\n\nAs the draft approaches, there is a sense of anticipation among underrated players who may have been overlooked in previous seasons. With established names being released or not retained, there is an opportunity for lesser-known cricketers to step up and make a name for themselves in Major League Cricket.\n\nPlayers like left-arm spinner Maya Patel and hard-hitting batsman Vikram Singh, who have been performing consistently in domestic competitions, are hopeful of catching the eye of scouts during the draft. These players bring a unique skill set to the table and could be valuable assets to teams looking to add depth to their squads.\n\nBuilding a Strong Foundation for the Future\n\nAs Major League Cricket teams navigate the complexities of the domestic player draft, they are not only focused on the immediate season but also on building a strong foundation for the future. The decisions made during this draft could have long-term implications for the competitiveness and sustainability of the league as a whole.\n\nBy investing in promising young talent, fostering a culture of excellence, and creating opportunities for players to grow and develop, Major League Cricket is laying the groundwork for a thriving cricket ecosystem in the United States. The upcoming draft represents a crucial step in this journey towards establishing cricket as a mainstream sport in the country.\n\nOverall, the anticipation surrounding the domestic player draft in Major League Cricket reflects the league’s commitment to innovation, talent development, and creating an exciting platform for cricket enthusiasts in the United States. As teams make bold moves and strategic decisions, fans can expect a season filled with intense competition, emerging stars, and thrilling cricket action.",

The explosive England batsman has decided to skip the T20 Blast and The Hundred this summer, instead signing with the Knight Riders franchise. The 36-year-old will represent the team in Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA and the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) in the West Indies.\n\nSince retiring from international cricket in 2023, Hales has been traveling the world playing in various franchise leagues. Earlier this year, he featured in six matches for Rangpur Riders in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) before moving on to the ILT20 in the UAE. During the tournament, he surpassed Kieron Pollard to become the second-highest run-scorer in T20 history.\n\nHales now has 13,610 T20 runs, needing just 953 more to overtake Chris Gayle at the top of the all-time charts.\n\nAs part of his career reshuffle, Hales is cutting ties with Nottinghamshire, a club he has been an integral part of since 2008. Having recently settled in Dubai with his family, he has no plans to return to England for the summer.\n\nThe Knight Riders franchise operates in four major T20 leagues—Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the ILT20, Los Angeles Knight Riders in MLC, and Trinbago Knight Riders in the CPL. Like Andre Russell and Sunil Narine, who regularly feature in multiple leagues for the franchise, Hales is now set to follow the same path.\n\nLast year, Hales skipped six of Nottinghamshire’s 14 T20 Blast matches to play in the Lanka Premier League. He could once again feature in the Sri Lankan tournament this year, depending on scheduling, or he might opt to play in the newly launched European T20 Premier League, which will be held in Ireland, Scotland, and the Netherlands.\n\nFollowing Hales’ decision to prioritize overseas leagues, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has tightened its rules regarding No Objection Certificates (NOCs). This has led Hales to fully commit to playing abroad for the upcoming season.\n\nHales isn’t alone in making such a move—James Vince has also stepped away from red-ball cricket to focus on franchise leagues, while Jason Roy previously left his ECB central contract to play in the MLC.\n\nDespite his departure, Hales has expressed his desire to return to Nottinghamshire in the future. The club’s Director of Cricket, Mick Newell, has assured that the doors will always be open for him.",

Notably, Australia’s Travis Head and Pat Cummins, along with South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada and David Miller, are among those not retained for the upcoming season.\n\nMany of the international retention decisions are based on national team conflicts, which are numerous this year. In 2024, the MLC took place in July immediately following the Men’s T20 World Cup, and thus faced virtually no international conflicts.\n\nThe 2025 edition, anticipated to be from mid-June to mid July conflicts with both the World Test Championship final between Australia and South Africa on June 11-15, as well as the Australia tour of the West Indies from June 25-July 28.\n\nWhile many of the player cuts are due to these scheduling reasons, the changes will still alter the face of the league.\n\nLA Knight Riders have retained three overseas veterans: Sunil Narine, who took five wickets; Andre Russell, who contributed 129 runs and two wickets in six matches; and Australian pacer Spencer Johnson, who claimed nine wickets in six games. Meanwhile, the franchise released South African David Miller, who scored 81 runs in six games, Englishman Jason Roy with 163 runs in six matches, Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan, who added 60 runs and one wicket in four games, and Australian Adam Zampa.\n\nMI New York, the inaugural champions, have held onto West Indies legend Kieron Pollard, who recorded 63 runs and five wickets in five matches, along with Trent Boult, who took nine wickets in seven matches, Nicholas Pooran with 180 runs in seven matches, and Rashid Khan, who contributed 162 runs and ten wickets in seven matches. However, they have released South Africans Anrich Nortje, who managed one wicket in two matches, and Kagiso Rabada, along with power-hitter Dewald Brevis with 85 runs in four matches. They also cut Australian Tim David.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns, runners-up in the 2024 season, have chosen to retain key players such as openers Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk. However, they released Pat Cummins, fellow Australian Josh Inglis, who scored 157 runs across nine matches, and NZ star Matt Henry.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas retained seven players, including South African stars Ryan Rickelton Heinrich Klaasen, despite Klaasen’s modest tally of 97 runs in six matches last season. Conversely, prominent players like Quinton de Kock, who amassed 170 runs in seven games, Michael Bracewell, Obed McCoy, and Nandre Burger, who secured four wickets last season, have been released.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings (TSK) retained captain Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway, who scored 420 and 293 runs in eight innings respectively. They have also kept Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis, who contributed 83 runs and seven wickets in seven matches, and Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad. Released players include New Zealand’s Mitchell Santner, who took two wickets in two matches, Matheesha Pathirana, Daryl Mitchell, and Afghanistan’s Naveen-ul-Haq.\n\nDefending champions Washington Freedom have opted to retain 15 players, the highest number among all teams. Travis Head was not retained, while 2024 Captain Steve Smith was retained – both were tied the team’s 2024 top run-scorers with 336 runs each.

        "title": "Hales to Miss T20 Blast and Hundred",
        "date": "Tue Feb 18 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "Alex Hales is poised to forgo participation in both the T20 Blast and the Hundred cricket tournaments following his recent contract with the Knight Riders franchises. This agreement will see him compete in Major League Cricket and the Caribbean Premier League. Hales, who is 36 years old, stepped away from international cricket in 2023 but has remained active in the franchise circuit globally. Notably, he achieved the milestone of becoming the second-highest run-scorer in T20 history earlier this month.\n\nHaving been a part of Nottinghamshire since 2008, Hales has chosen to relocate to Dubai. Consequently, he will miss the upcoming season with Nottinghamshire, opting not to renew his contract. This decision marks a significant pause in Hales' long-standing affiliation with Trent Bridge, though he has expressed a desire to potentially return in the future. Hales has made significant contributions at this venue throughout his professional cricket career, standing as the leading run-scorer for both Nottinghamshire in the T20 Blast and the Trent Rockets in the Hundred, with championship titles to his credit.\n\nLast season, Hales faced a scheduling conflict, as he missed six matches of Nottinghamshire's 14-group fixtures in the T20 Blast while fulfilling obligations with the Lanka Premier League. In the wake of this, the England and Wales Cricket Board has enacted stricter regulations regarding No-Objection Certificates, making it unlikely that playing for Nottinghamshire or the Trent Rockets would be feasible without hindering his ability to compete abroad during the English cricket season.\n\nRecent information from ESPNcricinfo indicates that Hales will take advantage of the opportunity presented by the Knight Riders franchise. In the upcoming tournaments, he will represent the Knight Riders teams in Los Angeles for Major League Cricket and in Trinidad for the Caribbean Premier League. Depending on the scheduling details, he might also consider returning to the Lanka Premier League between these events or potentially participate in the new European T20 Premier League which encompasses matches in Ireland, Scotland, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Knight Riders franchise operates teams across four locations: Los Angeles, Trinbago, Kolkata, and Abu Dhabi. Numerous players have found success across these territories, with Sunil Narine and Andre Russell featuring prominently. Venky Mysore, the franchise's chief executive, has previously remarked that year-round contracts with an Indian Premier League team would be optimal for players. Hales’ recent move could signify progress towards that goal.\n\nReflecting on his time at Trent Bridge, Hales articulated that his 17-year journey with Nottinghamshire has been immensely rewarding. He emphasized that the venue remains his top choice for playing cricket. He fondly recalled the cherished memories created while wearing the Nottinghamshire jersey and noted the solid friendships he forged within the team environment. While acknowledging the changes in the cricket landscape and the relocation that he undertook recently, he expressed disappointment at not being able to play at Trent Bridge this season but expressed hope for a return in the future.\n\nMick Newell, the director of cricket at Nottinghamshire, conveyed an open invitation for Hales to rejoin the team whenever his commitments allow. He emphasized that although Hales will not participate this summer, the door remains open for future opportunities, particularly given Hales' tremendous contributions and lasting legacy at Trent Bridge.\n\nThe changing dynamics of Hales' personal life, including his recent marriage to his South African fiancée and his move abroad, necessitate adjustments in how players manage their careers. He is set to become the second English player to compete in Major League Cricket, following Jason Roy. Roy had terminated his ECB incremental contract early to participate in the inaugural season of the league and has also represented the Knight Riders in subsequent years, though he is not on the squad for the 2025 season while planning to play for Surrey during the T20 Blast.\n\nIn order for Hales to compete internationally, he is required to secure a No Objection Letter from the ECB, however, he anticipates no significant challenges in obtaining this, despite recent changes in ECB policy. Richard Gould, the chief executive of the ECB, has made it clear that players who opt not to hold county contracts and prefer to explore global opportunities as freelance players are free to do so. These developments have sparked conversations regarding player choices, as seen in James Vince’s decision to depart from first-class cricket in favour of participating in the Pakistan Super League, a change echoed by Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who is also negotiating his contract with Somerset in light of his PSL involvement.\n\nIn sum, Hales’ latest career move reflects not just individual choice but broader trends in the professional cricket landscape, indicating a shift towards a more global and flexible approach in scheduling and participation in the sport.\n\nWhat you should read next:",
        "summary": "Alex Hales, a 36-year-old cricketer, has signed a contract with the Knight Riders franchises, which will see him compete in Major League Cricket (MLC) and the Caribbean Premier League. He will play for the Los Angeles Knight Riders team in MLC. This decision comes after he opted not to renew his contract with Nottinghamshire, marking a pause in his 17-year affiliation with Trent Bridge. Hales is set to become the second English player to participate in MLC, following Jason Roy. He anticipates no significant challenges in obtaining a No Objection Letter from the ECB to compete internationally.
