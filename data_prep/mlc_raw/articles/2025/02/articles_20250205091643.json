        "title": "Cricket-No plans to own teams in other T20 leagues, says RCB COO",
        "date": "Tue Feb  4 17:15:04 2025",
        "body": "Other IPL teams such as the Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and Kolkata Knight Riders own three or more teams in three different countries.\n\nThey include franchises in South Africa (SA20), the West Indies (Caribbean Premier League), the U.S. (Major League Cricket) and the United Arab Emirates (International League T20), but Menon said RCB have different ideas about expansion.\n\n“Expanding the brand globally doesn’t mean only by participating in cricket,” Menon told Reuters.\n\n“We can expand our merchandise range to Australia, the U.S., and the U.K. through our bar and cafe, not just sports.\n\n“Currently, we are not expanding RCB from a sporting point of view but we will expand RCB through other expansions.”\n\nRCB did, however, acquire the Bengaluru franchise in the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in 2023 at the reported bidding amount of just over $100 million.\n\nThey splurged nearly $415,000 to sign Indian batter Smriti Mandhana — the most expensive buy in WPL history — and it paid rich dividends as she captained RCB to the WPL title last year.\n\nBut the men’s team have yet to lift a trophy in the IPL despite reaching the playoffs four times in the last five years.\n\n“The more number of times you reach the playoffs, the probability of winning the championship is quite near,” Menon said.\n\n“I don’t think it’s far that we win because all the signs are there and the WPL team winning (the title) is also one sign.”\n\nDespite having heavy hitters such as Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis over the years, the title has eluded the Bengaluru franchise, who have been beaten in the final three times — in 2009, 2011 and 2016.\n\n“Icons are critical and that is what we have created in our RCB franchise,” Menon said.\n\n“Chris Gayle’s 175 not out is still not broken… the most IPL runs record by an individual is still with Kohli (8,004 runs), the highest partnership is with Kohli and De Villiers (229 in 2016), so we have manifested the philosophy.\n\n“When you play bold, there can be negatives too. The lowest score is with RCB (49 v Kolkata in 2017), so that is where we resonate with young India… There are young Indians that want to do multiple things but there is fear of failure.”\n\nRCB rejigged their squad in the 2025 auction, retaining only Kohli, Rajat Patidar and Yash Dayal.\n\nBut they recruited big hitters Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt while also bringing in pacers Josh Hazlewood and Bhuvneshwar Kumar to freshen up the squad.\n\n“If you look at our supporting staff, it’s also strong with (coach) Andy Flower and (director of cricket) Mo Bobat,” Menon added.\n\n“They have come in and they have looked at this entire franchise with a fresh pair of eyes… We have a good team to go, so let’s see.”\n\n(Reporting by Suramya Kaushik in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar)\n\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

        "title": "Welsh Fire franchise acquired by Washington Freedom owners for £67.5 million",
        "date": "Mon Feb  3 09:01:07 2025",
        "body": "The owners of Major League Cricket franchise Washington Freedom, led by Indian-American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil, have secured a 49% stake in the Welsh Fire franchise for £33 million. This deal, which took place during the second round of team sales in The Hundred, values Welsh Fire at £67.5 million.\n\nGovil’s bid was the highest of two sealed bids for the Cardiff-based franchise. The process was delayed due to intense competition, particularly for the London Spirit team. Govil’s successful bid outpaced those from Capri International, owners of UP Warriorz and Sharjah Warriors, as well as Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, who expressed interest but did not formalize a bid after initial talks last year.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) continues to control The Hundred but has been selling stakes in teams to generate funds for cricket. The eight hosts of the teams will maintain a 51% stake in their respective franchises, while the ECB has been selling the remaining 49%. To date, the ECB has raised £278 million through the sale of these stakes.\n\nGovil, who is the chairman of U.S.-based tech companies Infinite Computer Solutions and Zyter, entered the cricket world two years ago with the acquisition of Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket, which won the title in its second season. As part of his new venture, he will now enter an eight-week exclusivity period with Glamorgan, which holds the remaining 51% stake in Welsh Fire.\n\nThe revenue from these sales will support the 18 first-class counties, the MCC, and grassroots cricket, securing the long-term stability of county cricket for the next two decades. If a host chooses to sell part or all of their stake, 10% of the proceeds will go to the first-class counties and the MCC, alongside the funds from the ECB’s stake sales.\n\nThe teams in The Hundred, each of which has a men’s and women’s team, are based in various iconic stadiums, including Lord’s, The Oval, Southampton, Cardiff, Trent Bridge, Edgbaston, Old Trafford, and Headingley.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nStay ahead of the latest cricket industry trends by subscribing to our free cricexec “daily briefing” newsletter.",
