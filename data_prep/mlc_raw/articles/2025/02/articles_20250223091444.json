        "body": "As a rare gap emerged in their international schedule last year, a slew of star Australians quickly signed up for the well-heeled and much-hyped Major League Cricket - the T20 franchise tournament hoped to spur cricket's popularity in the U.S.\n\nThe most high-profile recruit was Australia Test captain and superstar bowler Pat Cummins, who signed a four-year deal to play for San Francisco Unicorns. He subsequently played six matches last season for modest returns, but his presence added significant credibility to the fledgling tournament.\n\nBut more congested fixturing has emerged for Australia in the middle part of the year as they look to defend their World Test Championship title against South Africa in London in June before touring the Caribbean.\n\n\"Pat Cummins is unavailable to re-sign for the Unicorns in 2025 due to international commitments and workload management,\" the Unicorns said in a statement. \"The fast bowler has expressed his excitement to play in future Major League Cricket seasons, as his international schedule permits.\"\n\nCummins' Australian teammate Travis Head, the moustached World Cup hero, will also not be part of the tournament after being released by Washington Freedom. South Africans Kagiso Rabada and David Miller are also among the big names that will be missing, while Steven Smith has been retained by Freedom although his availability is doubtful given his international commitments.\n\nThere will still be considerable star power with Heinrich Klaasen, Andre Russell and Nicholas Pooran among top players set to be part of the tournament. Further overseas signings will be announced soon, MLC says.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige, who starred for U.S. in their remarkable victory over Oman recently, will again line up for MI New York, while Unmukt Chand, Cameron Gannon and Brody Couch are among the headline American players who have been retained.\n\nA pivotal third season looms for MLC as it starts to cement its standing in world cricket while infiltrating the saturated but lucrative American sports market. More than $100 million has been invested in the MLC by influential Indian businessmen, some of whom are ensconced in Silicon Valley.\n\nFinancial expectations were surpassed in its first season before backing up last year with the MLC going in the \"right direction\".\n\nBut there will be change. MLC has a new chief executive with Johnny Grave, the respected former West Indies boss, taking over from Vijay Srinivasan, who is spearheading one of two new franchises set to come in for the 2027 season.\n\nInfrastructure has been slow to develop which isn't surprising given the unique dimensions of a cricket ground. MLC has primarily been played in Dallas, with its former baseball stadium in Grand Prairie becoming the hub of cricket in the U.S.\n\nTexas is the only franchise with a home ground, with San Francisco, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Seattle and MI New York all still trying to find permanent facilities. However, there is hope that the Unicorns will be based at the iconic Coliseum in Oakland where the Athletics called home for 57 years.\n\nForbesCricket Could Be Played At Oakland Coliseum As Los Angeles Olympics Looms\n\nCricket might start being played at the Coliseum as soon as this upcoming season, which will help ignite MLC starting a little earlier this year in June and without several drawcards.",
        "summary": "**Player Updates**\n\n* Pat Cummins, Australia's Test captain, will not be playing for San Francisco Unicorns in 2025 due to international commitments, but has expressed interest in playing in future seasons.\n* Travis Head, Kagiso Rabada, and David Miller will also not be participating in the tournament.\n* Steven Smith has been retained by Washington Freedom, but his availability is doubtful due to international commitments.\n* Heinrich Klaasen, Andre Russell, and Nicholas Pooran are among the top players set to participate in the tournament.\n\n**Tournament Update**\n\n* The MLC will start in June 2023, earlier than previous seasons.\n* The tournament has invested over $100 million from influential Indian businessmen.\n* The MLC has a new chief executive, Johnny Grave, who replaced Vijay Srinivasan.\n* Two new franchises are set to be introduced in the 2027 season.\n\n**Infrastructure Update**\n\n* The tournament has primarily been played in Dallas, with Grand Prairie being the hub of cricket in the US.\n* Most franchises, including San Francisco, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Seattle, and MI New York, are still searching for permanent facilities.\n* There is a possibility that the San Francisco Unicorns may play at the iconic Oakland Coliseum this season."

        "date": "Sun Feb 23 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) domestic players draft for the upcoming season saw some exciting picks, with Agni Chopra, son of renowned Bollywood director Vidhu Vinod Chopra, emerging as the number one draft pick for MI New York. The 26-year-old opening batter, known for his stellar performances in Indian domestic cricket, was signed for $50,000. Meanwhile, USA fast bowler Jasdeep Singh completed a remarkable redemption story by becoming the top pick for Seattle Orcas at $75,000.\n\nThe agitating picks thus far had been seen at the MLC domestic players' drafts for another season, where Agni Chopra, son of famous Bollywood director Vidhu Vinod Chopra, became the prime pick for MI New York. The opening batter of 26, considered an absolute gem in domestic cricket, was bought for 50,000 dollars. Meanwhile, USA fast bowler Jasdeep Singh saw an end to his redemption story when he was named the top pick for Seattle Orcas at 75,000 dollars.\n\nAgni Chopra: From Ranji Stardom to MLC\n\nAgni Chopra's cricketing journey made for quite an extraordinary one. The left-handed batter saw fame during the 2023-24 Ranji Trophy season, having scored four consecutive centuries in his first four games. His extraordinary form continued in the 2024-25 season, where he scored 1,804 runs for Mizoram at a jaw-dropping average of 94.94. His outstanding performances had him awarded the Madhavrao Scindia Award for being the top run-scorer in the Ranji Trophy Plate League.\n\nRaised in Detroit, Michigan, Agni has US citizenship, therefore qualifying him under the MLC as a domestic player. In light of foreign passport holders now being barred by the Board of Control for Cricket in India-in anyone's imagination to play in Ranji Trophy venues-likely made Chopra opt for the USA to pursue his career in cricket. While he was successful in India, moving to MI New York is a new chapter for Agni-and unfortunately a sacrificed chance of making it to the Indian international side.\n\nJasdeep Singh: A Redemption Story\n\nThe most inspirational storyline out of the draft is for the 32-year-old USA fast bowler, Jasdeep Singh. After being undrafted in 2024, Jasdeep was presented as a supplementary pick for MI New York in 2023 before pulling-off a phenomenal comeback as a replacement for Washington Freedom in the middle of the tournament. Incredibly, his Player of the Match performances, back-to-back, in the only two games he played earned the team the crown. Seattle Orcas picked him up as their top pick for 75,000 dollars.\n\nOther Notable Picks in The Draft\n\nIn the MLC draft, other players roped in by big-money contracts include:\n\nTexas Super Kings showed interest in the fast-bowling all-rounder Shubham Ranjane, who was picked for 75,000 dollars. Ranjane was a prime candidate due to his twin abilities of hitting hard and seam bowling. The franchise also rewarded young left-arm seamer Stephen Wiig with a 15,000-dollar contract for his consistent performances in Minor League Cricket.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas went for experience in 35-year-old Sujit Nayak for 40,000 dollars. He is highly experienced, having represented Mumbai Indians and Delhi Daredevils in the IPL. The Orcas also signed Steven Taylor (25,000 dollars) and Shayan Jahangir (20,000 dollars), who are present USA players.\n\nMI New York strengthened their batting might through Tajinder Singh Dhillon ($50,000) and Sharad Lumba ($15,000), both of whom are ex-Mumbai Indians players. The franchise also signed hard-hitting left-handed batsman Kunwarjit Singh for $20,000.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders and Washington Freedom made purposeful pickups in signing left-arm-spinner Kartik Gattepalli for $15,000 and reserving left-arm seamer Abhishek Paradkar for $10,000.\n\n- San Francisco Unicorns picked up former Pakistan international Hammad Azam in the 10,000-dollar final round.\n\nHowever, some notable players were overlooked, like former Sri Lanka international Shehan Jayasuriya and former West Indies opener John Campbell, who is in the process of obtaining US citizenship.",

        "body": "Agni Chopra, son of one of the popular directors as well as producer in the Bollywood industry, Vishnu Vinod Chopra has been picked as first domestic player in MLC draft by MI New York.\n\nAccording to the recent reports from Cricbuzz, the 26-year-old cricketer was roped by the franchise for a sum of $50,000 ahead of Major League Cricket (MLC) domestic players draft.\n\nAgni Chopra caught the spotlight with his stellar performance in the first class games, scoring 4 centuries in 4 games, creating a record in the Ranji Season 2023-24.\n\nHe represented Mizoram in the 2024-25 season, where he went on to amass 1804 runs that he played at an amazing average of 94.94 with the help of 5 fifties and 9 hundreds to his name.\n\nMoreover, his citizenship in the United States of America (USA) by his birth in Detroit, Michigan, helped him to get qualified for Major League Cricket. His decision of representing USA has been understood by CricTips as Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) doesn’t allow foreign passport players playing in Ranji Trophy.\n\nAlso, BCCI will not allow the Indian cricketers to play in the foreign leagues before announcing their retirement. Therefore, it is clear that Agni Chopra will not represent the Indian cricket team in the international circuit. We can expect the 26-year-old cricketer to play across the foreign leagues.\n\nHowever, the defending champions, MI New York has also drafted the likes of Tajinder Singh Dhillon ($50,000) alongside Sharad Lumba ($15,000) ahead of the MLC domestic players draft.\n\nThe left-handed cricketer is expected to play a key role for MI New York. Having a look at his T20 stats, the opening batter has played 14 matches and scored 439 runs that he played at an average of 33.76 with the strike-rate hovering around 140.",
