Pooran and Pollard have both been retained by MI New York while Russell and Narine will once again suit up for the LA Knight Riders.\n\nMI New York and the Knight Riders finished fourth and fifth, respectively, in last year’s standings before MI New York were beaten handily by the Texas Super Kings in the eliminator.\n\nPooran will be looking to bounce back from a lean run of form by his extremely high standards in last year’s edition. He scored 180 runs in seven innings at an average of 30 and a strike rate of 125 with just one fifty.\n\nHe will hope to rediscover his form from the inaugural edition where he managed 388 runs in eight games at an average of 64.66 and a strike rate of 167.24 including a hundred and two fifties. That season also saw MI New York defeat the Seattle Orcas to be crowned the first MLC champions.\n\nPollard also had a tough time of it in 2024, making just 63 runs in seven innings at an average of 12.60 but his experience will be key in his side’s quest to win their second title.\n\nRussell’s 2024 season was also underwhelming, making 129 runs and picking up just two wickets in his six contests but everyone around the world knows his capabilities as a genuine match-winner in the format.\n\nNarine had a torrid time with the bat last season, scoring 80 runs in 11 innings at an average of 4.50. He was better with the ball, taking five wickets at an economy of 6.20 in six innings.\n\nAkeal Hosein, who took two wickets in three games for defending champions, the Washington Freedom, has been released meaning he will be available to any team in the draft set for February 19."

Following in his footsteps, Hales is all set to become the second player from England to play a part in the Major League Cricket.\n\nHowever, Roy, who played in both the previous seasons for the Knight Riders, has not been retained so far by the franchise. There are more chances that he will play for Surrey in the T20 Blast.\n\nDespite not featuring in any English county match this season, Hales will still require a no-objection certificate letter from the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to participate in any overseas competition worldwide.",

He has played for Nottinghamshire since 2008 but has recently relocated to Dubai and will not return to the club this summer after opting not to sign a new contract.\n\nThe decision will put Hales' long-term association with Trent Bridge on hold, though he has not ruled out a future return. He has called the venue home throughout his professional career and is the leading run-scorer for both Notts (in the Blast) and Trent Rockets (in the Hundred), winning titles with both teams.\n\nLast year, Hales missed six of Nottinghamshire's 14 group games in the Blast to fulfil a contract at the Lanka Premier League but the ECB has since tightened regulations on No-Objection Certificates (NOCs). As a result, signing a contract with either Notts or Trent Rockets would likely have rendered Hales unable to play overseas throughout the English season.\n\nRelated\n\nLure of MLC could see English players skip T20 Blast for US payday\n\nAlex Hales to miss Notts Blast fixtures after signing LPL deal\n\nJames Vince: Why I quit red-ball cricket - and others will follow\n\nESPNcricinfo has learned that he will instead take up an offer from the Knight Riders franchise, which will see him play for their Los Angeles and Trinbago teams in MLC and the CPL respectively. Depending on final dates, he may also return to the LPL in between the two tournaments, or alternatively feature in the new European T20 Premier League in Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands.\n\nKnight Riders own four teams around the world - Los Angeles, Trinbago, Kolkata and Abu Dhabi - and several players have represented them in two or more territories, including Sunil Narine and Andre Russell. Venky Mysore, their chief executive, has previously suggested that players signing year-round contracts with an IPL franchise would be \"nirvana\" and Hales' move appears to be another step towards that.\n\n\"The last 17 years playing at Trent Bridge for Notts have been an absolute pleasure, and it remains my favourite place in the world to play cricket,\" Hales said in a statement. \"Some of my best memories have come in a Notts shirt, and some of my closest friendships in the game have been made in that home dressing room.\n\n\"Having spent more and more time playing around the world in recent years, heading back to Trent Bridge has always been something I've looked forward to. But given the current landscape of the global game as well as having recently moved abroad, unfortunately I won't be able to return this season… Hopefully I will be able to return at some point in the future.\"\n\nMick Newell, Notts' director of cricket, said that Hales would be welcome to return to the club if his schedule allows in future. \"While he won't be joining us this summer, we are by no means closing the door on him making a return to Notts at some stage in the future, and his achievements mean he will forever have a place in Trent Bridge history,\" Newell said.\n\n\"Both his life and the global cricketing landscape have changed immeasurably since he made his debut 17 years ago. We appreciate the challenge he has faced in balancing his personal life, having recently married his South African fiancée and moved abroad, with the opportunities that a player of his calibre earns across the globe.\"\n\nHales will become the second Englishman to feature in MLC after Jason Roy, who terminated his ECB incremental deal early in order to play in the first season. Roy featured for Knight Riders again last year but has not been retained for 2025, and is likely to play for Surrey throughout the Blast season.\n\nHe will still require a \"No Objection Letter\" from the ECB to play overseas but is not anticipating any issues, despite recent changes in the board's policy. Richard Gould, the ECB's chief executive, told talkSPORT in December: \"If [players] choose not to have a contract with a county and they want to be a complete global freelancer, that's fine.\"\n\nThe changes - which Gould said are designed to \"defend our game\" from the threat of franchise cricket - played a role in James Vince's decision to quit first-class cricket this season in favour of the Pakistan Super League. Tom Kohler-Cadmore will also play in the PSL, and has therefore been renegotiating his Somerset contract accordingly.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",
