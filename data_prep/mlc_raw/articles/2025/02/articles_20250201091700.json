        "body": "A consortium of tech billionaires has agreed a huge fee of £145m for a stake in London Spirit and with it the chance to form a partnership with the prestigious Lord's ground.\n\nThe consortium - led by Nikesh Arora the chief executive of Palo Alto Networks - has agreed the deal for 49% of Spirit, meaning the whole franchise was valued at around £300m.\n\nIn Friday's second auction, the owners of Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise Washington Freedom agreed a deal to buy a stake in Welsh Fire.\n\nFreedom are backed by Indian-American IT entrepreneur Sanjay Govil and tabled a winning bid of around £80m to potentially secure a 49% share of Fire worth £40m.\n\nThe winning bidders for Spirit are thought to have beaten off competition from the Glazer family, co-owners of Manchester United, Todd Boehly, a shareholder in Chelsea, and Indian Premier League side Lucknow Super Giants.\n\nThe fee demonstrates the lure of Spirit's base Lord's, the home of cricket.\n\nInternally, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had valued all eight Hundred teams combined at a minimum of £350m.\n\nMarylebone Cricket Club (MCC), owners of Lord's, opted to keep all of the 51% share it was gifted by the ECB, while county club Glamorgan told their members last month they were planning to retain their 51% of the Fire.\n\nFriday's sales were third and fourth auctions of stakes in the eight Hundred teams, following an opening pair on Thursday. So far, the sales come to a total of around £285m.\n\nOn Thursday, a 49% share in Oval Invincibles was sold to the owners of Indian Premier League team Mumbai Indians for around £60m.\n\nA same-sized stake in Birmingham Phoenix then went to Knighthead Capital, the owners of Birmingham City Football Club, for about £40m.\n\nLike the MCC, both Surrey and Warwickshire, hosts of the Invincibles and Phoenix respectively, opted to retain their 51% shares.\n\nFor each of the deals there will now be an eight-week exclusivity partnership to finalise the details.\n\nThe varied backgrounds of the three successful bidders to date fulfils the ECB's stated desire of a blend of investors, rather an IPL takeover of The Hundred.\n\nThe consortium that has agreed the deal for the Spirit is known as Cricket Investor Holdings Limited. Indian-born Arora has been leading Palo Alto Networks, a cybersecurity giant, since 2018. He previously spent a decade at Google.\n\nThe MCC described Arora's group as \"11 high net-worth individuals\". The consortium includes Egon Durban, the chief executive of Silver Lake Management, Satyan Gajwani, the co-founder of Major League Cricket and vice-chairman of Times Internet, Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, Shantanu Narayen the chief executive of Adobe, and Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google.\n\nMontreal-born Govil is the founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions, which is based in Rockville, Maryland and has an annual revenue of $2bn with 20,000 employees globally.\n\nGovil made his first foray into professional cricket franchise ownership with Freedom during the first season of MLC in 2023 with his son Avikar also actively involved in the day-to-day running of the team.\n\nFreedom have a strategic partnership with Cricket New South Wales and have a strong Australian flavour to their set-up.\n\nFreedom's owners beat off interest from Capri International, which owns UP Warriorz in India's Women's Premier League and Sharjah Warriors in the UAE's International League T20 to secure a deal for Fire.\n\nWrexham Football Club's Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenny were among those who were interested in acquiring a stake in Fire but were not part of the final auction\n\nThe ECB is retaining control of The Hundred competition, but is selling stakes in the teams to provide a cash injection to the game in this country.\n\nThe hosts of the eight teams have been given a 51% stake in their franchise, which they can sell or keep, with the ECB then selling the remaining 49%.\n\nThe eight hosts are Lord's (Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)/London Spirit), The Oval (Surrey/Oval Invincibles), Southampton (Hampshire/Southern Brave), Cardiff (Glamorgan/Welsh Fire), Trent Bridge (Nottinghamshire/Trent Rockets), Edgbaston (Warwickshire/Birmingham Phoenix), Old Trafford (Lancashire/Manchester Originals) and Headingley (Yorkshire/Northern Superchargers).\n\nOf the 51% the hosts have been given, they can keep all, or choose to sell all or part of their stake.\n\nFrom the total money raised, 10% will go straight to the recreational game. Proceeds from the 49% sales will be divided between the 18 first-class counties and the MCC. If a host decides to sell part or all of its stake, it will hand over 10% of what it receives to be divided between the 18 counties and MCC.\n\nLittle change is expected to The Hundred for the upcoming 2025 season, which the ECB sees as \"transitional\". Some team names, colours or branding could change in 2026.",

Our national teams have benefitted greatly from the time spent in Sydney these past few months, and we look forward to exploring opportunities for further development with CNSW and SCC in the future.”\n\nRod Chapman, Chair of Sydney Cricket Club, addressed the tightrope of knowledge-sharing with international entities, adding that globalising the game was inevitable. “The Sydney Cricket Club is a club without borders. Whilst we have a responsibility to grow the game in Sydney, through our relationships with Cricket NSW and SCG Cricket we also acknowledge cricket’s globalisation and we want to support that. We have the resources and desire to help others grow whilst at the same time offering huge opportunity for our players and members.”",

        "date": "Thu Jan 30 20:56:42 2025",
        "body": "Mumbai Indians’ owners, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), are set to buy a 49% stake in Oval Invincibles after securing the deal in a virtual auction held on Thursday afternoon. The acquisition strengthens RIL’s growing presence in global cricket leagues, expanding their footprint beyond the Indian Premier League (IPL), SA20, and Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nRIL, one of India’s largest conglomerates, will now enter a period of exclusivity to finalize negotiations with Surrey County Cricket Club, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), and their financial advisors before completing the purchase. The deal marks a major shift in The Hundred, England’s professional franchise cricket league, as it paves the way for private investment in the competition for the first time.\n\nValuation of the Deal\n\nThe winning bid valued the entire Oval Invincibles franchise at £123 million, implying that RIL’s 49% stake will cost just over £60 million. While the ECB has not officially confirmed the deal, reports suggest that RIL outbid competitors to secure the ownership rights.\n\nNeither Surrey County Cricket Club nor the ECB has commented on the successful bidders or the valuations involved. The ECB is expected to make an official announcement next week, confirming the stakeholders involved in the private investment structure.\n\nReliance’s Expanding Cricket Empire\n\nThe acquisition of Oval Invincibles marks yet another step in Reliance Industries’ expansion in global cricket. RIL already owns franchises in various leagues across different continents, including:\n\nMumbai Indians (IPL – India)\n\nMI Cape Town (SA20 – South Africa)\n\nMI New York (MLC – USA)\n\nMI Emirates (ILT20 – UAE)\n\nWith the purchase of a stake in Oval Invincibles, RIL now enters The Hundred, which the ECB launched in 2021 as a unique 100-ball format to attract new audiences. The move aligns with Reliance’s vision of becoming a dominant player in franchise cricket worldwide.\n\nThe Significance of Private Investment in The Hundred\n\nThis deal is significant as The Hundred has traditionally been a competition owned and operated by the ECB. However, private investment was approved by the ECB to help franchises attract capital, increase commercial value, and strengthen the league’s sustainability.\n\nOval Invincibles is one of the eight teams in The Hundred, based at The Oval in London and partnered with Surrey County Cricket Club.\n\nThe ECB has been seeking external investment to boost revenue streams and enhance team development.\n\nReliance’s entry into The Hundred signals increased commercial interest from overseas investors.\n\nThe ECB has been carefully evaluating potential investors, ensuring that the league remains financially stable while allowing counties to benefit from new capital injection. With Reliance’s deep financial backing, Oval Invincibles will likely benefit from better facilities, marketing strategies, and international player acquisition.\n\nWhy RIL Targeted Oval Invincibles\n\nReliance’s interest in Oval Invincibles stems from multiple factors:\n\nStrong Fan Base & London Market:\n\nThe Oval is one of England’s most prestigious cricket venues, known for its historic significance.\n\nLondon remains a prime cricket market, making it an attractive investment location.\n\nGrowth Potential of The Hundred:\n\nThe ECB has been expanding the league’s commercial footprint, making it a promising long-term investment.\n\nWith private capital, The Hundred can compete better with leagues like the IPL and SA20.\n\nSynergy with Mumbai Indians Brand:\n\nMumbai Indians have a strong brand presence in franchise cricket, and acquiring a team in The Hundred helps diversify their portfolio.\n\nGlobal brand exposure will increase, with players and staff potentially crossing over between different leagues.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Reliance and Oval Invincibles\n\nNow that Reliance Industries has secured the winning bid, the next phase will involve:\n\nFinalizing Agreements: RIL will negotiate with Surrey, ECB, and financial advisors to outline the ownership structure.\n\nStrategic Planning: Oval Invincibles’ cricketing and commercial strategies may evolve under new leadership, focusing on international partnerships and fan engagement.\n\nImpact on The Hundred: If the deal finalizes smoothly, it could set a precedent for more private investments in The Hundred, leading to potential new owners entering the league.",
        "summary": "Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), the owner of Mumbai Indians, has acquired a 49% stake in Oval Invincibles, a team in England's professional franchise cricket league, The Hundred. This deal expands RIL's presence in global cricket leagues, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), SA20, and Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA. RIL already owns MI New York, a franchise in the MLC. This acquisition marks another step in RIL's expansion in global cricket, strengthening its footprint beyond India and South Africa."
