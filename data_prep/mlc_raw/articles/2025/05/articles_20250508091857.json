        "title": "Major League Cricket’s Bay Area debut aiming to grow U.S. cricket presence",
        "date": "Wed May  7 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "Major League Cricket “will finally land in Oakland’s backyard,” marking a “potential turning point in long-term growth for the sport in the U.S. and especially the Bay Area, which is home to a well-established and fast-growing” South Asian population, according to Noah Furtado of the S.F. CHRONICLE. MLC club S.F. Unicorns’ home debut will take place at the Oakland Coliseum on June 12. The league currently has six teams but MLC Venue Manager David White said that the league “expects to add two expansion teams” in 2027 and two more in 2029, “sandwiched around” cricket returning as an Olympic sport at the 2028 L.A. Games. MLC’s tournament at the Coliseum will “squeeze in nine matches in seven days” from June 12-18 while USL Championship club Oakland Roots SC go without a home soccer match for a few weeks. The grass pitch to be installed in the middle of the Coliseum was “recently transported” from N.Y. Building a drop-in pitch for MLC in Oakland “started about 18 months ago.” Adelaide Oval Head Curator Damian Hough spearheaded the manufacturing of a handful of drop-in pitches in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for four months and transported them to N.Y. for the 2024 T20 World Cup, before most recently “coordinating their transit to Oakland.” He realizes the “magnitude of the work he’s currently doing,” saying he sees “such a great momentum building in America” (S.F. CHRONICLE, 5/6).",
