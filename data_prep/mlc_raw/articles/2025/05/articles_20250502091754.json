        "body": "Romario Shepherd, the dynamic T20 all-rounder from the West Indies, has signed with the San Francisco Unicorns for the 2025 Cognizant Major League Cricket season.\n\nHaving made his name in the Caribbean Premier League, Shepherd, 30, has gone on to become a household T20 star, representing some of the biggest global franchises in the world, including Mumbai Indians and Joburg Super Kings, while earning over 50 T20I caps for his native West Indies.\n\nShepherd holds career-best bowling figures of 4/13 in the shortest format, and while known primarily for his pace with the ball, has gained a well-earned reputation as a destructive finisher at the crease, with an international average of over 26 at a strike rate of 139.\n\nThe West Indian will come prepared for the conditions of MLC cricket and the strength of the Unicorns’ team, having represented MI New York four times in 2024, including an appearance against his new side at the Grand Prairie Stadium, which ended in a Unicorns victory.\n\nRomario Shepherd is the latest signing to bolster the San Francisco team’s roster for the new season, with Australian internationals Cooper Connolly and Xavier Bartlett recently announced, along with New Zealand international wicketkeeper batsman Tim Seifert.\n\nRomario Shepherd said: “I’ve seen first-hand the quality and entertainment that’s on show at Major League Cricket, and this represents a huge opportunity to return for the 2025 season and help the Unicorns to success in what’s going to be the tournament’s biggest edition yet.\n\n“I got a taste of the Texas support and Grand Prairie atmosphere last year, but playing in front of our home fans for the first time at the Oakland Coliseum will be a completely different experience. I can’t wait to get started with Shane and the team.”\n\nShane Watson, Head Coach of the San Francisco Unicorns, said: “Romario’s reputation on the global T20 circuit is impressive. His experience playing in different conditions and ability to both lead the bowling attack and finish an innings with the bat will be a major asset to the Unicorns this season.\n\n“We’re continuing to build a squad that can adapt as a team and individuals to various conditions, while always looking to dominate with power hitting and smart bowling, and Romario’s professionalism and skillset will be a strong fit for our playing style.”\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns will kick off the 2025 MLC season at the Oakland Coliseum in California, opening the tournament against last year’s champions, Washington Freedom, on Thursday, June 12. They’ll play two more matches at the same venue—facing the LA Knight Riders on June 14 and MI New York on June 15—before the teams move on to the next set of fixtures at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.",

        "body": "Romario Shepherd has joined San Francisco Unicorns for MLC 2025 [Source: @iplt20.com]\n\nBig hits, explosive spells and Caribbean flair, the San Francisco Unicorns just bagged themselves a serious T20 weapon. Romario Shepherd, one of the most explosive all-rounders in the global T20 scene, is all set to light up the 2025 Major League Cricket (MLC) season after officially signing with the Unicorns.\n\nRomario Shepherd Signs With San Francisco Unicorns For MLC 2025\n\nCurrently donning the red and black for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in IPL 2025, Shepherd is no stranger to big stages. From smashing sixes for West Indies to rattling stumps for Mumbai Indians, the 30-year-old has made a name for himself as a proper match-winner and the Unicorns just got themselves a major upgrade.\n\nRomario Shepherd isn’t your average utility player. He has got best bowling figures of 4/13 in T20s and boasts an international strike rate of 139, not bad for someone who started out as a pacer but now finishes games with the bat too. In over 50 T20Is for West Indies, he has shown he can swing it both ways, the ball and the momentum.\n\nAnd he’s no stranger to MLC either. He turned out for MI New York in 2024 and even faced off against the San Fransisco Unicorns in a cracking contest at Grand Prairie. Now, he will wear the Unicorns’ colours and will be ready to hit the ground running.\n\nThe 2025 season will be extra special, not just for the fans, but for Shepherd too, who will be playing at the Oakland Coliseum for the very first time.\n\n“I got a taste of the Texas support and Grand Prairie atmosphere last year,” said Shepherd. “But playing in front of our home fans for the first time at the Oakland Coliseum will be a completely different experience. I can’t wait to get started with Shane and the team.”\n\nUnicorns Building A Powerhouse\n\nThe San Francisco squad is quietly cooking something big this year. With Aussie young gun Cooper Connolly, pace machine Xavier Bartlett, Kiwi keeper Tim Seifert and now Romario in the mix, they are mixing youth, experience and firepower in equal measure.\n\nCoach Shane Watson couldn’t be more pumped.\n\n“Romario’s reputation on the global T20 circuit is impressive. His experience playing in different conditions and ability to both lead the bowling attack and finish an innings with the bat will be a major asset to the Unicorns this season.”\n\nMLC 2025 Schedule Kicks Off With A Bang\n\nThe Unicorns will begin their campaign with a blockbuster opener against defending champs Washington Freedom on June 12. Two more back-to-back home clashes follow against LA Knight Riders (June 14) and MI New York (June 15) before the action shifts to Grand Prairie in Texas.",

        "date": "",
        "body": "As the third season of Major League Cricket unfolds, the battle for playoff spots is expected to be closer than ever. With six teams vying for just four positions in the knockouts, every match result has the potential to shake up the standings. This live points table provides up-to-the-minute updates on team rankings, wins, losses, and Net Run Rate — the key metric that often determines qualification in tight races.\n\nPoints will be awarded in the usual format: two for a win, one for a no result or tie, and none for a loss. In the event of teams finishing level on points, Net Run Rate will act as the tiebreaker.\n\nKeep checking this space to follow your team’s journey through the group stage and into the playoffs.\n\nIn a short-format league like Major League Cricket, consistency is everything. With each team playing ten league matches, the points table can change dramatically in a matter of days. A single win or loss can be the difference between playoff qualification and early elimination, making this table one of the most watched sections of the tournament.\n\nAs teams progress through the round-robin stage, the points table reflects not just their wins and losses, but also their margins of victory or defeat. That’s where the Net Run Rate, or NRR, becomes a decisive factor. In past seasons, playoff spots have been decided by razor-thin NRR differences, underscoring the importance of playing dominant, efficient cricket from the outset.\n\nCurrently, each team is looking to accumulate enough points to finish in the top four, which ensures entry into the knockout stage. Once there, the format favours the top two teams by giving them two shots at reaching the final. That dynamic adds further pressure on teams not just to qualify, but to finish high in the table.\n\nThis live points tracker will be your guide through every twist and turn of the MLC 2025 journey. From a team’s early surge to a late-season comeback, the story of the tournament will unfold here, game by game, number by number."
