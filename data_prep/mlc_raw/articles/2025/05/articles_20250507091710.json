        "date": "",
        "body": "So there you have it, we have both our finalists for the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket! MI New York will meet the Seattle Orcas on Sunday at this very venue. As for the Texas Super Kings, this is the end of their campaign. Right, that's it from us, do make sure you join us back here for the final on Sunday (or Monday depending on where you stay). This is Anurag signing off on behalf of Abhinav and Vinod. Take care and goodbye.\n\nNicholas Pooran | MINY Captain: The message was about replicating our performance from yesterday. We felt that we were getting better as a team and were getting contributions from everyone. The openers gave us a start and Brevis took responsibility to play through that innings and then David came out and played that blinder. We were controlling the game very nicely, we bowled well tonight. Kenjige wasn’t needed tonight. Brevis really wanted to play and he’s grabbed his opportunities.\n\nFaf du Plessis | TSK Captain: Our batting has been below par right throughout the tournament, starting with myself. We scratched our way to most of the totals. Tonight we held some composure and got to a decent total. Fought really hard in the field but they’ve got a really strong middle order. Really tough to find form, especially when the conditions are different on the field and at practice. It’s not like a one-day game where you can take some time, there’s always scoreboard pressure. Some guys have been in good form while others have struggled. We need to really try and dominate the first 10 overs. The second 10 overs is where the damage gets done so it’s about playing well in the first 10. Get a good score and then there’s always a death bowler you can target. Seen a lot of yellow shirts, it’s been a positive. Thank you all very much.\n\nTrent Boult | Player of the Match: Nice to come back here, great conditions. Yesterday’s wicket was a good challenge, excellent from the boys to defend an under-par score. Had a chat last night, was great to come out here and chase the score down. Always enjoyable, very satisfying to stand up and do well in a big game. Looking forward to the final. Some good words were spoken and there was clear direction, we got a good start and some lusty blows towards the end. We’re fully focussed on Sunday. Body seems good. It’s about going out there and enjoying it.\n\nTim David: (On bowling the last over) I was not expecting it. But I knew we had to make up the overs after the injury. (On making the final) Success would be winning a trophy. Have come close to winning it a couple of times in the IPL, it’s a different tournament but the franchise is the same. Everyone is excited right now because we have done it as a team. (On the run-chase) Got away from us a little bit. It then came down to taking a bit of a chance and it came off today. We were trying to score but we just could not get it. Glad that when we took our chances and backed ourselves, it paid off.\n\nSantner, who had been expensive earlier, conceded 16 in the 15th over and the next over bowled by Mohsin went for 19. Even as David fell in that over, MINY had got the impetus they needed to surge forward and hunt the total down. The TSK bowlers faltered under pressure and ended up serving some juicy deliveries that were promptly dealt with by both Brevis and Wiese. TSK probably had an outside chance in the penultimate over but Mohsin put down a simple chance and then it was all over with the equation already down to a run-a-ball at the start of that over.\n\n23:15 Local Time, 04:15 GMT, 09:45 IST: What a thriller that turned out to be! It seemed like the game was heading only one way until the 14th over before MINY clawed their way back into it to claim victory and make it through to the finals. After putting the Super Kings into bat, MINY restricted them to 158 - a total that TSK themselves admitted was slightly below par. The chase started off fairly well for New York as Jahangir cut loose even as his partner struggled. However, he played one shot too many and that's where their struggles began. The ball didn't quite come on to the bat nicely and the MINY batters struggled to keep the scoreboard ticking. Once Pooran departed, they were under serious pressure as both Brevis and David looked extremely scratchy. The TSK bowlers put the squeeze on and the runs dried up to a trickle. The asking rate had climbed up to 11 an over and that's when the game changed.\n\n18.6\n\nDaniel Sams to Brevis, FOUR, it's all over! MINY are through to the final of MLC 2023! Back of a length on middle, Brevis hangs back and heaves it away over mid-wicket, lets out a loud roar as it races away to the boundary\n\n18.5\n\nDaniel Sams to Wiese, 1 run, yorker on off-stump, was slower too, Wiese pushed it down hard into the pitch and it bounced over Sams\n\nJust 2 needed to win now\n\n18.4\n\nDaniel Sams to Brevis, 1 run, very full and wide outside off, Brevis slices it out towards deep extra cover, taken on the bounce\n\n18.3\n\nDaniel Sams to Wiese, 1 run, length delivery on off-stump, bunted down towards long-off\n\n18.2\n\nDaniel Sams to Wiese, SIX, insult to injury! Half-tracker dug in outside off, Wiese hangs back in and shuffles across to heave it away powerfully over the deep mid-wicket fence, all but over now\n\n18.1\n\nDaniel Sams to Wiese, 2 runs, dropped! Oh dear, would you believe it? That's exactly what TSK needed and Mohsin grasses it! Full and wide outside off, Wiese reaches out and carves it out towards deep backward point where Mohsin put down a simple chance\n\nDaniel Sams [3.0-0-16-1] is back into the attack\n\nIt's down to a run-a-ball now, MINY's game to lose from here\n\n17.6\n\nSavage to Wiese, 1 run, length delivery just outside off, punched down to long-off"
