        "body": "The opening matches of this year's Major League Cricket tournament will be played on drop-in pitches used for last summer's T20 World Cup in New York.\n\nTwo of the four turf pitches installed at Eisenhower Park in Nassau County have been dug up and transported 3,000 miles by trailer to the Oakland Coliseum in California.\n\nMLC have enlisted Damian Hough, head curator at the Adelaide Oval, to oversee their installation at the iconic former home of the Oakland Athletics baseball team.\n\nThe pitches, which proved difficult for batting during the T20 World Cup fixtures at the Long Island venue, will have a month to bed in before MLC's third season gets under way in Oakland on 12 June.\n\nMLC officials are confident that following a bit more use the pitches will be more conducive to runscoring than was achieved during the World Cup where the average score was just 107.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the nine MLC fixtures at the Oakland Coliseum the pitches will be dug up again then stored for future use by the USA's franchise tournament.\n\nThe two pitches which have remained at the ground in New York are under the control of Nassau County which leaves the potential for major cricket to be played in Eisenhower Park again at some stage in the future.\n\nThere had been hopes matches at the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 2028 could be played there, with the timezone in New York more appealing to South Asian TV audiences.\n\nThat prospect faded when it was announced the cricket tournament at LA 2028 would be played at a temporary stadium in Pomona, a southern Californian city about an hour's drive from the athletes' village.\n\nAnd when contacted by BBC Sport a spokesperson for LA 2028 reiterated that \"cricket will be played in Pomona at LA 2028\" with no other sites seemingly under consideration.\n\nMLC had been keen to hold games at the pop-up stadium in New York before it was dismantled after the conclusion of the World Cup last year, but costs were too prohibitive.",
