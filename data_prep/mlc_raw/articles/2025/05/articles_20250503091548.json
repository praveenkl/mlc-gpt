        "body": "The San Francisco Unicorns have made a high-impact acquisition ahead of Major League Cricket (MLC) 2025 by signing West Indies’ dynamic all-rounder Romario Shepherd. Known for his fierce pace and explosive batting, Shepherd is set to bring unmatched energy and Caribbean firepower to the West Coast franchise this season.\n\nRCB Star Heads West for MLC 2025\n\nCurrently representing Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2025, Romario Shepherd has been in sublime form, showcasing his dual threat with both bat and ball. His transition from IPL to MLC will be closely watched, as the 30-year-old continues to evolve into one of T20 cricket’s most feared finishers. From turning games around for West Indies to delivering crucial spells for Mumbai Indians in the past, Shepherd’s ability to make an impact under pressure is well documented.\n\nNot Just a Power Hitter\n\nWith over 50 T20 Internationals under his belt, Shepherd is far more than just a slogger. He has recorded best bowling figures of 4/13 in T20s and maintains a batting strike rate nearing 140 at the international level. His ability to shift momentum—whether with quick wickets or late-innings sixes—makes him a prized asset for any T20 side.\n\nFamiliar With MLC Turf\n\nShepherd is no stranger to Major League Cricket. He previously featured for MI New York during the 2024 season, where he even played against the San Francisco Unicorns in an electrifying clash. Now, he will be donning the Unicorns’ jersey and is eager to make his mark at their new home ground—Oakland Coliseum.\n\n“Playing in front of home fans at the Oakland Coliseum will be something special,” Shepherd shared. “Last year’s atmosphere in Texas was electric, but this will be on a whole new level.”\n\nThe Unicorns’ Growing Arsenal\n\nThe addition of Shepherd bolsters what is already shaping up to be a star-studded squad. Alongside rising Aussie talent Cooper Connolly, Kiwi wicketkeeper Tim Seifert, and pacer Xavier Bartlett, the Unicorns are building a side rich in youth, experience, and firepower.\n\nHead Coach Shane Watson, himself a T20 legend, emphasized Shepherd’s strategic importance:\n\n“Romario brings a wealth of experience and versatility. Whether we need quick wickets or late-order fireworks, he’s the kind of player who can change the course of a match in just a few overs.”\n\nBlockbuster Start to MLC 2025\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns are set to kick off their MLC 2025 campaign on June 12 with a highly anticipated showdown against defending champions Washington Freedom. The action continues with back-to-back home matches at the Oakland Coliseum against LA Knight Riders (June 14) and MI New York (June 15), promising an exciting start to the season.\n\nRomario Shepherd’s signing is a statement of intent from the San Francisco Unicorns. With his mix of aggression, skill, and T20 experience, he’s poised to become a fan favorite in Oakland. As the MLC 2025 season approaches, all eyes will be on this powerhouse team and their Caribbean star, ready to make waves on American soil.",
