        "body": "Australian cricket legend David Warner has embarked on a thrilling new journey, signing with the Seattle Orcas for the 2025 season of Major League Cricket (MLC). The explosive opener, who retired from international cricket in 2023, will headline the USA-based T20 league’s third edition starting June 12—marking his debut in a tournament rapidly gaining global traction. For Warner, this move adds another chapter to a globetrotting career spanning nine T20 leagues, from the IPL to the BBL.\n\nDavid Warner’s MLC Mission\n\nAt 38, Warner remains a T20 powerhouse. With 12,956 runs in 401 matches (strike rate: 140.27), his résumé is unmatched. Yet, his MLC signing comes after a surprising IPL 2025 auction snub, ending a 16-year streak in the league where he ranks fourth all-time in runs (6,565). Undeterred, Warner dominated Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL) this winter, captaining Sydney Thunder to the final while amassing 405 runs (second-highest in the tournament).\n\nThe Seattle Orcas, who finished last in MLC 2024 with just one win, see Warner as the catalyst for revival. Seattle’s GM, Soma Somasegar, called the signing “a transformative moment” for the franchise, which topped the 2023 regular season before falling to MI New York in the final. David Warner’s pedigree—he recently led Dubai Capitals to the ILT20 title—brings clutch experience to a team craving leadership.\n\nWhy Seattle Orcas? Warner’s expanding T20 universe\n\nWarner’s MLC leap isn’t just about runs; it’s about legacy. The league’s growth aligns with his post-retirement vision to popularize cricket in non-traditional markets. “The U.S. is the next frontier,” Warner said in a recent PSL interview. “I want to help build something special here.”\n\nHis arrival also fills a strategic gap for Seattle. The Seattle Orcas’ batting faltered in 2024, averaging just 145 runs per game. Warner’s aggressive starts and tactical acumen (he’s captained sides in the IPL, BBL, and PSL) could stabilize their top order while mentoring young talents like Shehan Jayasuriya.\n\nMLC 2025: A clash-free calendar boost\n\nMLC’s 2025 window (June 12–July 13) avoids overlaps with The Hundred, where David Warner will also feature for London Spirit. This scheduling savvy ensures marquee players like Warner can maximize their visibility without burnout—a win for leagues and fans alike.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nWarner’s signing signals MLC’s rising credibility. After luring stars like Kieron Pollard and Trent Boult in previous seasons, adding a drawcard of Warner’s caliber amplifies its appeal. For U.S. cricket, his presence could accelerate grassroots interest ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup, co-hosted by America.\n\nAs David Warner gears up for his Seattle debut, the Seattle Orcas’ faithful are dreaming big. Can the Aussie icon turn last year’s strugglers into contenders? One thing’s certain: the MLC just got a whole lot brighter.",
        "summary": "**Main Event:** Australian cricket legend David Warner has signed with the Seattle Orcas for the 2025 season of Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\n**Key Details:**\n\n* The 2025 MLC season will start on June 12 and marks Warner's debut in the tournament.\n* Warner, 38, remains a T20 powerhouse with an unmatched résumé, having played in nine T20 leagues, including the IPL and BBL.\n* The Seattle Orcas, who finished last in MLC 2024, see Warner as the catalyst for revival, bringing clutch experience and leadership to the team.\n* Warner's signing is strategic, as he can stabilize the team's top order and mentor young talents like Shehan Jayasuriya.\n* The 2025 MLC window avoids overlaps with The Hundred, ensuring Warner can maximize his visibility without burnout.\n* Warner's presence in MLC signals the tournament's rising credibility, amplifying its appeal and potentially accelerating grassroots interest in cricket in the US ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup."

I guess the mystery, and he's hard to pick at times, as we've seen through this tournament, especially in Chennai, where there has been a little bit of assistance, he's been outstanding.\"\n\n\"If it is going to be a slightly slower wicket like last game we know he's gonna be a challenge if they go to other spinners, they will be as well,\" said Santner.\n\n'You have to be smart against Noor'\n\nSantner said that the only way to tackle Noor's threat is by being smart against him.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"I think you gotta be quite smart against him. I think if he gets on a roll, he's pretty tough to stop as we've seen. He's bowled extremely well, and he's a great guy, so I'm happy for him,\" said Santner.\n\nSantner also talked about the wicket for the game on Sunday and said if it is a red soil pitch, then it could be on the slower side. However, the all-rounder said if it is a flat track, then it will be all about bowling efficiently and get powerplay wickets.\n\n\"Red soil usually offers more bounce, and the other day, it was slightly slower, so bowling cutters worked well. If the wicket’s like that again, we know how to approach it. But if it’s flat — like it was in the Bangalore game — then it’s more about getting in and out of overs efficiently. As we’ve seen this season, powerplay wickets are really the only way to slow teams down,\" said Santner.\n\nTune In",

        "date": "Sat Apr 19 16:14:25 2025",
        "body": "The Seattle Orcas have recruited former Australia opener David Warner for the third Major League Cricket (MLC) season, which starts on June 12, 2025. He will be playing in the USA-based T20 competition for the first time. Warner, who is presently captaining the Karachi Kings in the PSL, has played in tournaments all around the world and has a lot of T20 experience with him. He has amassed 12,956 runs at a strike rate of 140.27 in 401 Twenty20 matches. In June of last year, he announced his retirement from international cricket.\n\nDavid Warner’s participation in the MLC is anticipated to increase the league’s visibility internationally. His appearance is expected to increase attendance and ticket sales, particularly among Indian and Australian fans. His leadership expertise and aggressive top-order batting will help the Seattle Orcas become a serious contender for the 2025 campaign.\n\nAfter competing in the IPL since 2009, David Warner was one of the most well-known players to be unsold in the auction ahead of IPL 2025. With 6565 runs from 184 innings, he remains the fourth-highest run scorer in the IPL. He did, however, have a significant impact on the BBL this season when he returned as captain of the Sydney Thunder and guided them to the championship game. With 405 runs in 12 innings, he also ended as the league’s second-highest scorer.\n\nDavid Warner’s performance in other leagues indicates that he is far from finished, even if he was not selected for the IPL this year. His leadership led a youthful Thunder team to the final, and his steady play in the BBL confirmed his worth in franchise cricket. Warner may be the game-changer Seattle needs, based on his background and present play.\n\nDavid Warner also played for the Dubai Capitals, who won the ILT20 in February of this year.\n\nHis contribution to the Dubai Capitals’ ILT20 victory further demonstrates his cross-continental T20 skill. Despite not being the league’s leading scorer, his consistency at the top of the order and deft fielding were vital in pivotal matches.\n\nIn 2023, Seattle won the MLC table, but MI New York defeated them in the championship game. With just one victory in seven games during the second season under Heinrich Klaasen’s leadership, they finished bottom in the standings.\n\nThe Orcas’ dramatic drop from finals to the bottom of the standings highlights their inconsistent play. The organisation is hoping that David Warner’s presence would bring much-needed consistency and a winning mentality. His ability to perform well under duress will be crucial this season as he navigates challenging circumstances.\n\nThe dates of MLC 2025 are set for June 12–13. Warner will play for London Spirit at The Hundred, so it won’t conflict as it did last year.\n\nThe MLC and The Hundred both greatly benefit from this scheduling convenience. David Warner has a unique chance to have an impact on two significant tournaments in a single summer as he can devote himself entirely to the Seattle Orcas’ campaign without any schedule issues.\n\nDavid Warner is able to concentrate entirely on MLC 2025 without being sidetracked by conflicting obligations because to its smooth availability. Additionally, it gives the Seattle Orcas a unique opportunity to use one of the world’s most seasoned T20 players for the duration of the season. He will provide much-needed continuity to the squad by being available for training camps, team-building exercises, and matchday tactics. The league as a whole will gain from David Warner’s heightened star power and worldwide attention, which follow him wherever he plays, and American fans will be excited to see his powerful hitting in person.",
        "summary": "* The Seattle Orcas have signed former Australian opener David Warner for the third season of the MLC, which starts on June 12, 2025.\n* Warner brings a wealth of T20 experience, having played 401 matches with a strike rate of 140.27, and is expected to increase the league's international visibility and attract Indian and Australian fans.\n* His leadership skills and aggressive batting style are expected to make the Seattle Orcas a strong contender for the 2025 campaign.\n* Warner's participation is crucial for the Orcas, who finished bottom of the standings in the second season with just one win in seven games under Heinrich Klaasen's leadership.\n* The organization hopes Warner's presence will bring consistency and a winning mentality to the team.\n* The MLC 2025 schedule (June 12-13) does not conflict with Warner's commitments to The Hundred, allowing him to focus entirely on the MLC campaign.\n* Warner's availability for the entire season, including training camps and team-building exercises, will provide much-needed continuity to the squad and boost the league's international profile."

Despite being one of the most consistent performers in T20 cricket, Warner went unsold in the recent IPL auction, which led him to seek opportunities elsewhere. He is currently captaining the Karachi Kings in the PSL, marking his debut in the tournament.\n\nHowever, Warner's performance in T20 leagues has continued to shine, earning him a spot in Major League Cricket. He has now signed a contract with the Seattle Orcas for the upcoming season of MLC, where he will bring his vast experience to the team.\n\nWarner’s Impressive T20 Career\n\nWarner’s T20 career has been nothing short of stellar. With nearly 13,000 runs in 401 T20 matches at a strike rate of 140.27, he is regarded as one of the best in the format. Though he retired from international cricket in June 2024, Warner's focus has shifted entirely to league cricket, where his performances continue to speak volumes.\n\nCan David Warner Lead Seattle Orcas to Their First MLC Title?"
