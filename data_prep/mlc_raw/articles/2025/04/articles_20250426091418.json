        "body": "Major League Cricket announced that it is “moving its headquarters” from S.F. to Grand Prairie in North Texas, according to Paul Wedding of WFAA.com. Grand Prairie is the home of Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium -- which will host MLC’s playoffs and championship final, as well as 12 regular-season games across 10 days from June 20 through June 29 (WFAA.com, 4/24). BLOOMBERG NEWS’ Joe Lovinger noted the move comes as MLC “seeks to build a US following for one of the world’s most popular sports.” The season will run just one month, from June 12 to July 13. MLC CEO Johnny Grave said that the “goal is ‘owning a part of the calendar,’ a window for teams to bring in top overseas players when larger leagues aren’t playing” (BLOOMBERG NEWS, 4/24).\n\nNEW ADDITION: In Auckland, Alex Powell reported New Zealand Cricket announced a venture with True North Sports Ventures to “create a new franchise” within MLC. NZC will “play a central role in the operation of the franchise,” as it enters America’s T20 league in 2027. Powell wrote should the venture “prove successful,” NZC “could invest in a second team from 2031.” The move will allow NZC a “vehicle to allow top Kiwi players to ply their trade in the lucrative franchise league,” at a time when the national organization “faces a fight to keep its best and brightest centrally contracted.” It will also be “beneficial both financially and practically for NZC,” given MLC is valued at more than $119.5M (NEW ZEALAND HERALD, 4/24).",
        "summary": "**Headquarters Move**: Major League Cricket is relocating its headquarters from San Francisco to Grand Prairie, Texas, where the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium will host playoffs, championship finals, and 12 regular-season games from June 20 to June 29.\n\n**Tournament Details**: The MLC season will run from June 12 to July 13, a one-month window, with the goal of \"owning a part of the calendar\" to attract top overseas players when larger leagues aren't playing.\n\n**New Zealand Cricket Partnership**: New Zealand Cricket has partnered with True North Sports Ventures to create a new franchise in MLC, set to launch in 2027. This venture will allow top New Zealand players to participate in the lucrative league, benefiting NZC financially and practically.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify or expand on any of these points!"

        "body": "We have seen franchises having sister franchises in different cricket leagues of the world, evidenced by IPL teams’ sister franchises operating in leagues such as the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), SA20, Major League Cricket (USA) and ILT20 (UAE). This year, several IPL teams even bought stakes in The Hundred, making their foray into the English market.\n\nHowever, what shocked the world on April 24 (Thursday) was the announcement by New Zealand Cricket, where they informed of their partnership with US-based company True North Sports Ventures (TNS) to launch a new team in Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nThis is the first of its kind deal where no club (franchise), but the entire board has decided to launch a team in a different T20 league than its own. The team will be announced later this year and will start participating in MLC from the 2027 season onwards, when the league will expand to eight teams from its current format of six teams.\n\nAccording to New Zealand Cricket’s website, “TNS is exploring several key markets across North America, including Toronto and Atlanta, to base the new franchise.”\n\nIn the deal, New Zealand Cricket will provide that team with high-performance and operational support, including coaching, management, and support staff, as well as integrating the franchise into NZC’s domestic high-performance ecosystem. In the second phase of development, NZC will offer expertise in cricket infrastructure and turf management.\n\nSo what will the board get in return? According to NZC chief executive Scott Weenink, “[This deal will] diversify our revenue streams, expand our global brand and fan base, and create new talent development and retention pathways for both our players and coaches.”",
        "summary": "* New Zealand Cricket has partnered with True North Sports Ventures (TNS) to launch a new team in the MLC.\n* This is the first instance of a cricket board, rather than a franchise, launching a team in a different T20 league.\n* The new team will be announced later this year and will begin participating in the MLC from the 2027 season, as the league expands from 6 to 8 teams.\n* The team will be based in North America, with potential locations including Toronto and Atlanta.\n* New Zealand Cricket will provide high-performance and operational support to the team, including coaching, management, and support staff, as well as expertise in cricket infrastructure and turf management.\n* The partnership is expected to diversify revenue streams, expand the global brand and fan base, and create new talent development and retention pathways for players and coaches."

        "body": "San Francisco, April 25 (IANS) San Francisco Unicorns have added New Zealand wicketkeeper-batter Tim Seifert to their roster for the 2025 Major League Cricket season. Seifert joins the Unicorns with a wealth of top-level experience in international cricket with 66 T20I caps and over 250 franchise appearances to his name with teams including the Kolkata Knight Riders, Melbourne Renegades, and Northern Districts in his native New Zealand.\n\nSigned for his dual skills with the bat and behind the stumps, Seifert averages over 28 on the international T20 stage with a strike rate of 142, and his signing follows his recent star performance in New Zealand’s T20 series against Pakistan, where he was top scorer, smashing 249 runs at an average of 62 while opening the batting with fellow Unicorns’ star Finn Allen.\n\nKnown for his 360 ability with the bat, Seifert will be tasked with getting the Unicorns off to fast starts when batting, assisting fellow destructive batters such as Jake Fraser-McGurk and Matt Short, while also assisting captain and former NZ international Corey Anderson with strategy in the field.\n\n“I’ve been following MLC from afar over the last couple of seasons, particularly keeping a close eye on some of the Kiwi contingent. I can’t wait to get started this summer, and add some more firepower with a team that is already stacked with talent and in a great position to take things one step further than last year,” Seifert said in a statement.\n\n“The Unicorns are building something big in the Bay Area under the leadership of Shane Watson and the ambitious owners, and with the Oakland Coliseum now set to play a key part as a home fortress, this is an opportunity I had to take.”\n\nShane Watson, head coach of the San Francisco Unicorns, said, “We look for both quality cricketers and quality personalities when bringing players into the Unicorns fold, and Tim definitely checks both those boxes.\n\n“His skills with the gloves will also be a major asset this year, especially with the new wickets in Oakland and Fort Lauderdale offering something of an unknown for spin bowling. He’s also coming in with impressive form with the bat, adding to an already dominant top order alongside Finn (Allen), Shorty (Matt Short), and Jake (Fraser-McGurk).”\n\n–IANS\n\nab/bsk/",
