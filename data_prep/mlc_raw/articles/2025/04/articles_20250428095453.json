According to a statement from NZC, 49ers Enterprises, the NFL team's investment arm, is one of the private equity investors in TNS.\n\nAs a result, NZC will have a stake in the team and an option to invest in a second franchise in the future. It will also provide high-performance and operational support, such as coaching, management, and support personnel, and integrate the franchise into New Zealand's domestic high-performance system. NZC will contribute its knowledge of cricket infrastructure and turf maintenance in a subsequent stage of development.\n\nAt the first MLC launch in 2023, Victoria and New South Wales teamed with the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom, respectively, but NZC's agreement goes much further. Later this year, the NZC-backed franchise is anticipated to reveal further information, including its name.\n\nOakland's Coliseum will host matches for the first time during the 2025 MLC season, which runs from June 13 to July 14.

The 30-year-old will reunite with New Zealand opening partner Finn Allen and former Northern Districts teammate Corey Anderson at the Unicorns.\n\nUnder Anderson‚Äôs leadership, the Unicorns finished as runners-up in MLC 2024.\n\nAlthough Seifert and Allen are currently without central contracts from New Zealand Cricket (NZC), both have committed to being available for all of New Zealand‚Äôs T20I series ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup.

Michael Bracewell, key to New Zealand‚Äôs run to the Champions Trophy final in March, has been signed by MI New York (MINY), where he will join Trent Boult. Boult continues his association with the MI franchise across leagues like the MLC, SA20, and IPL.\n\nDaryl Mitchell, who missed the 2024 season due to injury, has re-signed with the Texas Super Kings (TSK) for 2025. TSK have also retained Devon Conway and Noor Ahmad while adding Adam Milne, who previously played for Washington Freedom, and South African duo Nandre Burger and Donovan Ferreira from Joburg Super Kings.\n\nSeattle Orcas have appointed former New Zealand star Ross Taylor as their ambassador for MLC 2025, with former England batter Ian Bell stepping in as the team‚Äôs new batting coach.\n\nIn a significant development, New Zealand Cricket has become the first national governing body to invest directly in an overseas T20 league, partnering with MLC to launch a new team when the league expands in 2027.\n\nThe 2025 edition of Major League Cricket will run from June 13 to July 14, with Oakland's Coliseum set to host matches for the first time.",

        "body": "By Neil Reid\n\nNew Zealand Cricket has partnered with the financial backers of a new franchise in Major League Cricket ‚Äì a competition which has a value of at least $200 million ‚Äì with the move partly to try to retain the Black Caps‚Äô top talent.\n\nThe bold move is a crucial step from cricket bosses that could help keep some of our leading players ‚Äì and coaches ‚Äì available for Black Caps duty, instead of opting to effectively become freelancers on the global Twenty20 stage.\n\nThe sporting body has signed a deal with US-based company True North Sports Ventures (TNS) for the creation of a new franchise in North America‚Äôs Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nAnd if the franchise agreement goes well, New Zealand Cricket could become investors and backers in a second franchise in the league in 2031.\n\nThe initial team ‚Äì yet to be formally named or have their location confirmed ‚Äì will make their debut in the 2027 season.\n\nThe deal is the first time a full member of the International Cricket Council has partnered with a franchise in a top-level professional cricket league.\n\nNew Zealand Cricket (NZC) chief executive Scott Weenink said as part of the deal, the sporting body would provide high-performance and operational support, including coaching, management and support staff, as well as integrating the franchise into NZC‚Äôs domestic high-performance ecosystem.\n\n‚ÄúThis agreement marks a unique and exciting milestone for NZC,‚Äù Weenink said.\n\n‚ÄúAs franchise cricket grows globally, NZC needs to adapt to seize strategic opportunities that ensure the sustainability of our cricket network.\n\n‚ÄúThis helps diversify our revenue streams, expands our global brand and fan base and creates new talent development and retention pathways for both our players and coaches.‚Äù\n\nThe issue of retention of stars for international duty ‚Äì and of younger players who are coming through the ranks ‚Äì has been an issue facing a growing number of national cricketing bodies in the face of cashed-up T20 cricket leagues around the world.\n\nThat includes NZC, who have seen an increasing number of players turn down central contracts, such as former captain Kane Williamson, Finn Allen and Devon Conway, in favour of cashing in at T20 leagues around the world ‚Äì including those that would clash with Black Caps commitments.\n\nTop players in the US league can earn up to $200,000 for playing a minimum of five matches in the competition.\n\nThat is a salary that makes MLC one of the most lucrative T20 leagues in the world for leading players.\n\nThe value of year-long NZC contracts to leading Black Caps hopefuls ranges from $523,396 to $367,197. The top domestic cricket contract provided by NZC for a season is $102,707.\n\nWeenink said the partnership between NZC and TNS was a historic move and believed it would strengthen its presence in the world‚Äôs most lucrative sporting market.\n\nA location for the franchise was yet to be confirmed.\n\nBut TNS has been ‚Äúexploring‚Äù several potential lucrative markets across North America, including Toronto and Atlanta.\n\nWhile America is yet to make its presence felt hugely on the international cricket scene, it is a nation where cricket has a growing profile.\n\nThe US national team surprised many by being very competitive in the 2024 T20 World Cup, beating Pakistan in a Super Over and giving South Africa and India a few frights during eventual losses to those star-studded sides.\n\nThe MLC competition is one that has huge potential to grow.\n\nIt is estimated there are 25 million cricket fans in the US ‚Äì and cricket is set to get another profile boost when it features as a medal sport at the 2028 LA Olympics.\n\nAmerica‚Äôs professional T20 league was launched in 2023 and currently has six franchises ‚Äì the Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, the San Francisco Unicorns, the Seattle Orcas, the Texas Super Kings and the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe financial clout behind the league is such that the combined value of investors in the current franchises is worth a staggering $220 billion.\n\nInvestors in those six current franchises include property moguls, the chair of a major healthcare company, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella and Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nMLC co-founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan are the majority owners of entities which hold exclusive rights to own and operate two MLC expansion franchises, the first of which will be launched by TNS in 2027.\n\nThe deal will also see NZC offer expertise in cricket infrastructure and turf management.\n\nMLC ‚Äì which achieved ‚ÄúList A‚Äù status before its 2024 season ‚Äì is played over a duration of up to four weeks during June and July. Expansion plans will see up to 10 teams taking part in 2031.\n\nIt is broadcast in the US via Willow TV, as well as being shown globally, including in New Zealand.\n\nThe roster of the six teams currently includes Black Caps Matt Henry, Rachin Ravindra, Finn Allen and Trent Boult.\n\nOverseas stars include Pat Cummins, Travis Head, Steve Smith, and David Miller.\n\nWeenink also confirmed NZC has become a foundation investor in TNS, with the ability to make a more substantial equity investment before the end of 2025.\n\nHe said MLC was a world-class T20 tournament and he was proud to align with Mehta, Srinivasan and the TNS investor group to drive cricket‚Äôs growth in North America.\n\nWeenink said NZC would be joining an array of world-class, global sports, high-net-worth and private equity investors in TNS, including 49ers Enterprises (the investment arm of the NFL‚Äôs San Francisco 49ers), which boasts an enviable portfolio of global sports assets, including recently promoted English Championship side, Leeds United, who will play in the Premier League again next season.\n\nMehta and Srinivasan co-founded Willow TV, North America‚Äôs premier cricket broadcaster, then co-founded MLC and led its successful launch in 2023.\n\n‚ÄúTNS is delighted to partner with NZC, an organisation admired for its sustained success despite limited financial and playing resources compared to other international cricketing bodies,‚Äù Mehta said.\n\n‚ÄúAs founders of start-ups that have rapidly grown to established businesses, we see NZC as a perfect fit for our new franchise.\n\n‚ÄúWith NZC‚Äôs expertise, our expansion franchise will elevate MLC‚Äôs world-class T20 product and support cricket‚Äôs rapid growth in our region.\n\n‚ÄúThe potential for cricket in North America is immense and we look forward to working with NZC to deliver on both our ambitions and theirs, including broader strategic and corporate opportunities globally.‚Äù",
