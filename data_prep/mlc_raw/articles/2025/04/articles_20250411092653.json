As the second most popular sport in the world, cricket is second only to soccer, with over 3 billion fans worldwide. It is significant that cricket comes to the Bay Area, where cricket enjoys a significant fan base.\n\nAs important as the sport is the venue it will be played in: the iconic Oakland Coliseum, which is home to many of Oakland’s best sports memories. From soccer to cricket and beyond, the Oakland Coliseum has become a busy venue.

Presale of tickets began on March 27, and the season will begin on June 12. Ticket sales can be found at https://bit.ly/3R8xr3t\n\nThe iconic, historic Oakland Coliseum is an ideal home for the Unicorns. Some of the greatest moments in sports have happened at the Oakland Coliseum, and the unique shape and size of the field allow for hosting cricket more effectively than other North American sports venues. Hosting such a popular sport as cricket is appropriate for this storied venue.\n\n“We are beyond thrilled to bring the San Francisco Unicorns to the Coliseum for our home matches in 2025,” said David White, CEO of the San Francisco Unicorns. “The Bay Area has a deep and growing love for cricket, and this move allows us to create an unforgettable match day experience in one of the region’s most iconic venues. We can’t wait to welcome fans from across the Bay Area to cheer on the Unicorns in our new home.”\n\nThe Unicorns coming to the Oakland Coliseum is not the only excellent sporting news coming from the Oakland Coliseum in recent weeks. The Oakland Roots SC have just completed their second week at their new home, the Oakland Coliseum. The Roots played to a sold-out crowd on March 22.
