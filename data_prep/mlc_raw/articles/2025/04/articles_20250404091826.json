Losing our captain, losing a couple of players along the way – our players stuck together,” Pooran said after the match.\n\n“I am very proud of everything every individual did, everyone contributed in some way,” he added.\n\nPooran ended as the top run-scorer in the tournament with 388 runs, while Boult (22) had the most wickets.\n\nPooran’s innings won praise from Keiron Pollard who praised his fellow T&T player’s knock.\n\n“Very, very special innings from Nicky P, awesome. All the people that were here and were watching on TV, we get to witness something special,” said Pollard.",
