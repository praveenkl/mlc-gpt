        "body": "Quinton de Kock and Azmatullah Omarzai are among the marquee signings for MI New York (MINY) as they gear up for the 2025 Major League Cricket season with a refreshed and star-studded lineup. De Kock, now a full-time T20 freelancer after retiring from international cricket last year, reunites with the MI franchise for the first time in four years. The 32-year-old was a key part of Mumbai Indians’ IPL title wins in 2019 and 2020, and MINY will be counting on his explosive presence at the top of the order to spark a turnaround after a disappointing bottom-table finish last season.\n\nJoining de Kock is fellow South African George Linde, whose recent success with MI Cape Town in their maiden SA20 triumph has earned him another T20 opportunity within the MI family. Linde will link up with Omarzai, whose stock continues to rise globally—he was recently named ODI Player of the Year. Afghan pacer Naveen-ul-Haq also joins the squad, making the switch from Texas Super Kings to bring additional firepower to MINY’s bowling unit.\n\nThe team has retained its experienced international core: Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran, Trent Boult, and Rashid Khan will once again be central to the squad’s plans. These four have formed the backbone of the team over the last two seasons and will continue to provide leadership and balance.\n\nIPL 2025 Auction: Quinton de Kock for ₹3.6 Crore! KKR’s Top 3 Value Picks Revealed\n\nHowever, some big names have made way. MINY has released Tim David, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, and young talent Dewald Brevis following last year’s underwhelming performance.\n\nOn the domestic front, MINY has also made several changes, signing Indian domestic stars Agni Chopra, Tejinder Dhillon, Sharad Lumba, and Kunwarjeet Singh to bolster their batting depth.\n\nThe 2025 MLC season kicks off on June 12, with matches set to take place on the West Coast for the first time. The iconic Coliseum Stadium in California will host the opening fixtures, marking a new chapter for the league and MI New York alike.",
