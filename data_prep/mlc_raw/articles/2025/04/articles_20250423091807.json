        "body": "For cricket to make a splash in the Bay Area, administrators needed to dream big. They knew the fledgling Major League Cricket, a monthlong T20 tournament played in summer, had to be staged in a venue with deep roots to the region and beyond.\n\nIt may have been seen as grandiose, a pipedream that had shades of a starry-eyed idea for Central Park to host cricket that predictably fell flat, but the iconic Oakland Coliseum had for years been firmly in their sights.\n\nWith good reason. Before these beloved Bay Area institutions fled for the bright lights of Las Vegas, the Athletics and Raiders produced many famous moments on the hallowed Oakland turf.\n\nIt even has pop culture lore. Located near Interstate 880, with its stunning views of the Oakland hills in the backdrop, the old warhorse featured prominently in the critically acclaimed Hollywood blockbuster Moneyball starring Brad Pitt.\n\nOn June 12, with the ground by then converted to the unusual oval-shape dimensions of cricket with a specialised drop-in wicket marking its innards, a new chapter starts for the Coliseum when the San Francisco Unicorns hosts Washington Freedom to launch the third season of MLC.\n\nMore than 12,000 fans are expected in the terraces for what is considered a game-changer for MLC.\n\nForbesMajor League Cricket’s New Season Will Start At The Iconic Oakland Coliseum\n\nBacked by Silicon Valley venture capitalists, the Unicorns’ search far and wide across the Bay Area for a home base has come to an end. Temporarily, at least, with the Coliseum to host three home Unicorns games, nine overall, in a one-season arrangement.\n\nThe Unicorns have certainly made a splash as they build a brand amid the fledgling T20 competition aimed to help grow American cricket - by some metrics the second biggest sport in the world but only a minor game in the U.S.\n\nThe Coliseum announcement was widely reported, including in The New York Times, Axios and mainstream media in the Bay Area.\n\nThe first two seasons of MLC were played in Dallas, the hub of American cricket, and Morrisville in North Carolina but has importantly expanded to the west coast for the first time. The Bay Area, particularly, has a large number of South Asian expats hailing from a region that is fanatical about cricket.\n\n“The Bay Area has the second biggest group of cricket fans in the U.S. behind New York/ New Jersey areas,” Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman told me in a phone interview.\n\n\"But it’s been very hard for people in this area to actually watch the games in the first two seasons with it not being played in the Bay Area.\n\n“It’s hard to connect with the fans if they can’t attend games. We’ve arrived now. We are here. There’s a lot of enthusiasm for the Coliseum and it will help us connect with the Bay Area.”\n\nA lively atmosphere is hoped for the games at the Coliseum, which can hold about 40,000 fans with around a quarter of the capacity tipped as a baseline.\n\n“We are hoping to get big crowds to the stadium,\" Rajaraman said. \"While this area has huge numbers of cricket fans, we only have a short window of time to tell them that the tournament is coming.\n\n“Local marketing and creating awareness is needed. It’s a tremendous opportunity, but also a challenge.”\n\nAmid such a fiercely congested sports market, with the Bay Area home to some of the country’s most famous franchises, battling for sponsorships is fierce.\n\nThe Unicorns have received a big boost ahead of the season after Qualys, a leading provider of cloud-based IT, security, and compliance solutions, was named as its major partner.\n\nQualys will have its logo take prime position on the front of the Unicorns’ match and\n\ntraining jerseys. It is the Unicorns’ most significant commercial partnership to date.\n\nThe MLC games in the East Bay looms as a trial run for the Coliseum with the ballpark recently purchased by African American Sports and Entertainment Group, an Oakland-based group of developers and investors.\n\nThe uncertainty does mean the Unicorns are still scouting locations having previously looked closely at sites in San Jose. “We are keeping our options open only because we don’t know the future of the Oakland Coliseum and the plans of the new owners,” Rajaraman said.\n\nThe games at the Coliseum should be high-octane with the Unicorns set to unleash a squad brimming with youthful talent. Without Australian star players Pat Cummins and Josh Inglis due to Test duties, compatriots Jake Fraser-McGurk and allrounder Cooper Connolly loom as x-factors and drawcards for a Unicorns franchise building around emerging players.\n\nThe 21-year-old Connolly, who has represented Australia across formats, was unveiled as their latest signing on the back of a whirlwind where he was the co-best player of the recent Big Bash League and also made his Test debut in February in Sri Lanka.\n\n“We want to find the young players before they go supernova,” Rajaraman said. “You can build an identity around these players and they bring a lot of excitement to these T20 leagues.”\n\nThe Unicorns are the latest partnership between Rajaraman and co-owner Venky Harinarayan. They were founding partners of early ecommerce company Junglee, which was acquired by AmazonAmazon 0.0% in 1998 for $250 million. They also later founded Kosmix, which was acquired by WalmartWalmart 0.0%, and were early investors in Facebook.\n\n“It (ownership) has been more challenging than I thought, and it’s taken far more time than I thought,” Rajaraman said. \"But it’s part of the early pains for a new league coming together.\n\n“Things are getting exciting. Oakland is close to my heart. I hope we get big crowds for the games there. It would be great if it helps the league and cricket in the Bay Area take the next step.”",

Johnny Grave took over as CEO in 2025, bringing his extensive experience from his previous roles at Cricket West Indies and the Professional Cricketers’ Association in England.\n\nMLC’s decision to set up its base in Texas underscores the growing footprint of cricket in the United States.

This move to Texas showcases the league’s strategic effort to tap into this burgeoning cricket market.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium, the future headquarters, has already played a pivotal role in hosting MLC matches. The stadium, originally a minor league baseball park, was transformed into a cricket venue. It also hosted the T20 World Cup, generating approximately $1.9 million in local economic activity.\n\nAs part of its growth trajectory, Major League Cricket plans to expand from six teams to eight by 2027. The current team roster includes the Texas Super Kings, among others. This expansion is supported by significant investments, with the league raising $120 million in 2022. Notable investors include Anurag Jain, Ross Perot Jr., Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella, Adobe Inc.’s CEO Shantanu Narayen, and Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nLooking ahead, MLC is preparing for its third season, slated to begin in June 2025. With additional plans like introducing cricket to the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028, the league is clearly positioning itself at the forefront of cricket’s international expansion.\n\nIn conclusion, the relocation to Grand Prairie, Texas, is not only a strategic business decision but also a testament to Major League Cricket’s commitment to fostering the sport’s growth in the United States.",

The 37-year-old has officially joined Seattle Orcas for the third edition of Major League Cricket (MLC), set to take place in the USA from June 12 to July 13.\n\nThis marks Warner’s inaugural participation in the MLC, a league that has been gaining traction since its inception in 2023.\n\nWarner, renowned as one of the most explosive batters in T20 history, adds a wealth of experience to the Orcas’ roster. He has participated in 401 T20 matches globally, amassing 12,956 runs at an impressive strike rate of 140.27. With his reputation for aggressive starts and fearless strokeplay, Warner is anticipated to significantly enhance the Orcas' performance at the top of the batting order.\n\nInterestingly, despite being one of the most accomplished players in the IPL—ranking fourth on the all-time run-getters list with 6,565 runs—Warner remained unsold at the IPL 2025 auction. Nonetheless, the southpaw has maintained his form, currently leading Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League and playing a pivotal role in guiding Sydney Thunder to the Big Bash League final earlier this year, where he secured 405 runs in 12 innings. Additionally, he was a crucial member of the title-winning Dubai Capitals squad in the ILT20 this past February.\n\nSeattle Orcas are optimistic that Warner’s addition will turn their fortunes around.

        "body": "Cooper Connolly Signs for San Francisco Unicorns in MLC\n\nCooper Connolly, the rising star in Australian cricket, has officially joined the San Francisco Unicorns in Major League Cricket (MLC). This marks his first foray into an overseas T20 league, signaling a significant step in his burgeoning career. The 21-year-old left-handed batter and left-arm spinner has rapidly made a name for himself, debuting for Australia across all formats since September of last year.\n\nConnolly's Rapid Rise in Cricket\n\nConnolly's journey to this point has been remarkable. Here’s a breakdown of his key milestones:\n\nBBL Breakthrough: He burst onto the scene in the 2022-23 Big Bash League (BBL), playing a pivotal role in leading the Perth Scorchers to the championship title in just his fourth match and second innings.\n\nInternational Debut: He made his T20 International (T20I) debut against Scotland last year. While appearances have been limited due to a thumb injury, his potential remains undeniable.\n\nImpressive BBL Performance: Connolly showcased his talent in the 2024-25 BBL season, scoring 351 runs at an impressive average of 50.14 and a strike rate of 131.46. This outstanding performance earned him a joint player-of-the-tournament award alongside Glenn Maxwell.\n\nTest Debut: Connolly debuted in a Test match against Sri Lanka in February, solidifying his place in Australian cricket.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns and Shane Watson's Perspective\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns, coached by former Australian all-rounder Shane Watson, are excited to welcome Connolly to their squad. Watson lauded Connolly's abilities, stating, 'Cooper's all-round ability is going to be a key asset for the Unicorns this summer.' He further emphasized Connolly's maturity and adaptability, noting that few players possess international experience across both white-ball formats and have earned a baggy green at such a young age.\n\nMLC, Future Tours, and T20 World Cup Aspirations\n\nThe timing of Connolly’s MLC stint coincides with Australia’s Test tour of the West Indies. While his involvement in the Test series is unlikely, the MLC provides valuable experience. Following the conclusion of MLC, Australia will play five T20Is, serving as preparation for the 2024 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.

        "body": "Heinrich Klaasen was the major omission on the Cricket SA contracted players list announced on Monday.\n\nKlaasen is arguably the most sought after white-ball batter in the world currently, with the explosive right-hander currently on a close to R50 million contract with Indian Premier League team Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nThe 33-year-old is also contracted to Durban’s Super Giants in the Betway SA20 and Seattle Orcas at Major League Cricket in the United States.\n\nCricket SA said in a statement on Monday that “discussions regarding Heinrich Klaasen’s future are ongoing, and a final decision will be made in due course.”\n\nThe global cricket landscape has drastically changed over the last couple of years with leading New Zealand players such as Kane Williamson and Trent Boult turning down national contracts to pursue opportunities in T20 Leagues around the world while remaining available to the Black Caps.\n\nLeading Australian white-ball players such as Marcus Stoinis, Ashton Agar, Jason Behrendorff and Andrew Tye have also recently dropped off Cricket Australia’s contracted players list.\n\nLast season, the Proteas had already seen wrist-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi and fast bowler Anrich Nortje opt out of their national contracts. They were not included on the 18-player list for the new 2025/26 season.\n\nHowever, Cricket SA have broken new ground by offering both David Miller and Rassie van der Dussen “hybrid contracts” that will see the veteran duo participate in specific agreed-upon bilateral tours and ICC events.\n\n“The hybrid contracts take into consideration the dynamic nature of modern-day cricket and will provide David and Rassie with the opportunity to contribute to the team during specific bilateral tours and ICC events,” said Director of National Teams and High Performance Enoch Nkwe.\n\nThe calendar will also feature two major ICC events: the World Test Championship (WTC) Final against Australia, which will take place at Lord’s in England in June, and the T20 World Cup 2026, to be played in India and Sri Lanka early next year.\n\n“All of these players have been contracted with the importance of the next World Test Championship cycle and the 2027 Cricket World Cup on home soil in mind,” Nkwe said.\n\n\"An exciting season awaits as we compete for the WTC mace and look to take one step further in next year’s T20 World Cup. We wish all the contracted players the very best for the year ahead.”\n\nProteas Men’s Contracted Squad 2025/26\n\nTemba Bavuma (Lions), David Bedingham (Western Province), Nandre Burger (Western Province), Gerald Coetzee (Titans), Tony de Zorzi (Western Province), Reeza Hendricks (Lions), Marco Jansen (North West Dragons), Keshav Maharaj (Dolphins), Kwena Maphaka (Lions), Aiden Markram (Titans), Wiaan Mulder (Lions), Senuran Muthusamy (Warriors), Lungi Ngidi (Titans), Kagiso Rabada (Lions), Ryan Rickelton (Lions), Tristan Stubbs (Warriors), Kyle Verreynne (Western Province), and Lizaad Williams (Titans).\n\nHybrid Contracts 2025/26\n\nDavid Miller (Dolphins) and Rassie van der Dussen (Lions).",
