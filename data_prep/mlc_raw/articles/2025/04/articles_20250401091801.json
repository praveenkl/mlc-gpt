        "body": "This week’s press conference at the Oakland Coliseum marked a new chapter for one of the most iconic venues in Bay Area sports history. Cricket, the world’s second most watched sport, is coming to the Coliseum, through a landmark partnership with Major League Cricket, or MLC.\n\nJohnny Grave is the CEO of MLC. He spoke about what it took to bring Big League Cricket here. “It was three years ago, in June, that I was here with members of the International Cricket Council trying to bring the World Cup here. So, it's fantastic for me and for the sport of Cricket to finally be here. To formally announce that Cricket will come to the Oakland Coliseum. In June on the 12th for a week of what will be the most exciting Cricket you can watch in this country.”\n\nBut what does this moment mean more for long time Oakland fans?\n\nThe A’s have left. The Warriors left Oracle for San Francisco. The Raiders are long gone and now play in Las Vegas.\n\nAccording to City Council member Rebecca Kaplan, Cricket is a new beginning for Oakland and the coliseum. “Welcome to the Oakland Resurrection. People said that this facility was going to be dead. Here we are, just three months after the last lease ended and it is alive and thriving. We had over 26,000 people here at the Oakland Coliseum on Saturday for Root soccer. Let's give Root soccer some love.”\n\nWhether you're a fan or not, this seems beneficial for Oakland’s economy.\n\nInterim Mayor Kevin Jenkins had this to say. “This site was left by a number of sports teams, but what this means is a revitalization of our economy, especially with this site that's right here in East Oakland. What it means is when this site does well, Oakland does well. We recently reopened fire stations with extra revenue from the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum.”\n\nSo, maybe cricket is more than just a new sport here. Maybe it’s a lifeline. A way to reimagine what the Coliseum can be, to build new memories on old turf.",
        "summary": "* The Oakland Coliseum will host a week of Major League Cricket (MLC) matches from June 12th, marking a new chapter for the iconic venue.\n* The MLC CEO, Johnny Grave, announced the partnership, which is a culmination of a three-year effort to bring cricket to the Coliseum.\n* The tournament is expected to be an exciting event for cricket fans in the country.\n* The arrival of MLC is seen as a positive development for Oakland's economy, which has been affected by the departure of other sports teams from the Coliseum.\n* The event is expected to revitalize the local economy, particularly in East Oakland, and generate revenue for the city."

        "body": "The Oakland Coliseum is set to make history in 2025 as it welcomes Major League Cricket (MLC), becoming the latest venue in the U.S. to embrace the growing sport. The stadium will host nine matches, starting with the season opener on June 12, and will serve as the long-awaited home ground for the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nThe historic venue, once home to Major League Baseball’s Oakland Athletics and the NFL’s Oakland Raiders, will undergo modifications to accommodate cricket. Plans include installing drop-in pitches and reducing seating capacity to 12,000.\n\nCricket’s expansion in the U.S.\n\nSince its launch in 2023, MLC has steadily expanded, with matches previously held in Texas and Florida. The addition of the Oakland Coliseum is another step in the league’s growth.\n\n“The Coliseum is a fantastic location for Major League Cricket, and we are thrilled by the prospect of some of the world’s biggest cricket stars playing in such an iconic Californian venue,” said MLC chief executive Johnny Grave.\n\nMLC’s third season will see six teams—San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas, New York, and Washington D.C.—compete in a month-long tournament. The league’s T20 format, lasting approximately 3.5 hours, is designed to appeal to American sports audiences.\n\nGrowing cricket culture in the Bay Area\n\nThe Bay Area is home to the second-largest cricket fan base in the U.S., with many fans of South Asian descent. Local cricket enthusiast Omer Chaudhary, who grew up playing in Pakistan, expressed excitement about having professional cricket close to home.\n\n“It used to be hard to watch cricket in the U.S. Now, we can go see a match at the Coliseum,” said Chaudhary, wearing a Pakistan team jersey. “With Bay Area teams leaving or struggling, this is a refreshing addition to the sports scene.”\n\nMLC’s arrival follows the Oakland Roots football club, which recently played its first match at the Coliseum. With cricket and football now part of the venue’s legacy, the stadium becomes the first in North America to host two of the world’s most popular sports.\n\nShort-Term Deal, Long-Term Hopes\n\nMLC has signed a one-year contract with Oakland due to uncertainty surrounding the stadium’s future. However, the deal is expected to generate $3 million in revenue for a city facing financial challenges.\n\nInterim Oakland Mayor Kevin Jenkins highlighted the importance of the Coliseum’s revenue streams, saying, “These past few years, the Coliseum and arena have done very well, allowing us to reinvest in public services.”\n\nLooking ahead, MLC aims to build momentum leading up to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will return to the Games. With top players earning upwards of $80,000 for the season, the league hopes to establish itself as a major force in American sports.\n\nMLC’s season begins on June 12, with tickets going on sale Thursday.",
