We see America as such a huge market from a sports perspective.”\n\nWeenink said NZC sees cricket “really taking off” in the United States on the back of the T20 Cricket World Cup, which the U.S. co-hosted last year, as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n“So we really want to tap into and jump on board the huge growth opportunity that Major League Cricket offers,” he said. “As franchise cricket grows globally, NZC needs to adapt to seize strategic opportunities that ensure the sustainability of our cricket network.\n\n“This helps diversify our revenue streams, expands our global brand and fan base and creates new talent development and retention pathways for both our players and coaches.”\n\nSeveral leading New Zealand players already have played in MLC and NZC hopes an association with the U.S. tournament will provide a new pathway for young and senior players.\n\nThe 2025 MLC season will be played within the space of a month in June with salaries of up to $200,000 being paid to top players. The short duration of the competition makes it particularly lucrative and attractive.\n\n___\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket\n\nSteve Mcmorran, The Associated Press",

        "date": "Wed Apr 23 17:00:44 2025",
        "body": "New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has become the first national governing body to invest directly in an overseas T20 league after joining forces with Major League Cricket (MLC) to launch one of the competition's new teams in 2027.\n\nAs reported by ESPNcricinfo, MLC will increase from its current six teams to eight in 2027, and there are ambitions to grow further by 2031, with the possibility a franchise could be based in Canada.\n\nThe terms have been agreed, and NZC has become investors, with US-based True North Sports (TNS), which will be run by MLC co-founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, to operate one of the new franchises. A NZC statement said that among the private equity investors in TNS are 49ers Enterprises, the investment arm of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers.\n\nNZC will therefore part-own the team - with an option to invest in a second franchise at a later date - while also providing high-performance and operational support, including coaching, management and support staff, which it will be paid for, as well as integrating the franchise into New Zealand's domestic high-performance system. In a second phase of development, NZC will provide expertise in cricket infrastructure and turf management.\n\nNew South Wales and Victoria partnered with Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns respectively at the initial launch of MLC in 2023, but the depth of NZC's deal goes significantly further.\n\nScott Weenink, the NZC chief executive, said it was vital that the sport looked beyond traditional sources of income amid the rapidly changing landscape.\n\n\"We put in place a five-year strategic plan in the middle of last year and one of the things that came clearly out of that was the need to try and diversify away from a reliance on just broadcast revenue and ICC distributions,\" Weenink told ESPNcricinfo. \"New Zealand Cricket, like most member boards, is heavily reliant on those two aspects.\n\n\"At the moment, we don't have our own franchise cricket tournament. We have the Super Smash, which we own, and is seen more as a tournament to help develop Black Caps and White Ferns. And we're currently looking at what we do with that, but also part of our strategic plan was looking to diversify our revenue streams to pay for and invest in our high-performance community and pathways. One of which was looking at what we did with overseas domestic franchises.\"\n\nWeenink added that growing the NZC and players' brand in India remained vital, but that the potential growth of the game in the US - including the hosting of the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles where cricket will return - made MLC an attractive proposition. There is also a timezone advantage with evening games from the US being broadcast in the middle of day in New Zealand rather than during the night.\n\nHe expected the new franchise to have a \"heavy New Zealand influence\" but the country's players would be free to join any team in the competition. For centrally contracted players, international duty would continue to take precedence.\n\nWeenink also said that the move did not mean the governing body was taking any of its focus away from the game in New Zealand.\n\n\"It's additional funding and revenue, which we will then be able to invest in our high-performance community and pathways game in New Zealand,\" he said. \"We don't see by making this investment in an overseas league as meaning we're not going to invest further in our own Super Smash, or other leagues. We see this as complementary because we see it as an opportunity to generate revenue, to enable us to actually invest in our network, and in particular, our leagues.\"\n\nIn terms of the Super Smash, which is usually played from late December to early February, Weenink said various options remained on the table including private investment. There is also the potential for providing a team in the BBL should the tournament in Australia expand. The BBL is set to undergo a review, led by Boston Consulting Group, to assess its future options.\n\nCummins: MLC is giving cricketers a platform in the US\n\nThe Australia Test captain speaks about his first taste of Major League Cricket\n\n\"We have had informal talks with Cricket Australia about potentially putting a team in the Big Bash,\" Weenink said. \"And that's certainly, if we're both in agreement, something that we would consider. But as well as looking at that and considering some options there, we are actively considering what we should do with our Super Smash. Because we've actually been able to generate good revenue from broadcasting and also ICC distributions, we haven't necessarily needed to do anything like privatise the Super Smash.\n\n\"But there is obviously a recognition that broadcasting and ICC distributions will potentially come under pressure. So we need to look at alternative things, including do we privatise our own Super Smash? Certainly all those things are being considered as part of our longer-term strategic thinking.\"\n\nFurther details of the NZC-backed franchise, including its name, are expected to be announced later this year.\n\n\"TNS is delighted to partner with NZC, an organisation admired for its sustained success despite limited financial and playing resources compared to other international cricketing bodies,\" Mehta said. \"As founders of start-ups that have rapidly grown to established businesses, we see NZC as a perfect fit for our new franchise.

This marks a significant step as it represents the first time a full ICC member has partnered directly with a franchise in a top-tier professional cricket league.\n\nThe initiative will see NZC contribute extensive high-performance and operational support, including the provision of coaching, management, and staff, integrating this new franchise into NZC's domestic high-performance framework.\n\nFollowing this initial phase, NZC plans to extend its support to include expertise in cricket infrastructure and turf management. In a move that underscores the depth of this partnership, NZC has also become a foundational investor in TNS.\n\nThis opens the door for NZC to potentially make a more significant equity investment by the end of 2025. This venture represents a novel approach, with NZC investing in an overseas franchise team, a move not previously seen in the world of cricket.\n\nThis development comes at a time when the financial sustainability of cricket boards has been a topic of much discussion. The announcement was made shortly after Richard Gould, chair of the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB), highlighted the financial challenges faced by most cricket boards, pointing out that only a handful are financially sustainable through their domestic cricket markets alone.\n\nInterestingly, the ECB had, until recently, held a significant stake in each of The Hundred franchises, which has now been sold to various bidders, including owners of IPL franchises.\n\nAdding to the broader context of cricket's evolving business landscape, Lancashire CEO Daniel Gidney had suggested that the ECB consider offering stakes in The Hundred to the BCCI to attract Indian players to the league. This proposal indicates a growing interest in cross-border investments and collaborations in cricket.\n\nNZC's Strategic Move into North America's Lucrative Market\n\nScott Weenink, the CEO of NZC, emphasized the strategic importance of entering the North American market, known for its vast potential in the sports industry. \"We saw this as an opportunity to build on international cricket by bringing our international expertise into a domestic franchise arrangement,\" Weenink explained.\n\nHe further highlighted the compatibility of international and franchise cricket, suggesting that the venture is not just about expansion but also about managing the coexistence of different formats of the game.\n\nWeenink's vision extends to leveraging this opportunity to enhance the global reach of New Zealand cricket and its players, targeting growth in both the Indian and North American markets, which he describes as incredibly lucrative.\n\nThis strategic move by NZC to operate an MLC franchise from 2027 and invest in an overseas franchise team is a bold step, reflecting the changing dynamics of global cricket governance and the search for new revenue streams.\n\nAs cricket boards explore innovative ways to ensure financial sustainability and expand their global footprint, partnerships like the one between NZC and TNS could pave the way for future collaborations in the sport.",

New Zealand Cricket (NZC) is stepping into new territory (quite literally).\n\nIt’s set to become the first full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) to launch a cricket team in another country’s league.\n\nThis new team will be part of Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States, starting in 2027, and it’s a big deal for both New Zealand cricket and the sport globally.\n\nHere’s the full story.\n\nWhat Is Major League Cricket?\n\nMLC is a professional T20 cricket league in the US. It started in 2023 and is growing fast.\n\nIt runs for about four weeks in the summer (June and July) and already features big names like Steve Smith, Pat Cummins, Trent Boult, Matt Henry, Rachin Ravindra, and more.\n\nThe league currently has 6 teams, but by 2027 it’ll expand to 8, and by 2031, there could be 10.\n\nCricket in the US is also getting a big boost thanks to:\n\nThe 2024 T20 World Cup, which included matches in the US\n\nCricket becoming a medal sport at the 2028 LA Olympics\n\nAn estimated 25 million cricket fans in North America\n\nThat’s a lot of people who could soon be watching New Zealand players more closely.\n\nWhat’s Happening?\n\nNZC has teamed up with True North Sports Ventures (TNS), a US-based sports investment group, to create a brand new team in the MLC.\n\nNot only that, but NZC is also putting money into TNS as a founding partner, with the option to invest even more by the end of 2025.\n\nThis team will be based either in Atlanta or Toronto; cities with large communities who already love cricket.\n\nWhy Is This Important?\n\nThere are a few big reasons this matters:\n\nFirst of its kind: No other ICC full member has ever done this before. NZC is leading the way.\n\nPlayer support: NZC isn’t just lending its name. It’ll be sending over coaches, managers, and support staff, and will even connect the new team with its training programs back home.\n\nKeeping Kiwi players: Many New Zealand stars are choosing to play in T20 leagues around the world rather than for the national team. This move gives them a good reason to stay connected with NZC while still earning big.\n\nWhy Did NZC Do This?\n\nLook, it’s not just about spreading the sport. This is smart business.\n\nIn the words of NZC CEO Scott Weenink:\n\n“As franchise cricket grows globally, we need to adapt… This helps diversify our revenue, grow our brand, and keep our best players involved with New Zealand cricket.”\n\nBLACKCAPS | Hear from CEO Scott Weenink on New Zealand Cricket’s partnership with US-based company True North Sports Ventures to launch a new Major… | Instagram\n\nAnd he’s got a point. With T20 leagues offering huge paydays, top Kiwi players have been turning down national contracts.\n\nMLC salaries can go up to $200,000 for just five matches — nearly double what NZC pays in a full season.\n\nSo, owning a slice of MLC doesn’t just open new doors — it might help keep the Black Caps together.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nThe team doesn’t have a name or city yet; that will be announced later. But NZC is already planning for the future. If this first team goes well, they might back a second MLC team in 2031.\n\nsource: aljazeera\n\nThis move puts NZC in great company. TNS is supported by major sports investors like 49ers Enterprises, the investment arm of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThat means NZC is now part of a global sports business network. One that includes top football and cricket brands.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWell, this move could shake up international cricket. If NZC can pull this off, don’t be surprised if Australia, India, or England follow suit.\n\nSo next time you hear someone say cricket is just for the Commonwealth, hit them with this: ‘’New Zealand is building a cricket empire… in America.’’\n\nAnd as a New Zealand cricket fan for nearly 10 years now, I can’t wait to see what’s next. It might just change how national cricket boards work with global T20 leagues in the future.",

According to him, \"I think it's possible. If I was the ECB, I'd be talking about perhaps bringing the BCCI in as a minority ownership partner in the tournament as a whole. If you do that, then you are aligning interests.\"\n\nThe BCCI has been really successful with protecting their brand by making sure they don't plan any T20 tournaments anywhere in the world… If I were the BCCI, then I would have to say I would need a significant incentive to relax the current policy because that has been extraordinarily successful and has grown the IPL into the massive commercial entity that it is,\" he added.\n\nProposal for a possible bridge between BCCI and ECB\n\nThough Indian men's cricketers are not allowed to play any foreign club cricket, the country's women cricketers, like captain Harmanpreet Kaur and Smriti Mandhana, featured in England's The Hundred and Australia's Women's Big Bash League.
