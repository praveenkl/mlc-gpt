        "body": "David Warner, a former opener for Australia, has signed with the Seattle Orcas for the 2025 Major League Cricket (MLC) season. This will be his first time playing in the USA-based T20 league.\n\nThe third season of MLC will start on June 12, 2025, and Warner’s addition gives the game more star power. Fans can stay updated on the latest MLC news and player performances through platforms like the Bpexch App, which offers real-time cricket insights and updates.\n\nWarner is still one of the most sought-after T20 players in franchise leagues around the world, even though he quit international cricket in June 2024. He is currently captaining the Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), which shows how good a leader he is and how good a batsman he is.\n\nWarner’s Great T20 Career\n\nWarner has played in 401 T20 matches and scored 12,956 runs at a very good strike rate of 140.27. Because he bats aggressively and has a lot of knowledge, he is a great asset to any T20 team.\n\nWarner is still one of the best players in IPL history, even though he wasn’t sold in the IPL 2025 sale. With 6,565 runs in 184 innings, he is the fourth-best run scorer in the event. It was strange that he wasn’t in the IPL this year, but he quickly made a mark somewhere else.\n\nHow Well The Big Bash League (BBL) Did\n\nWarner came back to the Big Bash League (BBL) as captain of the Sydney Thunder for the 2024–25 season. The Thunder made it to the finals with Warner’s leadership, and he scored 405 runs in 12 innings, which was second most in the event.\n\nDubai Capitals Wins the ILT20\n\nWarner was on the team from Dubai Capitals that won the International League T20 (ILT20) title in February of this year. His hitting and experience in games with a lot of pressure were very important to their title run.\n\nSo Far on the Seattle Orcas’ MLC Journey\n\nIn the first season of the MLC (2023), the Seattle Orcas got off to a good start and won all of their games. In the end, though, MI New York beat them. The Orcas had a bad season in 2024. They came last and only won one of their seven games while Heinrich Klaasen was captain.\n\nWith Warner on board, there is hope for a change. If the Orcas want to get back to the top of the MLC, his ability to lead and hit the ball hard could be the missing pieces.\n\nSchedule for MLC 2025 and Warner’s Availability\n\nIn 2025, the MLC season will last from June 12 to July 13. This will make for a month-long T20 show in the USA. The event will not happen at the same time as The Hundred as it did last year. Warner will be playing for the London Spirit in The Hundred. Warner can play in both games without any overlap, thanks to this schedule.\n\nWhat Warner Brings to the Seattle Orcas: Powerful hitting; Warner is a game-changer because he can control power plays and center innings.\n\nLeadership Experience: Warner will be very useful because he has led teams in the IPL, BBL, and PSL.\n\nWinning Mentality: His track record of winning various T20 leagues (IPL, BBL, and ILT20) will serve as an inspiration to the Orcas team.\n\nGlobal Fan Following—Warner’s appearance will bring in more viewers and get fans more involved with MLC.\n\nTo read More blog: Exploring Online Cricket ID and Online Betting ID on Amiribook\n\nThat’s it! A huge boost for MLC.\n\nIt’s a big deal for Major League Cricket that David Warner signed with the Seattle Orcas. His fame and skill on the pitch will help the league become more famous in the US. Warner will try to add another prize to his already impressive career when he takes the pitch in MLC 2025. Fans can expect fireworks.",
