        "title": "Nicholas Pooran Named Wisden’s Leading T20 Cricketer In The World",
        "date": "Mon Apr 21 21:30:00 2025",
        "body": "Nicholas Pooran has described himself as a “child of T20”, but in 2024 he became a true disciple, playing 76 games in the format – roughly one every five days – and piling up more runs and sixes than anyone had ever managed in a calendar year. An example of his commitment to the globe-trotting gig economy came in July, when he arrived in Leeds for Northern Superchargers’ opening fixture of The Hundred, less than 48 hours after his MI New York team had been knocked out of the Major League Cricket play-offs. Pooran’s luggage couldn’t keep up with the schedule, so he borrowed a bat from Phil Salt (who played for Manchester Originals, but shared a sponsor).\n\nIn late 2023, Pooran had declined a West Indies central contract, sowing the seeds for his bumper harvest. His year began with three games in five days for Durban’s Super Giants at the SA20, before helping MI Emirates to success in the ILT20 (either side of three T20 Internationals in Australia). Then it was Bangladesh for a couple of games with Rangpur Riders, a full IPL season with Lucknow Super Giants (where he averaged 62, at a strike-rate of 178), and a home T20 World Cup. That was followed by MLC and The Hundred, three matches in Trinidad against South Africa, and 11 for Trinbago Knight Riders in the CPL. (We haven’t even mentioned the Abu Dhabi T10, where he won another title, with Deccan Gladiators.)\n\nThe raw numbers explained Pooran’s popularity: 2,331 runs at an average of 40 put him out on his own; Reeza Hendricks, second in the list, made 1,970. And Pooran comfortably eclipsed Mohammad Rizwan’s T20 record for a calendar year of 2,036. Even more stark was Pooran’s six-hitting ability: 170, one every 8.7 balls, was 65 clear of the next best, Heinrich Klaasen. He soared past the previous high-water mark of 135, set by Chris Gayle in 2015. During the World Cup, Pooran also overtook him as West Indies’ leading T20 run-scorer and six-hitter. Where Gayle was a path-breaking juggernaut, Pooran’s virtuosity lay in assessing the situation, whether at No.3 or finishing the innings at No.5. His 98 from 53 balls against Afghanistan in St Lucia provided a perfect demonstration of his range and tactical awareness: he raced to 36 off 13 during the powerplay, throttled back for 18 off 26 during the middle overs, then crashed 44 from 14 from the last four. The child of T20 had become its main man, though Pooran’s evolution was far from done. “Whatever the best version of myself is, it’s yet to come,” he said.",
        "summary": "* Nicholas Pooran played for MI New York in the MLC play-offs.\n* Pooran's team, MI New York, was knocked out of the MLC play-offs in 2024.\n* Pooran had to travel to Leeds for The Hundred immediately after being eliminated from the MLC play-offs, arriving less than 48 hours later.\n\nNote that the article does not provide more information about the MLC tournament, its format, or Pooran's performance in the tournament beyond the mentioned facts."

        "date": "Sat Apr 19 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "In a significant move ahead of the upcoming Major League Cricket (MLC) season, former Australian cricket opener David Warner has joined the Seattle Orcas. Warner’s inclusion is expected to bolster the team for the third edition of MLC, slated to commence on June 12 and conclude on July 13, 2025.\n\nDavid Warner, renowned for his aggressive batting style, is set to bring a wealth of experience to the Seattle Orcas. Throughout his illustrious T20 career, Warner has participated in 401 matches, amassing a formidable 12,956 runs with a striking rate of 140.27. Despite his impressive credentials, Warner will be missing the IPL 2025 season after going unsold in the mega auction, marking his first absence from the league since 2009. However, he remains the fourth-highest run-scorer in IPL history, tallying 6,565 runs from 184 innings.\n\nCurrently, Warner is leading the Karachi Kings in the ongoing Pakistan Super League 2025. Additionally, there’s no scheduling conflict with The Hundred tournament in 2025, which allows Warner to also play for the London Spirit later this year. His versatility and leadership have been evident globally, recently contributing to Sydney Thunder’s journey to the final in the Big Bash League and Dubai Capitals’ triumphant ILT20 campaign in 2025.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas have high expectations from Warner’s presence, as they look to improve their standings in MLC. Although the Orcas topped the points table during the inaugural 2023 season, they fell short in the final against MI New York. In contrast, their performance in the second season dipped significantly, finishing at the bottom with just a single victory in seven matches under Heinrich Klaasen’s captaincy.\n\nDavid Warner’s signing marks a strategic move by the Seattle Orcas as they aim to revitalize their MLC campaign and achieve better results in the 2025 edition. His experience and skills are anticipated to be instrumental in turning around the fortunes of the team and aiming for the championship.",

Earlier in 2025, he played a crucial role in helping the Dubai Capitals win their first ILT20 title.\n\nBefore joining the Seattle Orcas for the MLC season, Warner will be leading Karachi Kings in the upcoming Pakistan Super League (PSL) season. This role will further add to his leadership experience and bring momentum to his game ahead of the MLC season.\n\nMajor League Cricket was established in 2019 by American Cricket Enterprises in the United States.
