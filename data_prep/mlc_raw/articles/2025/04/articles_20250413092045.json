        "date": "Fri Apr 11 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "As we all know cricket has traditionally been dominated by the major Test playing nations. Countries like India, England, Australia, and South Africa have traditionally been the dominant forces.\n\nSlowly but surely however new nations are starting to make their mark as countries like Afghanistan and Ireland enter the fray. Another nation starting to make an impact is America, thanks in part to the advent of Major League Cricket.\n\nLaunched in 2023, MLC has brought international attention and star power to American cricket. While much of the buzz surrounds overseas players like Faf du Plessis, Nicholas Pooran, and Rashid Khan, the real heartbeat of MLC lies in the emergence of genuine homegrown talent.\n\nSeveral players born and raised in the United States have begun to carve out reputations as top-tier professionals – not just in the domestic setup, but also against international stars.\n\nWith the new season of Major League Cricket starting to raise its head on the horizon, let’s take a moment to uncover some of the more prominent U.S. born cricketers who’ve made an impact in Major League Cricket so far.\n\n1. Steven Taylor (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nBorn: Florida, USA\n\nSteven Taylor is arguably the face of U.S.-born cricket talent. A hard-hitting left-handed opener, Taylor brings flair and aggression to the top of the order — something MLC fans have seen plenty of while he’s represented the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nTaylor has been on the radar for a long time, having made his debut for the United States of America national cricket team in 2010. He also had stints in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) with the Jamaica Tallawahs and Guyana Amazon Warriors.\n\nIn MLC, he’s provided fast starts and key breakthroughs with his off spin. As one of the most seasoned American-born cricketers, Taylor continues to be a cornerstone of the domestic game. Still only 31 he averages 31,61 in T20Is.\n\n2. Ali Khan (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nBorn: New York, USA\n\nAli Khan may be best known for his heroics in the Caribbean Premier League and brief IPL stint with the Kolkata Knight Riders, but he was born in New York and has gone on to represent the United States at international level.\n\nA fiery fast bowler with an eye for yorkers and bouncers, Khan is the kind of player who adds x-factor to any T20 side. His presence in the MLC — especially with a big-name franchise like the LA Knight Riders — provides star appeal and valuable pace-bowling depth.\n\nAlso read: Major League Cricket in USA already has an impressive list of top 7 wicket-takers in its short history\n\n3. Sushant Modani (Texas Super Kings)\n\nBorn: New Jersey, USA\n\nSushant Modani has quietly built a reputation as one of the most consistent middle-order batsmen in the U.S. cricket structure. While not the most explosive player in the league, Modani brings a touch of solidity and composure that’s often needed in pressure moments.\n\nPlaying for the Texas Super Kings, Modani has shown he can rotate the strike, anchor an innings, and find the boundary when needed. His calm temperament is well-suited to the demands of T20 cricket, and he’s viewed as a valuable asset who can fill multiple roles.\n\n4. Jessy Singh (Texas Super Kings)\n\nBorn: New Jersey, USA\n\nAnother true American-born player, Jessy Singh is a pace-bowling all-rounder with a growing profile. He’s played for the U.S. national team and was picked up by the Texas Super Kings in MLC, where he impressed with his tight lines and deceptive slower balls.\n\nSingh also contributes with the bat in the lower order and has proved useful in high-pressure situations. His physicality and competitive edge make him a promising domestic player with potential for further growth.\n\n5. Nisarg Patel (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nBorn: Anaheim, California\n\nA left-arm orthodox spinner with international experience for USA cricket, Nisarg Patel has quietly emerged as one of the more effective American bowlers in the shorter formats. His role in MLC has largely been to stifle batters during the middle overs, which he does with sharp angles and a calm head.\n\nPatel’s ability to control the run rate and build pressure allows teams to attack at the other end — a role he has performed well for the LA Knight Riders. He’s also a handy lower-order batsman.\n\n6. Kyle Phillip (MI New York)\n\nBorn: Brooklyn, New York\n\nAn athletic fast bowler with a smooth action, Kyle Phillip has been one of the more promising American quicks in the MLC setup. Representing MI New York, he’s bowled with pace and aggression, often taking the new ball and setting the tone.\n\nThough Phillip has faced challenges with consistency, his raw talent and homegrown status make him one of the most exciting prospects in the U.S. system.",
        "summary": "The article highlights the emergence of homegrown talent in the United States through the MLC, which was launched in 2023. It features six prominent U.S.-born cricketers who have made an impact in the tournament:\n\n1. Steven Taylor (Los Angeles Knight Riders) - a hard-hitting left-handed opener who has been on the radar since 2010.\n2.

        "title": "Most wickets in Major League Cricket",
        "date": "Sat Apr 12 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "As Major League Cricket prepares for its third season – the action starts again in mid-June – it’s time to take a moment to recall some of the standout performances from the tournament’s first two seasons.\n\nIt’s true that Major League Cricket is not the pinnacle of the franchise cricket game, but it is nevertheless a league that attracts big-name players and has the capacity to grow the game’s global following.\n\nWhile power-hitting and huge sixes have often dominated the headlines in T20 cricket, bowlers still remain vital to winning matches – especially those who can deliver under pressure in the powerplay or at the death.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s delve into the statistics and see which players have taken the most wickets since the inception of Major League Cricket two seasons ago.\n\n7. Harmeet Singh (Seattle Orcas): 15 wickets from 13 MLC matches\n\nFew players have become as important to the development of cricket in the U.S. as Harmeet Singh. The left-arm spinner has emerged as a dependable force for the Seattle Orcas with both control and subtle variations.\n\nHis ability to keep things tight in the middle overs while also picking up timely wickets has made him a crucial cog in the Orcas’ bowling attack. Harmeet’s experience in domestic cricket, both in India and the U.S., has served him well, and he’s one of the local names to keep an eye on in the years ahead.\n\n6. Andrew Tye (Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom): 16 wickets from 9 MLC matches\n\nKnown worldwide for his knuckle balls and death-over expertise, Andrew Tye has lived up to his reputation in Major League Cricket. Splitting time between the Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom, the Australia quick has shown he still has plenty to offer in franchise T20s.\n\nHis knack for deceiving batters with pace off deliveries and bowling with intelligence in high-pressure situations makes his 16 wickets from just 9 matches all the more impressive.\n\nTye’s performances have provided an excellent example for young American bowlers looking to develop their T20 skills.\n\nAlso read: Who is the only overseas player among the top 9 batters with the most runs in Pakistan Super League?\n\n5. Marco Jansen (Washington Freedom) – 18 wickets from 14 MLC matches\n\nThe tall South Africa left-armer, Marco Jansen, has become a mainstay of the Washington Freedom bowling lineup. With bounce, swing, and top-level pace, Jansen brings the kind of threat few batters enjoy facing — especially in U.S. conditions where seam movement can play a part.\n\nHis ability to strike early in the innings and return at the death makes him a valuable asset. Though his average is slightly higher than others in the top seven, Jansen’s versatility and batting abilities ensure he remains a key weapon in the Freedom’s arsenal.\n\n4. Rashid Khan (MI New York) – 18 wickets from 13 MLC matches\n\nThere’s hardly a T20 league in the world where Rashid Khan hasn’t made an impact, and MLC is no exception. Representing MI New York, the Afghan leg-spinner has mesmerized batters with his signature googlies and fast-paced variations.\n\nRashid’s economy rate might not always make headlines, but his ability to break partnerships and disrupt rhythm has been instrumental in MI New York’s success. His 18 wickets in 13 games highlight his consistency, and the crowds in America have embraced one of the modern greats of the format.\n\n3. Cameron Gannon (Seattle Orcas) – 22 wickets from 14 MLC matches\n\nA U.S.-qualified player with experience in Australia’s Big Bash League, Cameron Gannon has taken on the role of senior statesman in the Seattle Orcas pace attack. At 6’6″, Gannon uses his height to generate bounce, and his ability to hit hard lengths and keep things simple has reaped rewards.\n\nWith 22 wickets from 14 matches, he’s proven himself as not just a handy bowler in American conditions, but also a key leader among the domestic players in the squad. His performances are a promising sign of MLC’s local talent pool taking shape.\n\n2. Saurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom) – 25 wickets from 13 MLC matches\n\nPossibly the most heartwarming success story of MLC so far, Saurabh Netravalkar has gone from former India U19 star to a central figure in the rise of American cricket.\n\nNow a regular in the U.S. national side and a leader for Washington Freedom, the left-arm seamer combines swing, control, and excellent discipline. His stunning average of just 14.44 — across 25 wickets in 13 games — underlines his impact.\n\nNetravalkar may not have the headline-grabbing profile of others on this list, but he has been among the most effective bowlers in the league.\n\n1. Trent Boult (MI New York) – 31 wickets from 15 MLC matches\n\nTrent Boult is arguably the most decorated bowler to have graced MLC so far, and he has absolutely lived up to the hype.\n\nThe left-arm New Zealand star is a master of swing, especially in the powerplay, and his early breakthroughs have given MI New York an edge in almost every game he’s played.\n\nHis strike rate is outstanding, and he often sets the tone for his side with the new ball. With 31 wickets from just 15 matches, Boult leads the wicket charts – a true reflection of his class and continued excellence in T20 cricket.",
