Six teams will be participating in this major championship.\n\nThe league will follow a double round-robin format and showcase thirty-four matches. There will be thirty league stage games and three playoff matches, which will lead to the final match. The playoff games branch into three key matches: the Qualifier, Eliminator and Challenger.\n\nThe top two teams are selected for the Qualifier. The winner advances directly to the finals, whereas the loser waits at the Challenger stage. Next up is the Eliminator stage match between the 3rd and 4th teams. The winner receives an opportunity to play one more match and reach the finals, whereas the loser gets knocked out.\n\nThe Challenger match is between the loser of the Qualifier and the winner of the Eliminator. It’s the ultimate game to decide the second finalist for the tournament. All these matches will take place across three venues in three cities: Texas, Florida and California.\n\nMajor League Cricket 2025 Teams Squad: Captains, Complete Players List\n\nIn the debut season of Major League Cricket, MI New York won the championship after defeating the Seattle Orcas.

Wayne Parnell and Steve Smith led the Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom the previous year,\n\nSteve Smith is in Washington Freedom again this year, so he may be elected captain again.
