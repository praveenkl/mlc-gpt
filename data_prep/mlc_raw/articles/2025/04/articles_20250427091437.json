        "body": "Cognizant Major League Cricket (MLC) is pleased to announce the relocation of its headquarters to Grand Prairie, Texas, marking a major milestone in the league’s continued growth in the United States. As part of its investment in making Grand Prairie the home of cricket in the U.S., Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium will host the league’s Playoffs and Championship Final. The stadium will further serve as the venue for 12 regular-season games over 10 days, giving fans more options to watch live cricket this summer.\n\nGrand Prairie will host 12 regular-season games for the 2025 season from June 20-29, offering fans the opportunity to see all six MLC teams in action, including superstars Rashid Khan, Glenn Maxwell, and Faf Du Plessis. After ten days of thrilling regular season matchups, Season Three play will shift to Broward County Stadium in Florida on July 1, before returning to Grand Prairie for the highly anticipated MLC Playoffs on July 8, culminating in the Championship Final on July 13.\n\n“We’re delighted to continue making Grand Prairie the home of Cognizant Major League Cricket,” said Johnny Grave, CEO of Major League Cricket. “In addition to hosting 12 regular season games, we are excited to bring the Playoffs back to Grand Prairie and look forward to another sold-out Championship Final on July 13th. We will continue to enhance the stadium to host top-tier international events – starting with this weekend’s exciting match-up between the U.S. Women’s team and Zimbabwe’s Women’s team.”\n\nSeason Three of Cognizant Major League Cricket will kick off June 12 in Oakland, CA, at the newly transformed iconic Oakland Coliseum, where teams will compete in nine matches over seven days before travelling to Texas for the next leg of the season, before the regular season concludes at Broward County Stadium, FL in July. Teams then head back to Grand Prairie for the Playoffs, where the champion will be crowned in the Final on July 13th. With 34 matches from coast to coast and across three venues, this season marks the largest top-tier professional cricket tournament ever held in the U.S.\n\n“As we launch into another exciting season of Major League Cricket, I’m thrilled the league’s headquarters will now call North Texas home – a region that represents innovation, energy, and a deep love of sports,” said Anurag Jain, Co-owner of the Texas Super Kings. “This move reflects our commitment to growing the sport in the U.S. while bringing meaningful economic opportunities to North Texas. From job creation to increased tourism, we’re excited for the positive impact this will have on the region, and we look forward to making Grand Prairie at the heart of cricket’s growth in the U.S.”\n\nIn the 2024 season, Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium hosted four matches during the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup, including the U.S.’s dramatic Super Over victory defeating Pakistan, featuring star play by MLC players Saurabh Netravalkar, Monank Patel, and Aaron Jones. According to a recent Nielsen Sports study, the World Cup games generated a $100.4M economic impact in Texas, with 31% of international attendees visiting the state for the first time. Nationally, the T20 World Cup generated $618.4M in economic impact for the U.S.\n\n“We are thrilled Major League Cricket has decided to bring its full-time headquarters to our city,” said Ron Jensen, Grand Prairie Mayor. “The sport of Cricket helped put Grand Prairie on the map in front of the entire world. We owe that global exposure and economic success in large part to the hard work of everyone involved in the MLC. We look forward to another thrilling season and continuing to grow this wonderful sport for years to come.”\n\nBuilding on its momentum, Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium will host the Women’s U.S. and Zimbabwe cricket teams in an international match on Friday, April 25, at 10:45 a.m. as part of a five-game series.

The venue, located about 15 miles from downtown Dallas, is already home to one of the league’s six teams: the Texas Super Kings, which are co-owned by the Indian Premier League’s Chennai Super Kings, billionaire Ross Perot Jr. and Dallas businessman Anurag Jain.\n\n“It’s not ‘if,’ it’s ‘how long’ it will take to establish itself,” said Johnny Grave, the league’s chief executive officer, referring to the sport’s budding fan base in the US.\n\nThe season will run just one month, from June 12 to July 13. The goal is “owning a part of the calendar,” a window for teams to bring in top overseas players when larger leagues aren’t playing, Grave said. That part of the calendar also coincides with the hot Texas summer, when temperatures can easily climb above 100 F (38 C). But the league’s stadiums will all include permanent lights to allow for night games.\n\nKnown officially as Cognizant Major League Cricket, the league is entering its third season and has teams from San Francisco to Washington. Cricket will also feature in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, the first time since the Paris games in 1900.\n\n“The sport is growing like a little mushroom,” Jain said. “The story has just begun.”\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "date": "Sat Apr 26 06:30:01 2025",
        "body": "It’s 2025, and let’s be honest, cricket is no longer just about thrilling sixes or exciting finishes. It’s also where serious money is being made. From billionaires to young entrepreneurs, investors are lining up to be a part of the game, especially in T20 leagues like the IPL, Big Bash, SA20 and the US’s emerging Major League Cricket (MLC). So what’s the reason for this massive interest? Well, cricket, especially the fast-paced T20 version, has grown into a commercial force. Here’s why T20 cricket has become a hot topic in the financial world.\n\nT20: The Fast, Fun Format That’s Taking Over the World\n\nT20 has completely changed the way people watch and enjoy cricket. It’s short, exciting, and perfect for today’s fast, scrolling, streaming generation. This year, the IPL scored an all-time high with 800 million viewers worldwide, up 15% from 2024! It’s not just a cricket match; it’s Super Bowl-level attention-grabbing.\n\nIn the US, the MLC is growing in popularity. Cities like New York and Dallas are hosting packed games with over 50,000 fans, and it’s only in its third season. SA20 in South Africa also did well, generating sponsorship deals worth $30 million. T20 isn’t just a trend, it’s becoming a global business movement.\n\nAnd don’t forget social media. A single highlight of an IPL match can be viewed 10 million times in a day. This kind of online discussion is making cricket a gold mine for brands and investors.\n\nWhy Big Investors Are Betting on T20 Leagues\n\nLet’s talk about money. The IPL alone is now worth around $12 billion. How is it earning so much? Well, first, let’s talk about media rights. Between 2023 and 2027, these deals generated over $6 billion in revenue. Viacom18 paid $3 billion just for digital rights!\n\nThen let’s talk about sponsorships. Brands like Dream11, Paytm and Tata invested over $200 million for IPL 2025. Leagues like the BBL also saw brands like Toyota and KFC increase their ad spends by 12%. Brands consider cricket as their go-to destination.\n\nAnd it’s not just about ads. Owning a team is like buying a growing tech startup. Investors paid $120 million for the first MLC franchise in 2023. As of now, teams like the New York Liberty are already worth $35 million. Mukesh Ambani, Ryan Reynolds… big names have jumped in. Why? Because T20 franchises are growing rapidly.\n\nNew Ways to Invest in Cricket Without Owning a Team\n\nBuying a team sounds great, but what if you’re not a billionaire? Don’t worry, there are still ways to invest smartly.\n\nTake branding and sponsorship, for example. Tech companies like Cred and fintech players like PhonePe have signed multi-year deals to get their names out during matches. That kind of visibility among millions of viewers? Priceless.\n\nThen there’s digital. Streaming platforms are booming thanks to cricket. Disney+ Hotstar added five million subscribers during IPL 2025 alone. If you’re investing in stocks, think about these platforms—they’re directly tied to cricket’s growth. Even Dream11 is raking it in, with 200 million users and an $8 billion valuation this year.\n\nReal estate near stadiums is also heating up. Property prices around venues like Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium are up 10% this year. More matches mean more tourism, and that’s driving up demand.\n\nThe Risks You Should Know\n\nOf course, no investment is without its risks. With so many new leagues launching, like the ILT20 and LPL, the market is getting crowded. Some leagues are struggling to attract star players or fans. The ILT20, for example, had scheduling issues that caused a dip in viewership this year.\n\nThen there’s the economic side. Brands are tightening budgets due to inflation, and some are pulling back on ad spending. Smaller leagues are feeling the pinch, with the CPL even reporting a $2 million loss this year.\n\nAnd player burnout is real. Even top stars like Virat Kohli had to skip matches during IPL 2025 to manage their schedules. That affects the quality of the matches and fan excitement.\n\nFuture of Cricket Investments\n\nLooking ahead, the future still looks bright. AI is transforming how fans watch cricket. Platforms like Cricbuzz are using AI to show customized highlights, which has boosted user engagement by 25%. Tech companies working on this stuff could be a great long-term bet.\n\nWomen’s cricket is another big area to watch. The Women’s Premier League saw 300 million viewers this year, a 40% jump! Brands are investing more, and the momentum is building fast.\n\nIndia and Sri Lanka are co, hosting the 2025 T20 World Cup, which is set to bring in more fans, tourists, and yes, investors. Experts say franchise valuations could rise another 10–15% after the tournament. So if you’ve been waiting for the right time, now might be it.",
        "summary": "The article highlights the growing popularity and commercial success of T20 cricket leagues, including the MLC in the US. In its third season, the MLC has seen packed games in cities like New York and Dallas, with over 50,000 fans attending. The league's growth in popularity has attracted significant investment, with the first MLC franchise being sold for $120 million in 2023. Today, teams like the New York Liberty are already worth $35 million, indicating the rapid growth of these franchises.\n\nWhile the article does not provide specific details on the MLC's television viewership or revenue, it does mention that the league is part of a larger trend of T20 cricket's growing popularity and commercial success.

        "body": "In the quest to make cricket a mainstream sport in the United States, Major League Cricket (MLC) appears to be making headway. Launched in 2023 and granted T20 status soon after, MLC aims to overcome long-standing challenges in the U.S. cricket scene. These challenges have historically included a lack of pitches, kit, and coaching, which have held back the sport’s development in the US.\n\nThe history of cricket in the United States dates back to 1844 when the first international match took place between Canada and the USA. Despite this early start, the U.S. faced setbacks such as being excluded from the Imperial Cricket Conference founded in 1909. More recently, USA Cricket was formed in 2019 following the expulsion of the USA Cricket Association in 2017.\n\nCricket’s potential in the American market is underscored by a large expatriate population. The U.S. is home to nearly 10 million people from cricket-loving nations such as India, Pakistan, and the Caribbean. This expatriate market is expected to play a crucial role in popularizing the sport.\n\nThe ICC has identified the U.S. as a strategic priority, supporting MLC and planning to introduce cricket in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The recent inclusion of cricket in the upcoming Olympics is a significant milestone announced in October 2023.\n\nThe 2024 T20 World Cup, hosted by the U.S., turned out to be the most profitable ICC tournament to date, generating over $500 million. This event utilized venues such as Eisenhower Park in New York, Grand Prairie in Texas, and Lauderhill in Florida.\n\nMLC has gained momentum due to significant investments from individuals like Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Shantanu Narayen of Adobe. Furthermore, MLC has formed ties with established Indian franchises like the Mumbai Indians.\n\nDespite facing hurdles such as poor advertising, pitch issues, and stringent security, MLC has been deemed successful, with plans to expand by building new cricket venues and potentially hosting Olympic cricket.\n\nThe vision for cricket in the U.S. is to elevate its status to that of a mainstream sport, in a trajectory similar to soccer’s rise in popularity. With initiatives in place, and an engaged diaspora market, cricket may indeed have cracked the American market.",
