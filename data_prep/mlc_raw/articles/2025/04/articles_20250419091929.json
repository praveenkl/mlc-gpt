He has previously played exclusively for the Perth Scorchers in Australia’s Big Bash League, where he averages over 38 with the bat and maintains a bowling economy of 7.27.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This last year’s been a breakthrough for me on the international stage, and now I can’t wait to test myself in overseas franchise T20 for the first time with the San Francisco Unicorns,\" he said.\n\nConnolly, 21, brings experience from Australia’s national setup across all formats and is expected to strengthen the Unicorns' squad with both bat and ball. A left-handed batter and left-arm spinner, he has gained recognition for his ability to anchor innings and contribute with the ball in the middle overs.\n\n“The prospect of playing in front of a home crowd, as well as in Texas and Florida, alongside and against some of the biggest names in world cricket is very exciting, and I can’t wait to help the team put on a show for Unicorns and US cricket fans come June,” he added.\n\nShane Watson, Head Coach of San Francisco Unicorns, said: “Cooper’s all-round ability is going to be a key asset for the Unicorns this summer. Although he’s young, he’s shown maturity and adaptability beyond his age; not many players have international experience across both white ball formats and earned a baggy green at 21.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We came up one short last year, but now, playing in front of our home fans for the first time, with a largely settled roster and some key additions, like Cooper, we’re ready to go one better in our ambition to win the MLC trophy.”\n\nHe will join fellow young Australian Jake Fraser-McGurk in the Unicorns squad, who also made his international T20 debut with Connolly on their tour of England and Scotland after MLC 2024, along with fellow all-rounder and compatriot Matt Short for the 2025 season.",

The 38-year-old has a plethora of T20 experience behind him; his inclusion in the PSL came after he went unsold in the IPL 2025 mega auction.\n\nInterestingly, Warner’s record in T20 cricket has been sublime as of late.

The side topped the standings in 2023 with four wins and one loss in five matches.\n\nThey went on to play the final of the tournament, where they were unfortunately defeated by MI New York. However, the 2024 was a forgettable one for the side. Orcas failed to qualify for the knockout stages of the tournament in 2024 as they finished in last place in the standings with one win and six losses in seven matches.\n\nWith the new season approaching, Orcas will hope to put the past behind and start anew. Furthermore, the signing of David Warner could go on to bolster their squad even further. Notably, the MLC 2025 will be played between June 12 and July 13, and it will not clash with The Hundred like last year, where David Warner is due to play for London Spirit.",

The MLC 2025 season is scheduled to run from June 12 to July 13, marking a new and exciting chapter in Warner’s illustrious T20 career.\n\nDavid Warner heads to the USA for MLC 2025\n\nAt 37 years old, Warner is a seasoned campaigner in the world of T20 cricket, boasting an impressive resume built over years of competing in top global leagues. Across 401 T20 matches worldwide, he has accumulated a staggering 12,956 runs at a dynamic strike rate of 140.27. Known for his aggressive approach from the first ball and fearless strokeplay, Warner has consistently been one of the most destructive batters in the shortest format of the game. His inclusion is expected to provide a significant boost to Seattle Orcas’ top order, offering both explosive starts and invaluable experience.\n\nThis move represents Warner’s first foray into Major League Cricket, a league that has steadily gained traction since its inauguration in 2023. Seattle Orcas have experienced fluctuating fortunes in the initial two seasons. They finished atop the league standings in the inaugural 2023 season, showcasing strong potential, but experienced a downturn in 2024, finishing at the bottom of the table under the captaincy of Heinrich Klaasen. The signing of Warner is widely viewed as a strategic acquisition aimed at revitalizing the team’s performance and helping them reclaim a competitive edge in the upcoming season.\n\nAlso READ: PSL 2025 – David Warner shuts down a Pakistan reporter over Indians ‘spreading hate’ comment\n\nRetired Warner continues to impress in franchise cricket\n\nDespite his exceptional T20 credentials and a remarkable record in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as the fourth-highest run-scorer with 6,565 runs from 184 innings, Warner surprisingly went unsold at the IPL 2025 auction. This development raised eyebrows across the cricketing world. However, the Australian star has demonstrated that he remains in excellent form and high demand in other franchise leagues. He is currently captaining Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2025 after leading Sydney Thunder to Big Bash League (BBL) final with a strong performance, scoring 405 runs in 12 innings, and was part of the title-winning Dubai Capitals squad in the ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nWarner retired from international cricket in June 2024, concluding a storied career for Australia. However, his retirement from the international stage has not diminished his appeal in the global franchise circuit. He remains a sought-after player, participating in various leagues around the world.",
