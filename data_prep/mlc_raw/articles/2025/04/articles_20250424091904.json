        "date": "Wed Apr 23 00:00:00 2025",
        "body": "New Zealand Cricket will provide high-performance support and expertise as part of a ground-breaking partnership with a new franchise in Major League Cricket that is expected to be based in Toronto or Atlanta.\n\nAs I’ve reported previously, MLC, the fledgling T20 tournament in the U.S. that is about to start its third season, is set to expand from six teams to eight by 2027.\n\nTrue North Sports Ventures will launch one of the expansion franchises and is majority-owned by MLC co-founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, the league’s former chief executive. The investment arm of the San Francisco 49ers is among the private equity investors in TNS.\n\nIn a bold initiative, NZC will become the first national governing body to invest in an overseas T20 franchise league.\n\nNZC, a foundation investor in TNS, will provide operational support, including coaching, management and support staff, along with offering expertise in cricket infrastructure and turf management.\n\nIt is also an opportunity for NZC, a smaller cricket nation battling to retain its leading players to lucrative franchise leagues, to work closely with a growing T20 competition that already boasts a number of its top players, including stars Matt Henry, Rachin Ravindra, Finn Allen and Trent Boult.\n\n“As franchise cricket grows globally, NZC needs to adapt to seize strategic opportunities that ensure the sustainability of our cricket network,” NZC chief executive Scott Weenink said.\n\n“This helps diversify our revenue streams, expands our global brand and fan base, and creates new talent development and retention pathways for both our players and coaches.”\n\nIt is a new footprint for the well-heeled league aimed at developing cricket in the world’s biggest sports market.\n\nThree of the six current franchises in the MLC are owned by Indian Premier League team owners - Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings - while Seattle, the only small-market franchise in the league, have ties with Delhi Capitals.\n\nSan Francisco and Washington have partnerships with Australian states - Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales.\n\n“As founders of start-ups that have rapidly grown to established businesses, we see NZC as a perfect fit for our new franchise,\" said Srinivasan, who along with Mehta co-founded Willow TV, North America’s premier cricket broadcaster.\n\n“With NZC’s expertise, our expansion franchise will elevate MLC’s world-class T20 product and support cricket’s rapid growth in our region.\n\n“The potential for cricket in North America is immense, and we look forward to working with NZC to deliver on both our ambitions and theirs, including broader strategic and corporate opportunities globally.\"\n\nAfter numerous markets were explored, the new franchise will be based in Atlanta or Toronto, cities with significant South Asian communities. If Toronto is chosen then MLC will move into Canada which already boasts a T20 league.\n\nMLC co-founder Satyan Gajwani will launch the other new franchise with Philadelphia and Chicago on the shortlist. Final decisions on the two new franchises are expected later in the year.\n\nMLC is expected to eventually expand to 10 teams - mimicking the IPL - by early next decade. “I think this league is capable of supporting 10 teams in the medium term,” San Francisco Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman told me.\n\n“I think 10 is probably the right number for the North American market, which significantly also includes Canada. But we’ve got a big geography and we’ll have to think through the complications of that.”\n\nAn expanded MLC might mean more games and a longer duration of the competition, which could lead to wider implications for a sport struggling to breathe due to an increasingly congested calendar.\n\nFor this upcoming season, the monthlong MLC will start earlier than its previous two editions as it attempts to nestle into a June-mid July slot that does not clash with rival leagues in the U.K and Caribbean.\n\n“We’re trying to own the calendar for a month in T20 cricket in this part of the world and position it very much as a league for the U.S. market,” new MLC chief executive Johnny Grave told me recently.",
        "summary": "**Expansion and Partnerships**: MLC is expanding from 6 teams to 8 by 2027, with two new franchises launching. One franchise will be based in either Toronto or Atlanta, owned by True North Sports Ventures, which has New Zealand Cricket (NZC) as a foundation investor. NZC will provide operational support, coaching, and management expertise to the franchise.\n\n**Significance**: This partnership marks the first time a national governing body has invested in an overseas T20 franchise league. It will help NZC diversify its revenue streams, expand its global brand, and create new talent development pathways.\n\n**MLC Growth**: The league is expected to eventually expand to 10 teams, mimicking the Indian Premier League (IPL). The expanded league might lead to more games and a longer duration, potentially causing implications for the sport's congested calendar.\n\n**Upcoming Season**: The month-long MLC will start earlier this season, from June to mid-July, attempting to establish itself as a premier T20 league in the US market."

        "body": "NZC MLC Partnership: New Zealand Cricket Joins Forces to Launch MLC Expansion Franchise by 2027\n\nSummary\n\nNew Zealand Cricket (NZC) has signed a groundbreaking deal with True North Sports Ventures (TNS) to co-launch a new franchise in Major League Cricket (MLC), starting in the 2027 season. This marks the first time an ICC full member has partnered directly with a T20 franchise in a major professional league. The NZC MLC partnership brings high-performance expertise and investment power to the table, supporting cricket's growth in North America. Markets like Toronto and Atlanta are under review for the franchise base, with strategic long-term expansion into 2031 already in planning. The move positions NZC as a global player in the commercialization of cricket.\n\nSummary: New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has partnered with True North Sports Ventures to co-own a Major League Cricket expansion franchise debuting in 2027. The NZC MLC partnership signifies a new chapter for cricket in North America and global T20 growth.\n\nA Bold Move: NZC’s Strategic Entry into North American Cricket\n\nThe NZC MLC partnership is more than just another expansion story it’s a strategic leap into the future of cricket. By teaming up with True North Sports Ventures, the operational arm tied to MLC co-founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, NZC is breaking new ground as the first full ICC member to enter into a direct franchise ownership role in a high-profile T20 league outside its home territory. This move aligns with the broader trend of globalization in cricket and signals New Zealand’s intent to remain competitive both on and off the field.\n\nMajor League Cricket Expansion 2027 – A New Era\n\nSet to debut in 2027, the new franchise will be part of MLC’s first wave of league expansion, which aims to grow from six to eight teams. By 2031, the league plans to feature ten franchises, reinforcing its ambition to become the premier summer T20 competition worldwide. North American cities like Toronto and Atlanta are being evaluated for their potential to host the team, tapping into regions with strong immigrant communities and an existing appetite for cricket.\n\nThe partnership also opens doors for NZC to co-develop a second franchise by 2031, giving them a strategic footprint in both early and long-term phases of Major League Cricket expansion.\n\nWhy the NZC MLC Partnership Makes Sense Now\n\nAccording to NZC CEO Scott Weenink, this collaboration is timely. As he put it, cricket is undergoing a \"global transformation,\" and organizations must adapt or risk falling behind. The New Zealand Cricket North America venture is designed not just to expand revenue but to deepen player development pathways, broaden the fanbase, and amplify NZC’s global footprint. Weenink sees the MLC opportunity as an essential diversification of cricket’s ecosystem one that introduces New Zealand’s values, coaching expertise, and development systems to the booming American sports market.\n\nTrue North Sports Ventures, backed by private equity and major sports investors including the San Francisco 49ers’ investment arm (49ers Enterprises), is equally bullish. The firm brings operational firepower and access to elite sports networks, and its MLC ties ensure a seamless entry for NZC’s talent and structure.\n\nWhat This Means for New Zealand Cricket\n\nThe impact of the NZC MLC partnership will likely go far beyond North American borders. By investing early in MLC’s future, NZC not only gains equity but a say in the growth of a league poised to be the IPL of the West. It’s also a signal to other boards that participation in global franchise cricket doesn’t have to be passive. With performance staff, infrastructure consultation, and scouting pipelines to be provided by NZC, the benefits run both ways.\n\nThis move could also have implications for player retention. Young Kiwi cricketers, often lured by overseas leagues, may now find clearer pathways through NZC-run entities abroad. It could also make New Zealand a more attractive hub for overseas players looking to connect to the North American market.\n\nWillow TV, Fan Growth, and Cricket’s American Moment\n\nCrucial to the expansion’s success is the pre-existing popularity of MLC broadcasts via Willow TV, the premier cricket streaming service in North America. Founded by Mehta and Srinivasan, Willow already delivers content to millions and will play a central role in building the franchise’s fanbase. The Major League Cricket expansion 2027 isn’t starting from scratch it’s entering a market already showing signs of explosive interest.\n\nThis momentum has been further boosted by the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024 and cricket’s inclusion in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, both of which have laid the groundwork for long-term engagement with North American audiences. The new franchise will immediately have access to over 25 million cricket fans in the region.\n\nThe Road Ahead: Infrastructure, Expertise, and Legacy Building\n\nIn its second phase, the NZC MLC partnership will expand into infrastructure development. Turf management, coaching systems, academy tie-ups, and even stadium collaborations could emerge as part of NZC’s larger role in shaping the league’s standards. As part of this blueprint, New Zealand’s tried-and-tested cricketing culture and lean, efficient development models will serve as a framework for success.\n\nIt’s also a story of alignment entrepreneurial vision meets sporting tradition. Both NZC and TNS are bringing their unique strengths to the table. TNS has shown it can scale start-ups like Willow and MLC. NZC, on the other hand, brings legacy, governance, and proven international success.\n\nConclusion: A Partnership for the Modern Cricketing Age\n\nThe NZC MLC partnership is a landmark moment not just for New Zealand but for cricket as a whole. It represents a fusion of traditional cricket excellence with North America’s innovation-driven sports economy. As the global cricket map redraws itself, NZC’s proactive move could set a precedent for other boards to follow. Whether it’s talent development, fan engagement, or strategic investment, this initiative places NZC at the heart of cricket’s next frontier.\n\nMore details about the team name, branding, and home city will be announced later in 2025. Until then, one thing is certain cricket in North America just got a serious boost."

        "body": "News Summary\n\nGrand Prairie, Texas, welcomes Major League Cricket as it relocates its headquarters from San Francisco. This move signals cricket’s growing popularity in the U.S., with plans for expansion and a commitment to nurturing the sport. MLC’s third season kicks off in June 2024, and the league’s ambitious agenda includes significant investments to promote cricket throughout the nation. With influential backers and an eye on the upcoming Olympics, the future looks bright for cricket in Grand Prairie and across Texas.\n\nGrand Prairie Takes Center Stage as Major League Cricket Moves Headquarters to Texas\n\nExciting news is unfolding in the vibrant city of Grand Prairie, Texas! Major League Cricket (MLC), which made quite a splash when it launched its inaugural season in 2023, is relocating its headquarters from the iconic San Francisco to this friendly Texan hub. This move is not just about changing addresses; it’s a thrilling sign of cricket’s rising popularity in the United States!\n\nA New Era for Cricket in Texas\n\nMark your calendars for April 24, 2024, when MLC will make the official announcement during a press conference that promises to be packed with optimism. Leading the charge will be Johnny Grave, the fresh-faced CEO of MLC, who is all set to take the league to new heights. Also taking the stage will be Anurag Jain, a managing partner at Perot Jain and a key backer of the league.\n\nAs MLC gears up for its highly anticipated third season, kick-off is just around the corner in June 2024. The majority of the action has been enjoyed at the Grand Prairie Stadium, which has undergone a significant transformation from a minor league baseball park into a cricket ground that champions this globally loved sport. This redevelopment has been a game-changer for cricket enthusiasts in the area.\n\nCricket Fever on the Rise\n\nDid you know that cricket is the world’s second most popular sport, trailing only behind soccer? The buzz around cricket is contrary to what many may think—it’s not just a pastime; it’s a burgeoning movement here in the U.S.! With around 200,000 players involved across more than 400 local leagues and programs, the cricket landscape is expanding, making it an electrifying time for the sport.\n\nRecently, the U.S. cricket team made headlines during the T20 World Cup by pulling off a sensational upset against Pakistan, providing a significant boost to local economies. Grand Prairie, in particular, reaped the rewards, as the T20 World Cup generated an estimated $1.9 million in local economic impact. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of cricket’s potential influence in the area!\n\nLooking Towards the Future\n\nAs the sport continues to gain traction, cricket will be returning to the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028, marking its first appearance since 1900. This revival is expected to elevate the profile of cricket even further in the States, ushering in new fans and players alike.\n\nCurrently, MLC features six competitive teams, including the much-loved Texas Super Kings.

The move marks NZC’s bold entry into the North American cricket market, with ambitions of diversifying revenue and strengthening its global footprint.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, TNS will oversee operations of the franchise, one of two expansion teams granted to MLC co-founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan. The second team may launch in 2031, with NZC retaining rights to collaborate on future cricket ventures in the US and beyond.\n\nToronto and Atlanta in contention as franchise location\n\nTNS is currently exploring multiple markets for the team’s home base, including Toronto and Atlanta. The franchise is expected to tap into growing North American cricket interest following the 2024 T20 World Cup and ahead of cricket’s return to the Olympics in Los Angeles 2028.\n\nNZC’s strategic pivot to overseas franchise investment\n\nScott Weenink, CEO of NZC, emphasized that this deal is a milestone in the organization’s shift from traditional revenue models to international investments. “This agreement marks a unique and exciting milestone for NZC,” Weenink said. “Franchise cricket is growing, and we need to evolve to remain financially sustainable.”\n\nNZC currently lacks a fully commercial domestic T20 league. The Super Smash, owned by NZC, serves primarily as a development tournament. With pressure mounting on broadcast revenues and ICC distributions, Weenink indicated that NZC is exploring multiple models, including potential privatization of Super Smash and investment in international franchises.\n\nMinority stake, major operational involvement\n\nWhile NZC will be a minority shareholder in the TNS-led franchise, its operational role will be significant. The board will provide high-performance services, coaching, and support staff, with annual revenues from this expected to reach seven figures.\n\n“We anticipate both capital growth and dividend income from this partnership,” said Weenink, highlighting the dual financial and strategic benefits.\n\nPositioning NZC in the US and Indian markets\n\nThis partnership is not just about financial return—it’s about global brand expansion. Weenink noted a deliberate push to grow NZC’s presence in India and the US. “India remains untapped in many ways for us, and we see the US as a massive growth opportunity,” he said.\n\nHe added that NZC aims to leverage the growing popularity of MLC, along with key sporting events like the Olympics in LA, to build deeper connections with fans and stakeholders in both markets.\n\nMLC founders: “NZC is the perfect fit”\n\nSpeaking on behalf of TNS, MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta praised NZC’s values and resilience. “TNS is delighted to partner with NZC, an organisation admired for its sustained success despite limited resources,” he said.\n\nMehta added, “With NZC’s cricketing expertise, our new franchise will strengthen MLC’s global standing and help unlock the sport’s full potential in North America.”\n\nThe move positions NZC at the heart of cricket’s evolving global landscape, signaling a new era for international board-level partnerships.",
