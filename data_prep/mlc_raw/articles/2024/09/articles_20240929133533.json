        "body": "With the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket just a week away, we go through all 19 members of the playing squad, starting with all the A’s: Adam Milne, Akeal Hosein, Akhilesh Bodugum and Andries Gous.\n\nAdam Milne\n\nA combination of speed, intelligence and a high-level of skill makes Adam Milne one of the most feared fast bowlers in the world.\n\nAlthough injuries have hampered his early career, the 31-year-old New Zealander joins Freedom at the peak of his powers, with an impressive record at both international and global franchise levels.\n\nAlthough Milne is not especially tall for a fast bowler (6ft 1in), he bowls regularly in excess of 93mph (150kmh) and extracts sharp bounce which makes him hard to score off, as well as being a regular wicket-taker.\n\nHe was the outstanding paceman in the 2021 edition of The Hundred, where he represented Birmingham Phoenix, and has played for Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL.\n\nFollow Adam Milne on Instagram\n\nAkeal Hosein\n\nAkeal is as exciting a cricketer as they come. A mainstay of the West Indies national team, his left-arm spin has taken him to the top, with his fielding and power hitting keeping him there. Combining intelligence with the ball, and power with the bat, Hosein forced his way into the national set-up in early 2021 and hasn’t looked back since.\n\nHe won the Caribbean Premier League with Trinbago Knight Riders, signed for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash in 2022 and represented Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL in 2023.\n\nA spinner by craft, one of Hosein’s greatest bowling weapons is his quicker ball that doesn’t curves viciously in the air. You’re likely to see Hosein bowl early in an innings and trick many a batter with the ball that they expect to turn one way, before it curves even faster the other. A rising star of the sport, we can’t wait to see Akeal in red, white and blue.\n\nFollow Akeal on Instagram\n\nAkhilesh Bodugum\n\nA sneaky spinner, Bodugum signed as our rookie player this year. He has a quick arm and good variation which he uses to upset the batter’s rhythm. His excellent control of pace means Bodugum can bowl in or outside of the power play.\n\nBodugum already has 39 wickets and a championship title to his name with Seattle Thunderbolts in Minor League Cricket. A clearly talented individual, Akhilesh also prides himself on his fruit smoothies.\n\nAt only 23-years-old, Bodugum adds youthful flair to our international experienced Washington Freedom squad.\n\nFollow Akhilesh on Instagram\n\nAndries Gous\n\nOur No.1 draft pick with over 5000 runs and a T20 Hundred to his name, Gous has a healthy history of success. He was top run scorer for the Seattle Thunderbolts in the 2022 Minor League season, helping to lead the team to championship victory.\n\nThe Golden Gous is known for his crisp striking and calculated aggression. The free-scoring wicketkeeper-batter hits 50’s for fun and knows how to control an innings. His high-class glovework behind the stumps makes Gous an excellent all-round option.\n\nSouth African born, Gous was included in the Jo’burg Giants’ squad for the first season of the T20 Global League. He now plys his trade in America full time.",
