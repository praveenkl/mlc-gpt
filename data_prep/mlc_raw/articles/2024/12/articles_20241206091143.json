        "date": "",
        "body": "Jones caught the cricketing world's attention during the recent ICC World Cup, where his explosive 94 off 40 balls led the USA to a dominant seven-wicket victory over Canada in the opening match.\n\nChasing a target of 195, his innings helped the USA secure the win with 14 balls to spare. He finished the tournament as one of the team’s standout performers, scoring 162 runs in six innings at an average of 40.5.\n\nHis performances have earned him opportunities in Major League Cricket (MLC) on home soil and the Caribbean Premier League (CPL). In the CPL final, Jones’ 48 off 31 deliveries played a crucial role in securing the title for Saint Lucia Kings.\n\nThis will not be Jones’ first stint in the BPL. He featured in the previous season for Rangpur Riders but only played one match, where he did not bat or bowl but managed to take a catch."
