        "date": "Thu Jul 13 07:59:16 2023",
        "body": "Major League Cricket got another boost as the Texas Super Kings announced their signing of the veteran legspinner Imran Tahir. Tahir has previously featured for TSK's sister franchise in the IPL, and was also part of Chennai Super Kings' title winning runs in 2018 and 2021.\n\nIn 59 IPL matches, Tahir has picked 82 wickets at an economy rate of 7.76 runs an over. The leg-spinner also has 173 ODI and 63 T20I wickets to his name in an international career that spanned from 2011 to 2019.\n\nPresumably, Tahir has been signed as a replacement for Ambati Rayudu, who was originally included in the Texas Super Kings squad. After BCCI's proposal of a one-year cooling period for retired players, the recently retired Rayudu withdrew, citing personal reasons. He was also a part of the CSK squad that lifted the trophy in 2023.\n\nThe signing also makes Tahir the eighth overseas player in TSK's squad. He joins David Miller, Dwayne Bravo, Devon Conway, Daniel Sams, Faf du Plessis, Mitchell Santner and Gerald Coetzee. Barring Miller and Sams, everyone else has previously players for a Super Kings franchise in IPL or SA20.\n\nTexas Super Kings begin their campaign against the Los Angeles Knight Riders on opening night at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas."

        "title": "The Development of Cricket in the United States",
        "date": "Sun Dec  1 09:30:14 2024",
        "body": "It’s been an essential year for cricket in the United States. While the sport still has a small following here, its fanbase is proliferating, and that growth should increase steadily in 2024 and beyond.\n\nIn 2023, we saw the first season of Major League Cricket, a tournament that attracted some of the best players. In the following 12 months, cricket fans in the US can enjoy even more of those top stars as the country becomes a joint host of the T20 World Cup.\n\nEarly Days\n\nIt’s widely known among serious cricket enthusiasts that the United States took part in the first-ever international match. The game was played in 1844 at St George’s Park in New York, and it saw a US team take on their neighbor Canada.\n\nThis game occurred 33 years before Australia and England’s first official test match, but cricket failed to take off in America. Sports such as baseball, basketball, and American football would begin to dominate, and that situation remains today.\n\nCricket became a fringe sport, mainly played by ex-pats from various countries, and resident Americans needed to show more interest in the sport.\n\nNeutral Hosts\n\nCricket’s profile in the United States started to rise when the West Indies began to play some of their “home” games in Florida. The Central Broward Park Ground at Lauderhill was used for its first international match when New Zealand hosted Sri Lanka in a T20 global in May 2010.\n\nWith their proximity to the Eastern coast, the West Indies became regular visitors to Central Broward Park. Their most recent fixture here came in August this year when the Windies took on India in another T20i.\n\nLauderhill has proved popular as a semi-regular option for fixtures requiring a neutral location, and some players will be familiar with the surface when they arrive for the World Cup in 2023.\n\nThe presence of those international teams also helped raise interest in cricket across the United States. Lauderhill stands alone as an international ground, but that will change after the 2024 World Cup. Two additional venues will be in place for the big event.\n\nInternational Milestones\n\nThe advent of T20 cricket from 2003 onwards opened the sport up to minor playing nations worldwide. Teams found they could be more competitive in a shorter format, and there have been some significant T20 international upsets.\n\nThe 20-over game is also more fun, and that element led to increased interest. It’s now a global game, and the USA is among the nations that have experienced a resurgence in the sport.\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) opened up its list of associate members who could play international cricket in the limited overs formats. Subsequently, the United States Men’s National Cricket Team played its first T20 international against the United Arab Emirates in 2019.\n\nThe ICC also implemented a world league where teams of similar standings play each other. These developing nations must enjoy competitive cricket, as that will fuel belief and a desire to improve. That was the aim of the ICC, and the USMNCT is one of the teams to benefit.\n\nMajor League Cricket\n\nAfter much work in the development stages, 2023 saw the first edition of Major League Cricket in the US. The inaugural competition was based on the T20 format, and it saw six teams take part across 18 days in July.\n\nWhile the best domestic players were involved, the success of these tournaments depended on their ability to attract big stars from across the cricket world. In that respect, the tournament hit its targets, with international players from the West Indies, England, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa participating.\n\nThe top names to compete in 2023 were Sunil Narine, Faf Du Plessis, Jason Roy, Aaron Finch, Kieron Pollard, and Nicholas Pooran. Each player boasts vast international experience, providing extra interest for cricket fans worldwide.\n\nMajor League Cricket was broadcast live across the globe, and viewing figures were steady, if not spectacular. Attendances inside the stadiums were a little disappointing, with an average of 3,684 fans watching each of the 19 games.\n\nIt was a slow start, but MLC has a platform to build through 2024.\n\nThe Biggest Honor\n\nIn 2024, The United States will share hosting duties with the West Indies for the latest edition of the T20 World Cup. Global limited-overs competition began in 1975, but this is the first time any tournament will feature games in the USA.\n\nAs joint hosts, the United States men’s cricket team has pre-qualified for the event, featuring 20 teams from around the cricketing world. The tournament will begin on June 4, with the final on June 30.\n\nThrough 2023, venues have been confirmed for the event, and the stadiums involved will be spread across the country. Three US grounds are preparing for hosting duties, and these are:\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Dallas.\n\nCentral Broward Park in Lauderhill, Florida.\n\nEisenhower Park Stadium in East Meadow, Long Island\n\nDates and fixtures are yet to be determined, but those facilities will play an active part in the 2024 tournament. It’s a big deal for cricket in the United States and one that the governing body should be using as a springboard for a positive future.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold?\n\nThe United States cricket team’s ultimate aim is to compete with the established nations. Their performance at the 2024 World Cup will allow the side to see how much work needs to be done.\n\nThe advent of Major League Cricket was a bonus for the game in the US, but the tournament’s first edition wasn’t well attended. Organizers must look at the crowd and viewing figures and assess how these can be improved.\n\nIn short, while there is growing interest in cricket across the United States, the sport is at a crossroads. One concern is the suggestion that hosting would be moved away from the US due to the financial position of the governing body, USA Cricket.\n\nThose stories have been dismissed, and the United States is on course to fulfill those hosting duties. Those stunning grounds in top tourist locations will attract many overseas visitors, but will a global tournament inspire the local population to take up the game?\n\nCricket will never be able to compete with the big four sports in the United States. Football, basketball, hockey, and basketball will always take precedence, and no other events can challenge their popularity.\n\nThere is a chance that Major League Cricket could rival Major League Soccer in the future and that fans will slowly build a fanbase for the Seattle Orcas, the Texas Super Kings, and other MLC sides.\n\nHopefully, for the sake of the sport in the US and for cricket fans worldwide, the 2024 World Cup will inspire future followers and players."
