        "body": "SBJ Live\n\nFriday at 12:30ET, we unveil SBJ's 10 Most Innovative Sports Tech Companies\n\nFacilities\n\nWashington Freedom cricket owner lobbies for stadium at RFK site\n\nMajor League Cricket team Washington Freedom owner Sanjay Govil has “lobbied top city officials for months” to construct a cricket stadium on the RFK Stadium campus, according to Wiener & Brice-Saddler of the WASHINGTON POST. Washington Freedom -- one of Major League Cricket’s six founding teams -- plays its matches in Morrisville, N.C. and Dallas. Team officials say that the approximately 4,000-seat facility “would be temporary while development plans for the site are worked out,” but they “hope eventually to build a permanent one if Congress approves legislation to hand over the land to D.C.” Govil has hired lobbying firm Group 360 LLC with ties to the D.C. government entity that oversees the RFK site. Group 360 is run by Max Brown, who “for eight years chaired the board of Events DC.” Govil confirmed that he has engaged Brown to “make the case for a stadium that could house not just cricket but also rugby and other events.” Avikar Govil, son of Sanjay Govil, noted that he and his father are “pitching a venue with about 4,000 temporary seats, probably in the form of bleachers.” He expects that it will be “five to seven years before permanent plans for the site take shape, at which point he hopes for a larger, long-term stadium” (WASHINGTON POST, 11/30)."

        "body": "The Hobart Hurricanes have signed Afghan left-arm wrist spinner Waqar Salamkheil after Rishad Hossain became unavailable for the duration of BBL|14 due to the Bangladesh Premier League.\n\nSalamkheil has most recently played in the Caribbean Premier League in October for the Trinbago Knight Riders taking 15 wickets in 11 matches.\n\nThe 23-year-old has played plenty of franchise T20 cricket globally, including in the CPL, Pakistan Super League, USA’s Major League Cricket, South Africa’s SA-20 and more.\n\nSalamkheil will leave the Hurricanes after six games before joining the MI Emirates in the ILT20, starting in January.\n\nMaking his debut for Afghanistan as a 17-year-old in a Test against Ireland, Salamkheil took two wickets in each innings, to help the Afghans to their first-ever test victory in 2019.\n\nHe will be joining teammate Tim David in Hobart this summer, who played with Salamkheil at the Knight Riders in the CPL and also for the MI Emirates in the ILT20.\n\nThe Afghan will join the hurricanes’ spin ranks alongside Paddy Dooley and Peter Hatzoglou. His different variations will play a role for the Hurricanes against opposition who are unlikely to have faced him before.\n\nCanes High Performance General Manager Salliann Beams said: “Waqar is a tremendous young talent, he adds a different element to our bowling line-up and is a wrist spinner with a well-disguised wrong-un, similar to Rishad (Hossain).\n\n“While we are disappointed that Rishad can’t join us because of the BPL, we know that we have someone who will help us win matches in the first half of the tournament in Waqar.\n\n“He was on our radar during the draft, with Ricky (Ponting) and (James) Hopsey familiar with his talent after seeing him play in franchise cricket, he will complement what we have in our squad already.”\n\nThe Hobart Hurricanes start their BBL|14 campaign in just over three weeks, playing against the Melbourne Renegades at Geelong in their first game.\n\nView all the predicted line-ups here"
