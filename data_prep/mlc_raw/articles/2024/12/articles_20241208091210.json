        "body": "A group of around 50 leading English cricketers are considering boycotting next year’s Hundred in protest against the crackdown on playing in overseas franchise tournaments.\n\nThe ECB recently announced changes to its No Objection Certificate (NoC) policy, which would prohibit players from participating in overseas tournaments that coincide with the English summer.\n\nThe policy applies to leagues such as the Pakistan Super League (PSL), Major League Cricket (MLC), Global T20 Canada, Lanka Premier League (LPL), and Caribbean Premier League (CPL). Notably, the Indian Premier League (IPL) remains exempt from these restrictions.\n\nThis decision has sparked widespread frustration among players and their agents.\n\nMany feel the policy unfairly limits their earning potential and opportunities to compete globally.\n\nIn response, players have engaged in a series of meetings with the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) to discuss collective action.\n\nOn Monday, two key meetings were held, attended by 50 players. Following these discussions, the PCA decided to seek legal counsel from a King’s Counsel (KC) to explore their options. The players also initiated talks about adopting a unified stance regarding their participation in The Hundred.\n\nThe ECB’s policy decision has not only led to player discontent but also raised questions about fairness, particularly in granting exemptions to the IPL.\n\nIf unresolved, the proposed boycott could significantly impact next year’s The Hundred tournament, highlighting growing tensions between players and cricketing authorities over restrictive policies.\n\nThe belief is this that could create significant headaches for the ECB at a time when they are selling stakes in the eight Hundred teams to investors and need their best English players to keep the standard high.\n\nIt is a risk, though. The ECB is set to announce a rise in the top bracket of pay for the men’s Hundred next year – it is expected to be around £175,000 for the month-long tournament – which could turn players’ heads. As one source said:\n\n“In principle, this is a really strong stance that shows the strength of feeling. The question is if some break ranks, because money talks, and there could be a domino effect.”\n\nThe possibility of proper industrial action through the PCA is effectively a non-starter, given the need for a majority vote among their members.\n\nIn addition, it is understood that a handful of big-name county players are considering retiring from red-ball action and renegotiating their county contracts if their lucrative contracts in Pakistan are confirmed."
