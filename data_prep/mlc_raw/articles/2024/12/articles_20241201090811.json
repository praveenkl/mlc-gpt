        "date": "Sat Nov 30 00:00:00 2024",
        "body": "There are an estimated 10 million to 20 million cricket fans in America, and thousands of them may be able to watch the sport live in D.C. if a major lobbying push by the owner of the city’s Major League Cricket team is successful.\n\nThe Washington Freedom, one of the league’s six founding teams, won this year’s Major League Cricket World Series in July. But despite having “Washington” in its name, it doesn’t have a home field in the city, or even the region. Instead, the team plays its matches inMorrisville, N.C., and Dallas.\n\nIts owner is trying to change that and has lobbied top city officials for months to construct a cricket stadium on the RFK Stadium campus, which the city is working to take over from the federal government and redevelop, possibly into a new home for the Washington Commanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe approximately 4,000-seat facility would be temporary while development plans for the site are worked out, team officials say, but they hope eventually to build a permanent one if Congress approves legislation to hand over the land to D.C.\n\nIn efforts to reach that goal, Sanjay Govil, who owns Washington Freedom, has hired a lobbying firm with ties to the D.C. government entity that oversees the RFK site.\n\nDistrict lobbying disclosure forms show that AcersInfra LLC — which shares the Rockville business address used by Govil’s international digital engineering and IT firm — has been paying $19,000 a month to the lobbying firm Group 360 LLC to “secure site for cricket/multipurpose facility” in the city.\n\nGroup 360 is run by Max Brown, who for eight years chaired the board of Events DC, the District’s sports and entertainment authority, which controls the stadium site under a lease from the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lobbying forms filed with the city show that Group 360 has held meetings with a half-dozen top D.C. officials since July, including current Events DC chair Angie Gates and Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Nina Albert.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nMake the most of the DMV with our newsletter\n\nMake living in D.C. a little easier and more fun. Sign up for the Post Local newsletter to get local news, weather and expert advice — where to eat, where to drink and how to get around — every weekday.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nGovil confirmed in a phone interview that he has engaged Brown to make the case for a stadium that could house not just cricket but also rugby and other events.\n\nGovil noted that cricket is widely considered the world’s second-most-popular sport, behind soccer, driven in large part by its hundreds of millions of fans in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora.\n\n“It’s definitely a sport which is really growing in popularity in the United States,” he said. He cited the proliferation of cricket leagues in the region — in Prince George’s, Howard and Loudoun counties, among others — as evidence of the sport’s local popularity, which could bolster ticket sales at a D.C. stadium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCricket enjoyed a heyday in the United States in the 19th century. The first international sporting event in history was a U.S.-Canada cricket match in 1844, according to Major League Cricket. But baseball soon became America’s pastime, and Americans eventually came to regard cricket as an obscure curiosity, with complicated rules involving wickets and matches that often lasted days.\n\nNow that’s beginning to change. A new format called T20, introduced in 2003, has shortened the game to three or four hours and become an international sensation. In the United States, which has more than 5 million residents of South Asian descent, Major League Cricket launched last year using this format. This year’s U.S. national team is the most successful in history, scoring an upset of Pakistan in June. Two men’s Cricket World Cup matches held in Nassau County, N.Y., each drew more than 34,000 spectators to a temporary stadium.\n\nThe Freedom initially sought to build a temporary baseball/cricket stadium at George Mason University’s Fairfax County campus, an effort that drew intense opposition from surrounding residents who worried about the traffic it would bring to the area. In March, George Mason announced that wouldn’t be happening. Govil said he backed out of those discussions in hopes of identifying a “cricket-first” stadium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGovil and his son, Avikar, then set their sights on RFK. The legislation pending in the Senate to transfer RFK to the city would require 30 percent of the site to be green space, and the cricket field would qualify, they argued.\n\n“Mayor Bowser has proposed D.C. being a sports capital, and being the Washington Freedom, we think we should play in Washington, D.C.,” Avikar Govil said.\n\nFor years, on social media and in prepared remarks, Bowser has repeatedly declared that D.C. is the “#SportsCapital” — contending that the region’s major sports teams should play in the District.\n\nAthletics have been central to Bowser’s third-term agenda as she seeks to mitigate slowing revenue growth in the aftermath of the pandemic. This week, for example, the D.C. Council advanced a first vote on a $515 million spending package to renovate Capital One Arena.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is perhaps no surprise, then, that some of Bowser’s recent budget proposals have successfully carved out money for sports — including a 2023 investment to expand the city’s pickleball courts and a $60 million proposal a year earlier to fund a “multi-level, state-of-the-art indoor sport complex” on the RFK Stadium grounds, which remains in the planning phase.\n\nThe city also attempted unsuccessfully to host the 2026 World Cup soccer tournament, and it’s put in a pending bid to host the NFL draft on the National Mall after being a finalist for the 2024 draft.\n\nAlbert’s office, which oversees city development projects, declined an interview about the potential for a cricket stadium at RFK.\n\nBut in a statement, the office said, “As we work to realize RFK’s ultimate future, we remain committed to partnering with Events DC to activate the RFK Campus and make it more accessible for community use.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Events DC spokesperson said the organization is open to exploring opportunities at the RFK campus, including temporary ones that could result in jobs and other economic impacts.\n\n“Our goal is to promote the District as a world-class destination for sports, meetings, conventions, entertainment and more and we are in regular communication with event organizers, sports officials, concert promoters and others to fulfill this mission,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nAvikar Govil said he and his father are pitching a venue with about 4,000 temporary seats, probably in the form of bleachers. He expects it’ll be five to seven years before permanent plans for the site take shape, at which point he hopes for a larger, long-term stadium.\n\nConversations with the city have been “quite positive so far,” he said. He said he and his father commissioned an economic analysis by the real estate consulting firm RCLCO, which forecast that the venue would generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the city through ticket sales and hotel visits.\n\n“Cricket’s a very international sport, rugby’s a very international sport,” Avikar Govil said. “So we activate all these people to come into D.C.”"
