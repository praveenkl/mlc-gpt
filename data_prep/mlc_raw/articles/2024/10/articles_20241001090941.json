The acquisition will be finalized over 24 months and aims to enhance Hampshire's infrastructure and talent development. GMR's global sports investments include IPL Delhi Capitals, ILT20 Dubai Capitals, and Major League Cricket Seattle Orcas.\n\nNEW DELHI: A significant turning point in cricket history has been reached with the announcement today by GMR Group, a prominent international infrastructure corporation, of the acquisition of Hampshire Cricket . This sets a new standard for the sport of cricket as it is the first time an international firm has purchased a county team.\n\nA formal agreement has been reached by GMR Global Pte Ltd (GGPL), a GMR Group company, to purchase all of Hampshire Sport & Leisure Holdings Limited ( HSLHL ), the parent company of Hampshire Cricket. Over the course of the next 24 months, the acquisition will be finished in stages. One of the 18 First-Class counties in England and Wales is Hampshire Cricket, which was established in 1863.\n\nIt is anticipated that Hampshire Cricket and GMR's cooperation would propel substantial growth and development in the county. Hampshire's infrastructure will be improved, its reach will be increased, and talent development will be encouraged thanks to GMR's worldwide experience and resources.\n\nThe parties formally agreed upon the main terms and conditions of this agreement a year ago. The enterprise value includes a fair market valuation of the current assets as well as any likely future assets, including paying extra consideration to HSLHL's current shareholders.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion Kiran Kumar Grandhi , Corporate Chairman of GMR Group, commented, \"We are thrilled to welcome Hampshire Cricket into the GMR family. This acquisition is a testament to our commitment to global sports and our belief in the power of cricket to unite people. We look forward to working with the Hampshire team to create a sustainable and successful future for the club.\"\n\nGMR Group has a solid history in sports, having made investments in numerous cricket clubs and tournaments across the globe. With this acquisition, GMR's standing as a significant force in the world of sports is further enhanced.\n\nExpressing his enthusiasm for the partnership, Rod Bransgrove, Chairman of HSLHL Group, said, \"This is the fulfillment of a dream for me and, I hope, for all Hampshire Cricket supporters. Beyond our team's accomplishments on the field over the past 24 years, we have transformed our stadium into a premier Test Match and events venue and one of the most exceptional cricket and leisure facilities in the country. We have also been pioneers in the development of women's cricket and have consistently innovated throughout our relatively short history. \"After a thorough selection process, we chose GGPL as our partners due to their shared values and commitment to our vision. We believe GGPL is the perfect organization, with the right people, to build on our proud legacy. Becoming the first English cricket club to join an international cricket group will open exciting new opportunities as we embrace the globalization of this great sport.\"\n\nThe GMR sports division was founded in 2008 and immediately proceeded to establish the Delhi Daredevils, the first IPL team from the capital of India. Presently, GMR owns 50% of the IPL and WPL Delhi Capitals , ILT20 Dubai Capitals, and SA20 Pretoria Capitals. In an effort to support Indian traditional sports, the spirits division has added teams to the Pro Kabaddi League and Ultimate Kho Kho League. Furthermore, GMR's sports branch has invested in the Major League Cricket (MLC) Seattle Orcas franchise.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",
