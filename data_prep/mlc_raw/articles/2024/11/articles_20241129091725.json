        "body": "We are delighted to announce the signing of Marco Jansen, who becomes the 12th member of Washington Freedom squad ahead of Major League Cricket’s launch this summer.\n\nThe 23-year-old South African bowls left-arm fast, bats aggressively and is one of the most exciting all-rounders in world cricket. He has represented his country in all three formats and is currently playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League.\n\nHe becomes the latest international player to join our roster, following in the footsteps of his international teammate Anrich Nortje and Sri Lankan all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga, who were both announced on draft day.\n\nJansen’s signing adds a further South African flavor to the Freedom squad, as he joins Nortje and Dane Piedt as players who will pull on the red, white and blue of Washington Freedom having also represented the Proteas in Test cricket.\n\nJansen has played three seasons in the IPL, first turning out for Mumbai Indians before signing for Sunrisers Hyderabad. In the latest SA20 competition, he played for Hyderabad’s sister franchise Sunrisers Eastern Cape."
