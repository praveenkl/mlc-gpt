        "body": "CSK show trust in Conway\n\nAs mentioned, the Yellow Army shelled out over ₹6 crore to get back the services of Conway. Besides the IPL, Conway has been the Super Kings's mainstay batter in Major League Cricket (MLC) and SA20. Notably, Conway was the Player of the Match in the IPL 2023 final. He scored 924 runs in 2022 and 2023 before missing the 2024 season.\n\nCSK pick Tripathi for ₹3.4 crore\n\nMaharashtra batter Rahul Tripathi, who came in at ₹75 lakh, took away ₹3.4 crore as CSK picked him. He was the day's second signing for the Yellow Army, who were involved in a bidding war with Kolkata Knight Riders. The Indian top-order batter has played for four franchises in the past - RPS, RR, KKR, and SRH.\n\nRachin earns ₹4 crore\n\nCSK gave Rachin as many as 10 matches in IPL 2024. Although the Kiwi batter didn't post big scores, he struck at a staggering 160.86. Rachin, an impactful top-order batter, also bowls left-arm finger-spin. Therefore, the Yellow Army went away with a value pick as they spent only ₹4 crore to acquire Rachin. He re-unites with his NZ teammate Conway at the CSK camp.",

        "date": "Sun Nov 24 10:28:00 2024",
        "body": "Saurabh Netravalkar had a dream season with both the United States cricket team and the Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket in 2024.\n\nNetravalkar was a part of the USA team that jointly hosted the T20 World Cup edition in June 2024. He played a key role in the home team reaching the Super 8 stage, a historic achievement in their first-ever appearance in the T20 World Cup.\n\nThe left-arm pacer finished as USA’s highest wicket-taker with a tally of six wickets from six games at an average of 20.83 and a strike rate of 18.83. But more than the wickets what stood out was Netravalkar’s economy rate and his ability to handle pressure in the grandest of stages.\n\nPlaced with India and Pakistan in Group A, and only two teams qualifying further from the group, USA would have aimed to win their remaining matches against Canada and Ireland and give something for the fans to cheer about.\n\nBut the hosts stunned Pakistan in a thrilling group game at Dallas, winning in the super-over, and opening up the entire group in the qualification process. Netravalkar bowled an impressive spell of 2/18 in four overs, which included 13 dot balls and just one hit to the fence. The Washington Freedom pacer held his nerve in the super-over as Pakistan managed only 13 and fell short by six runs.\n\nIn the group game against India, Netravalkar dismissed both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to make another memorable outing though USA lost the contest by seven wickets. That all his wickets during the World Cup came against Test-playing nations made his achievement even special in USA’s wonderful campaign.\n\nPost the World Cup, the 33-year-old Netravalkar continued in the same vein during the MLC 2024 campaign. He topped the overall bowling charts powering us to our inaugural title in the second edition of MLC this year.\n\nNetravalkar had an excellent outing picking up 15 wickets from just seven matches at an average of 13.46 and picking up a wicket at an astonishing frequency of every 10.53 balls.\n\nThe pacer has also delivered for USA in the ODI matches played as part of the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, the second level of the three-league qualification for the ODI World Cup, this year. In eight matches, Netravalkar has picked up 15 wickets at an average of 22.60 and a strike rate of 28.73.\n\nNetravalkar, who was born in Mumbai, had turned up for India in the U-19 World Cup in 2010 and was also their highest wicket-taker in the tournament. The pacer made his USA debut in March 2019 and has become the leader of their pace attack with a tally of 124 international wickets from 91 innings, across ODIs and T20Is.\n\nNetravalkar will have a key role to play in USA’s qualification for the next edition of the T20 World Cup and ODI World Cup to be played in 2026 and 2027, respectively.",
