        "title": "English Domestic Players Voice 'Frustration' Over ECB Franchise League Ban Proposal",
        "date": "Fri Nov 29 16:54:00 2024",
        "body": "English cricketers have threatened legal action against the ECB following reports that the board would ban them from appearing in franchise T20 leagues around the world.\n\nAn article published in The Telegraph today (November 29) alleged that the board would not issue NOCs (Non-objection certificates) for players to feature in T20 leagues which run alongside the English domestic season. The leagues affected would include the PSL and Major League cricket, both of which coincide with the English domestic summer. While there has been no official announcement from the ECB, the move is reportedly set to be ratified by the board next week.\n\nThe policy is allegedly being put forward in order to \"safeguard the quality of the domestic game\", amid concerns that players with higher earning potential in franchise leagues would seek higher reward elsewhere.\n\nIn response, it has been reported by ESPNcricinfo that players have threatened legal action over the move, and have requested an emergency meeting to discuss the proposal. The report states that several players who have signed white-ball only contracts with their counties and are not centrally contracted to England believe that the move is designed to restrict their opportunities.\n\nPCA interim chief executive told ESPNcricinfo: \"The PCA's legal team is currently completing a thorough check of the implementation of the policy. The PCA is continuing to source considered opinions and potential consequences of this policy from players and player representatives.\"\n\nMitchell is also quotes as citing \"clear frustration at the lack of time given for consultation, discussion and debate\" of the policy, and that players had expressed concerns about \"the inconsistencies in which players are likely to be treated\".\n\nThe PSL will run in a new window from next year, switching to April-May which will clash with the early rounds of the County Championship. As many as 16 English players are currently signed up to play in the PSL, while many other players have deals in the myriad of non-IPL franchise leagues which take place throughout the year. Major League Cricket has also emerged as a threat to The Hundred, with the two competitions significantly overlapping this year.\n\nThere was concern that, as a result, the quality of players in The Hundred was lower in 2024, with several marquee players not joining the competition until completing their contractual obligations in the US."

        "date": "Sat Nov 30 10:40:44 2024",
        "body": "English players are considering legal action against the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) amid reports of the board banning players from franchise T20 leagues. A report in The Telegraph alleged that the ECB might not issue NOCs (No-objection certificates) for players during the English domestic season.\n\nThe ECB has banned English players from participating in global franchise leagues, including the Pakistan Super League and Major League Cricket, during the domestic summer. However, the Indian Premier League is an exception to this despite its schedule overlapping with the English domestic summer.\n\nThe ECB plans to restrict players from joining franchise leagues that overlap with domestic tournaments like the Vitality Blast and The Hundred. This decision is part of protecting the quality of English domestic cricket. The policy has not yet been officially announced but is expected to be approved next week.\n\nEngland Players Frustrated Over ECB's Decision to Ban NOCs\n\nAccording to a report by ESPNcricinfo, England players have threatened legal action and called for an emergency meeting to discuss the ECB's proposed restrictions. Players who have white-ball-only county contracts, without central contracts from England, believe this move restricts their opportunities.\n\nThe report added that they are discussing their options with the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA). Daryl Mitchell, the PCA's interim chief executive, stated that the PCA's legal team is reviewing the policy and gathering feedback from players and their representatives on its potential impact.\n\n\"The PCA's legal team is currently completing a thorough check of the implementation of the policy. The PCA is continuing to source considered opinions and potential consequences of this policy from players and player representatives,\" Daryl Mitchell told ESPNcricinfo.\n\nDaryl Mitchell said that there was \"clear frustration at the lack of time given for consultation, discussion, and debate.\" He added that players had \"strongly expressed their concerns\" and raised concerns about \"the inconsistencies in which players are likely to be treated.\"\n\nEngland Players to Miss Pakistan Super League\n\nThe Pakistan Super League will be played in the April-May window next year due to the 2025 Champions Trophy being held in Pakistan and will clash with the early rounds of the County Championship. 16 English players are already signed for the PSL, with many others committed to various non-IPL leagues.\n\nMajor League Cricket and Caribbean Premier League\n\nIn the 2024 Major League Cricket, Jason Roy was the only England player. He missed part of Surrey's T20 Blast campaign to play in the MLC. He would not receive an NOC in 2025 under new rules. Alex Hales was the only English player in the 2024 Lanka Premier League, which also overlapped with the T20 Blast.\n\nThe Caribbean Premier League (CPL) also clashes with the T20 Blast's knockout stages. Players from eliminated teams may still join the CPL tournament. In 2024, the ECB worked with Cricket West Indies to avoid a clash between the CPL and The Hundred so that players could be available for both events."
