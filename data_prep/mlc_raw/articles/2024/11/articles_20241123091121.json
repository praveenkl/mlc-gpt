Goenka has worked closely with Smith before, having appointed him as the captain of the Rising Pune Supergiants in 2017, a decision that nearly led to an IPL title.\n\nWith KL Rahul departing from the team, Smith’s experience in leadership and his strategic insights could prove crucial. Additionally, his inclusion at the top of the batting order would bolster LSG’s attacking strength.\n\nRajasthan Royals (RR)\n\nThe Rajasthan Royals may be interested in bringing back Steven Smith, given his successful tenure with the team from 2014-15 and 2019-20. During this period, Smith not only impressed with his batting but also captained the side, leading them to several important victories. His familiarity with the franchise and its culture could make his reintegration smoother. A return to Rajasthan might also help revive his form and contribute to further successes.
