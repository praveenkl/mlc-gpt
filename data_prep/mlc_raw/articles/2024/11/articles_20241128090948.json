Despite pairing with Ricky Ponting as Washington Freedom's captain and coach to win Major League Cricket in the USA Punter wasn't keen on taking another punt on Smith.\n\nInstead Ponting packed his new Punjab Kings team with other Aussies, signing Josh Inglis, Aaron Hardie and Xavier Bartlett to join Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis who were acquired on day one.\n\nNor was there any interest in English bowling veteran James Anderson. Seeking to make an IPL debut at the age of 42 he did not even come up in the bidding.\n\nInstead the headline act was an unknown, 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who was sold for $200,000 to Rajasthan Royals.\n\nThe youngster, who made his debut in India's domestic Ranji Trophy at 12, hit a 58-ball hundred in the youth Test against Australia U19s in October, but made one and three in his other innings in the two-match series.\n\nğ�—” ğ�—µğ�—¶ğ�˜€ğ�˜�ğ�—¼ğ�—¿ğ�—¶ğ�—° ğ�—ºğ�—¼ğ�—ºğ�—²ğ�—»ğ�˜� ğ�—¶ğ�—» ğ�˜�ğ�—µğ�—² â€” IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) #TATAIPLAuction! ğŸ‘� ğŸ‘�ğ�˜¿ğ�™Š ğ�™‰ğ�™Šğ�™� ğ�™ˆğ�™„ğ�™�ğ�™�: Here's how the 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi - the youngest ever player to be bought in the auction - joined #RR ğŸ‘Œ ğŸ‘Œ#TATAIPL | @rajasthanroyals pic.twitter.com/eme92pM7jyNovember 25, 2024\n\nThe biggest-earning Australian on day two was Tim David, the big-hitting all-rounder joining Royal Challengers Bengaluru for $550,000.\n\nClose behind was Spencer Johnson. He was a Ponting target but Kings were outbid by Kolkata Knight Riders who offered $510,000.Â\n\nHowever, Ponting did then land Hardie for $225,000 and, after missing out on Nathan Ellis (who went to Chennai Super Kings for $365,000), signed Bartlett, the top wicket-taker in BBL last summer, for $145,000.\n\nTim David was the most expensive Australian on day two of the IPL auction, picking up $550,000. (Linda Higginson/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nPonting had begun by signing the only one of the three Aussie keepers on the market to be sold.Â\n\nAlex Carey may be Australia's Test wicketkeeper but Inglis has the gloves in the whiteball game and it showed as he went for $475,000.\n\nCarey was next up after Inglis, with a $180,000 base price, but there were no bidders. Another gloveman, Josh Philippe, would later also go unsold.\n\nThere were also no bids for Jason Behrendorff, Matt Short and Lance Morris while other Australians who had put themselves forward did not even make the bidding stage.\n\nThere is hope, though, for them and for the likes of Warner and Smith as between now and March players will inevitably be injured or, for personal reasons, pull out, creating late vacancies.\n\nThe biggest signing of the day was Bhuvneshwar Kumar who joined Royal Challengers Bengaluru for $2 million.\n\nIn a separate development Daniel Sams signed for English county Nottinghamshire in the domestic 20-over league.Â\n\nThe 32-year-old played for Trent Rockets, who are also based at Trent Bridge, in the 2022 and 2023 Hundred competition.\n\nAUSTRALIANS IN IPL\n\nChennai Super Kings: Nathan Ellis.\n\nDelhi Capitals: Mitch Starc, Jake Fraser-McGurk.\n\nKolkata Knight Riders: Spencer Johnson.\n\nLucknow Super Giants: Justin Langer (coach), Mitch Marsh.\n\nPunjab Kings: Ricky Ponting (coach), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis, Aaron Hardie, Xavier Bartlett.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru: Josh Hazlewood, Tim David.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Pat Cummins, Travis Head, Adam Zampa.\n\nNone: Gujurat Titans, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals.",
