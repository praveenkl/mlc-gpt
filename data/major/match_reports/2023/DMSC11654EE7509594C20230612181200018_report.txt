The Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas played host to an exciting T20 match between SEA and TSK, where SEA emerged victorious by 9 wickets. Winning the toss, TSK opted to bat first, hoping to capitalize on a firm wicket. However, TSK struggled to build momentum, managing to put up a modest total of 126/9 in their allotted 20 overs. Notable contributions came from Daniel Sams who scored 26 off 25 balls, Devon Conway with 24 off 19 balls, and Cody Chetty who added 24 off 21 balls.

SEA's bowlers, particularly Andrew Tye, were instrumental in restricting TSK. Tye delivered a standout performance with figures of 3/32 from his 4 overs. Complementing him, Imad Wasim dazzled with 2/23 in his 4 overs, and Harmeet Singh kept it tight with 1/16 from his full quota. Cameron Gannon also chipped in by taking a wicket and conceding 19 runs in his 2 overs.

Chasing 127, SEA lost an early wicket with Nauman Anwar departing for 2 runs off 6 balls. However, Quinton de Kock, the man of the match, took charge with a masterful 88 off 50 balls, ensuring no further mishaps. His commanding innings included 4 fours and 3 sixes, underscoring his match-winning credentials. Partnering him, Shehan Jayasuriya anchored the chase with a steady 31 off 34 balls, guiding SEA to a comfortable win in just 15 overs.

The SEA’s innings saw key milestones being achieved at regular intervals. At the 12.4 over mark, they were cruising at 102/1, with Jayasuriya hitting a notable four off Calvin Savage. Earlier, at 7.2 overs, Jayasuriya had also bisected the field with a boundary off Mohammad Mohsin, taking SEA to 51/1.

Quinton de Kock’s 50 came up in spectacular fashion, reaching the half-century mark in 31 balls with a towering six off Gerald Coetzee. His powerful hitting not only demoralized the TSK bowlers but also thrilled the spectators in Dallas.

TSK's bowlers found it challenging to contain SEA's explosive batting line-up. Rusty Theron was the only TSK bowler to get a wicket, ending with figures of 1/20 in his 3 overs. The rest including Mitchell Santner, Milind Kumar, and Daniel Sams struggled to make breakthroughs, leaking runs.

TSK’s milestones were reached with more toil, with their innings punctuated by SEA's disciplined bowling. By 8.1 overs, TSK reached 50/2, and at 17 overs, they limped to 100/6, both milestones illustrating their grinding effort at the crease amidst tight bowling.

In summary, it was an all-round performance by SEA that saw them securing a decisive victory. Quinton de Kock's exceptional innings was the highlight of the match, duly earning him the Man of the Match award. The SEA bowlers set the stage early, and the batsmen finished the job clinically to outclass TSK and notch up a memorable win in the MLC tournament.
