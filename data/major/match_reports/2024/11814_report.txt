The clash at Grand Prairie Stadium saw the Washington Freedom take on the San Francisco Unicorns in a thrilling Major League Cricket (MLC) encounter. Washington Freedom won the toss and opted to field, a decision that paid dividends as they secured a convincing victory by 7 wickets to top off a memorable day for their supporters.

Batting first, the San Francisco Unicorns posted a total of 145/10 in 19 overs. The standout for the Unicorns was Hassan Khan, who played a sublime knock of 57 off 36 balls, including five towering sixes, a testimony to his power-hitting prowess. His efforts were complemented by Corey Anderson’s 26 off 19 balls, but the rest of the batting lineup struggled to make significant contributions. Washington Freedom’s bowlers were exhilarating, led by Rachin Ravindra’s exceptional figures of 4/11 in 2.4 overs, dismantling the Unicorns’ batting order with precision. Marco Jansen also impressed with 3/46 in his full quota of 4 overs, while Saurabh Netravalkar chipped in with 2/23 from 4 overs. Lockie Ferguson took a vital wicket, ending with figures of 1/24 from 3.2 overs.
