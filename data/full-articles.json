  "body": "Major League Cricket started strongly (AP Photo/LM Otero)\nHaving \"exceeded all expectations\", with stirring contests in front of heaving crowds helping surpass its financial targets, the historic Major League Cricket has the foundations to build on as it eyes an expanded second season.\nThe debut of the well-heeled T20 tournament, as cricket seriously enters the world's biggest sports market, was deemed a resounding success. Even no nonsense Sunil Gavaskar, the Indian cricket legend and broadcaster at the MLC, was left impressed.\n\"He (Gavaskar) told me the quality of the cricket was high,\" Anand Rajaraman, San Francisco Unicorns co-owner, told me. \"He felt the international players were giving it their all and that the pitches were good, which is a ringing endorsement.\n\"The overseas players said the ground and pitch in Dallas was as good as anywhere they've played around the world.\n\"The tournament exceeded all expectations.\"\nThere was much anticipation over the MLC's launch with a lot riding on it considering the maligned status of American cricket over the years.\nWith over $100 million invested, aided by influential Indian businessmen some of whom are ensconced in Silicon Valley, the six-team tournament was able to lure high-profile international cricketers through attractive salaries.\nWith the U.S. home to a growing South Asian populace, there were plenty of passionate cricket fans eager to watch the matches in person even though some of the matches were rather bafflingly played in the sweltering Dallas heat.\nMore than 70,000 fans turned out to the 18-day tournament played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the rather modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nThe MLC attracted plenty of fans in its debut season (AP Photo/LM Otero)\nThe broadcast was beamed to 87 countries worldwide and importantly some games were shown live on CBS Sports Network in the U.S.\n\"The tournament had revenues of around $8 million,\" said Rajaraman, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. \"Was more than we anticipated...we thought it would be lucky to make $5 million in the first season.\n\"We had a lot of sponsors reaching out. It was a success but there are learnings. Scheduling afternoon games was not ideal, they were hard to sell.\"\nThe MLC has been debriefing its first season with the tournament expected to announce its plans for the 2024 edition in the coming months.\nThe emotion from tournament administrators was understandable relief, knowing the tournament had lived up to the hype and avoided being the type of fool's gold project long associated with the tempestuous American cricket scene.\nBut there is much to work out before a defining second season hot on the heels of the landmark T20 World Cup in June, which will be co-hosted by the U.S. with matches played in New York, Dallas and Florida.\nA proper home and away season, where teams play each other twice, is on the cards, while there is hope the salary cap for the teams will rise, further enticing cricketers many of whom are already intrigued by playing on the big sports stage of the U.S.\nThere is an unknown over player drafts and movements, with those playing in the first edition having signed one-year contracts with options to extend.\n\"The ownership group in the MLC would like the next season to be a full season, but scheduling will be important,\" Rajaraman said. \"It will have to be after the T20 World Cup but not impact other (T20) leagues in August.\n\"It should last around a month and would need double headers, but hopefully not too many games played in the heat.\"\nAs expected, the tournament relied on the star power from its overseas signings to ensure the matches felt pretty similar in standard to most of the other T20 leagues cramming the cricket calendar.\nTeams were allowed six overseas players per starting eleven - more than the quota of four accepted in established leagues. Amid an outcry, fearing the sanctity of international cricket, governing body the ICC has tightened regulations with teams in official T20 leagues only allowed to field four overseas players.\nThis new rule does not come into effect for the MLC or the newly formed cashed-up UAE league, but there is an understanding that homegrown heroes need to be created for the tournament to truly resonate amongst the local populace.\n\"We have to get to four,\" Rajaraman said. \"There is no discussion on timeframe, it will probably be six to five to four. It (four) is the right place to be.\n\"It was amazing for the domestic players, exposure many had never dreamed of having. They will be much better for the experience.\"\nMajor League Cricket was passionately followed (AP Photo/LM Otero)\nTo grow the tournament beyond a South Asian audience, as these newly formed franchises fight for air amid the congested American sports market, teams will need home grounds in a bid to build a connection with their communities.\nSignificant infrastructure is required, a daunting task given cricket is played on bigger grounds than baseball and requiring a pitch in the middle. For the Unicorns, a stadium in Santa Clara is in the works, but a temporary venue could be used next season.\n\"We had a fan event before the MLC in Freemont on the east bay and we had over 1200 people show up,\" Rajaraman said. \"We organized some watch parties in bars in the Bay Arena, there was an enthusiastic showing.\n\"Clearly there is interest and we are confident if we do have home games in the Bay Area, we would sell them out. Easily.\"\nExpectations will inevitably rise further, but there is little concern over complacency creeping in with everyone knowing the daunting task ahead with cricket desperate for visibility in its favored target market.\n\"We were just holding our breath on this tournament,\" Rajaraman said. \"We got this tournament to where we thought we would get to in the second or third year.\n\"There was a novelty factor in the first season, which won't be there in the second season. We have to consciously build on what we've started.\"\n"

  "body": "As Major League Cricket’s inaugural tournament concludes with its championship match on Sunday, its cadre of wealthy investors remain as bullish on its potential in America as ever\nAs Texan cricket tycoons go, Anurag Jain certainly cuts a more credible figure than Allen Stanford, the disgraced financier and Twenty20 promoter who notoriously landed a helicopter at Lord’s in 2008 and flaunted a crate that he claimed held $20m in cash.\nStanford, the flash, brash neocolonial chancer born near Waco, who sought to shape a cricketing empire from his base in Antigua, is serving a 110-year prison sentence in a Florida prison after his 2012 conviction in a Houston court for running a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.\nJain, meanwhile, grew up watching and playing cricket in India before moving to Dallas, starting a healthcare technology company and founding a venture capital firm with Ross Perot Jr, former owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and son of the late businessman who ran for president in the 1990s. They are investors in the Texas Super Kings, one of six Major League Cricket (MLC) teams in the inaugural tournament, which ends on Sunday with its championship match in Grand Prairie, midway between Dallas and Fort Worth.\n“This has been the best start-up I’ve ever done,” Jain beamed from outside a buzzy stadium suite where yellow-clad Kings fans mingled on Thursday ahead of a nine-wicket defeat to the Seattle Orcas, for whom the South African international Quinton de Kock bashed an undefeated 88.\nWhile Stanford came across as a Barnum with bails, the numerous wealthy and influential MLC investors, many of them of South Asian heritage and with technology backgrounds, are more modest and methodical. With an initial outlay of $120m and much infrastructure to build, this is not a get-rich-quick scheme.\n“We have a very clear path to where we think the league and the teams are going to be break-even and then profitable from then on … in a very realistic timeframe. We are not talking 10 years or anything like that. We would like to see that happen in the three-to-five-year horizon,” said Vijay Srinivasan, co-founder of MLC and of Willow TV, an American cricket pay-TV channel.\n“We are nowhere close to finishing our venues so there’s a lot of capital lined up to go into that,” he added. “This season was a short season, we do want to play a more robust home and away format so we’ll expand the league, more games, more venues.”\nTexas has a large South Asian population, with about half of the state’s 450,000 Indian Americans living in the Dallas area. “There is a good springboard of Indian, South Asian and Commonwealth diaspora that are here,” Jain said. “Eventually we’ll explore other markets just like soccer did in the US 30 years ago.”\nCrowds have been good, with several sell-outs, but MLC only used two grounds this year: the bucolic but modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, and the 7,200-capacity Grand Prairie Stadium. Finished in a rush just in time for the first game on 13 July, the converted minor league baseball stadium still bears faint traces of its past as the home of the now-defunct Texas AirHogs, from a board on a wall at the main entrance to the baseball motifs in the adjacent playground.\nThe Foodistaan Sports Bar \u0026 Grill looms beyond the boundary by one of the sight screens. Concessions outlets sold biryani and burgers, samosas and garlic fries. Also fried were the players, officials and few hundred fans who sizzled in the 102F (39C) heat during Thursday’s eliminator between the Washington Freedom and MI New York, which started at 3.30pm. It is absurd to hold any outdoor sporting event in Texas on a mid-afternoon in July, let alone with the region, like much of the nation, baking under a high heat warning.\nStill, falling in the southern hemisphere winter, the relatively quiet month allowed organizers to attract high-level talent such as De Kock, his countryman Faf du Plessis, and the Australians, Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch, as well as the West Indians, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell and Dwayne Bravo, to take the field alongside unknown domestic players.\nSanjay Govil, an IT entrepreneur who is the Freedom owner, said overseas players are enticed by the opportunity to spend a few weeks in the US – and by salaries that are on a par with high-grade T20 leagues around the world. England’s Jason Roy reportedly agreed a $400,000 two-year MLC deal – generous by any standards, and especially so since his contribution to the last-place Los Angeles Knight Riders this month amounted to three innings in which he scored 45, 7 and 2.\nMLC prepared for the tournament with a combine at a cricket complex near Houston built by an immigrant from Pakistan who made his fortune operating American fast-food franchises, and a player draft at Space Center Houston a few cover drives from mission control at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center.\n“I’m pleasantly surprised with all the quality of players that we’ve had, so many international stars,” said Damodhar Bhat, an India-born 42-year-old IT professional and cricket lover who travelled from Seattle with his son to watch Thursday’s doubleheader. “This looks very promising. I really wish it sticks around and hope that it does.”\nFor now, Grand Prairie is a temple where MLC preaches to the converted, but the 2024 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting with the West Indies, is an opportunity to promote the gospel. So too, above all, is the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, should cricket join the slate of sports.\nIf summers broiled by climate change are a challenge, another defining aspect of modern life, globalization, is an opportunity. “I do this ‘poll’, whenever I’m in an Uber, taxi, car, whatever. I’ve never heard of anybody who’s not heard of cricket. It’s a very connected world,” said Govil above the hum of an air-conditioning unit, pausing to stand for a rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner, hand over heart.\n“I think there’s going to be a huge evolution in how cricket is going to be played in the future. We had failed attempts with Kerry Packer and West Indies and so on and so forth. But I think the game has evolved a lot more and there’s a lot more commercial interest now thanks to the IPL and other leagues like The Hundred and the Big Bash.”\nIt is only 20 years since the T20 format debuted professionally in England and fifteen since the Indian Premier League was born. “The game has changed. The game has become shorter, faster, funner,” Jain said. “People like action … Offense, defense, all the time.”\nIt’s also created a more democratic environment; or at least a more capitalistic one. “You don’t have to be the best Test-playing country to be seen as a player on the global landscape,” Srinivasan said. “If you can put together a high-quality T20 tournament with the best players in the world and the highest standards then there’s a place for you.”\nWillow TV has broadcast games in the US along with the CBS Sports Network, with several other countries also airing live contests. High-end production values have included slick graphics and a range of camera angles. The former India great Sunil Gavaskar, one of the television commentators, examined the pitch on Thursday wearing a cowboy hat.\nTexas now has a cricket team named after the Chennai Super Kings, an IPL team based nearly 10,000 miles away. It might be a dubious branding decision in a place that had a distinctly strained relationship with its last monarch. But perhaps it’s not so odd in the broader context.\nCulture clash is not the right phrase for what’s happening in Major League Cricket. This is not a collision. It’s a combination. A blending, the logical outcome of modern media and mass migration, horizons widening as technology erodes boundaries.\nA post-pandemic backlash against globalism is impacting how the world creates and consumes all kinds of stuff. But not in sports, where the international TV and digital content supply chains remain sturdy, market forces rule, workers are peripatetic and power and profits are increasingly interconnected across frontiers. After all, earlier in the week, North American-owned Wrexham played North American-owned Manchester United in San Diego and Saudi Arabia (its world golf conquest ongoing) signed Liverpool’s captain.\nFour MLC teams are tied to IPL entities while the other two partnered with Australian regional federations. Sports gambling is illegal in Texas, among other states, but, underlining the importance of overseas viewers, an international online betting company is a major sponsor of the league.\n“Whatever we do, whoever the owners are, ultimately this is an American league, it’s an American product,” Jain insisted, pointing out that matches were timed to appeal to US prime-time viewers.\n“Our line-ups, all of them have a strong US domestic component, so this is a platform for growing American cricket in all respects. This is not meant to be anything other than that,” Srinivasan said. “We’re adding more venues. Increasing the standard of the domestic US pool. Some US players have had significant match-changing performances in this tournament which is a good thing, I think. What we’ll see is that’s going to lead to a more competitive US team like the IPL did for the domestic Indian player pool.”\nOverall, he argued, MLC is “truly what the US is – it’s an amalgamation of a lot of things. I think that’s the identity of our league.”"

(AP Photo Surjeet Yadav, File)\nGeorge Bernard Shaw asserted “the English are not very spiritual people so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.”\nIt has been a long game, traditionally.\nWhile cricket has flourished in England and some of its former colonies, it has never taken off to the same degree in the United States, where some have perceived it as impenetrable. \nA sport played in its purist form by players in long white uniforms, test cricket goes on for five days and still often ends with no winner, with days so long players twice have to leave the field for meals.\nMajor League Cricket, which begins on Thursday, could change that perception. For a start, the games only go for just over three hours.\n\n        \n    \nMLC will comprise six teams, from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, New York and Washington, which will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\nTeams will have a maximum of 19 and minimum of 16 players, combining international stars and home-grown players selected through a draft which was made when the league was launched, officially and metaphorically, at Space Center Houston. Each team was allowed to sign nine local players, one of which had to be under-23.\nThe salaries of international players will be drawn from an initial $120 million investment from corporate backers, mainly from India.\nThe teams will play Twenty20 style which might be portrayed as cricket with the dull bits removed. The format may be more appealing to the American sport palate because there is always a winner: if the teams are still tied after both innings — each comprising 20 six-ball overs — a tie-breaking “super over” is played to find the winner.\nMost matches will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, converted to a cricket stadium with 7,200 seats and a grass pitch. Other matches will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nThe league follows the model of professional Twenty20 — or more broadly known as T20 — leagues which already exist in places such as India, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Canada. They’re all supported by a travelling troupe of international players — many of them T20 specialists — who give leagues marquee quality.\nThe most lucrative and glamorous of all these franchise competitions is the Indian Premier League, where the world’s best players are hired by teams owned by Bollywood stars, business giants and other celebrities. The gravitational pull of the IPL has reshaped cricket’s traditional schedules and made many new cricketing millionaires.\nMajor League Cricket inevitably will have some of the Indian Premier League glitz. Four of the six teams are owned and will be run by IPL franchises.\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders will be run by the Knight Riders Group which operate the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. MI New York will be run by the Mumbai Indians, Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas by the GMR Group which runs the Delhi Capitals.\nTwo of Australia’s provincial organizations — Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales — will run the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom respectively.\nMany of the biggest stars from India, Australia and England are involved in test series — more of those five-day matches — but MLC has attracted a strong contingent of seasoned T20 performers.\nBollywood star Shah Rukh Khan co-owns the Knight Riders Group and has recruited West Indies stars Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, England’s Jason Roy, South Africa’s Rilee Rossouw, Australian Adam Zampa and New Zealanders Lockie Ferguson and Martin Guptill.\n“We have assembled a strong and talented team for the debut season of MLC who can compete at the highest level and bring joy to cricket fans around the world,” Knight Riders Group chief executive Venky Mysore said.\nThe Texas Super Kings have hired South Africa’s Faf du Plessis as captain alongside international stars Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, David Miller, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee.\nChennai Super Kings chief executive K.S. Viswanathan said du Plessis “led the Joburg Super Kings at (the South African T20 league) from the front earlier this year and we’re confident of doing well under him in Texas.”\nThe West Indies and Mumbai Indians star Kieron Pollard will captain New York, which will have Robin Peterson as head coach and Lasith Malinga as bowling coach. Their signings include fast bowlers Trent Boult from New Zealand and Kagiso Rabada from South Africa.\nSeattle has Australian star Mitch Marsh and South Africa’s Quinton de Kock.\nMLC has broader ambitions, to build minor leagues in a bid to develop training and development facilities and support the U.S. national team.\nNow it remains to be seen whether American fans will find Major League Cricket to their taste and make the league itself everlasting.\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

It is like any other Minor League, Major League Baseball, but not just on that grand scale yet.\"\nHowever, Peter Della Penna, a former ESPN cricket writer, said the MLC has failed to cater to the sporting culture of the U.S. and has not done much to cultivate organic support from the general American public.\n\"A lot of the tickets have been given away as gifts to the families of the cricket players and organizers to fill in the stadium for the opening night,\" he said. \"There has been little to no effort made in terms of initiating grassroot level effort.\"\nPenna has been covering cricket in the U.S. for the past 18 years. He said that MLC's approach of developing cricket in the country is not different from that of USA Cricket (the men's and women's national cricket teams), as both have depended largely on migration patterns instead of building an organic pathway like other sports.\n\"There are a lot of people immigrating to participate in MLC but what does that say about the health and sustainability of the league and cricket more broadly in the country,\" Penna said. \"Instead of bringing in international stars that no Americans know about, cricket should rather be introduced as a high school league first which will create a pathway for it to be a NCAA Division 1 scholarship sport.\"\n\nAn earlier version of this story misspelled the last name of Zubin Surkari as Sarkari.\n\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

  "body": "Major League Cricket’s co-founder talks to Al Jazeera about the new venture, the US market and the spread of the sport in the US.\nA sell-out crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas last week witnessed the opening match of cricket’s latest T20 league, the Major League Cricket (MLC) that is taking place in the United States.\nSo far, the 200-mark has been crossed twice, a side has been bowled out for 50 and the temperature has crossed the 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) barrier amid a heatwave that hit the US state.\nThe MLC, founded in 2019 but launched in 2023, kicked off 16 years after the inaugural T20 World Cup and 15 years after the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is now the world’s biggest domestic T20 cricket league.\nAs the MLC moves from Texas to North Carolina, MLC’s co-founder Sameer Mehta spoke to Al Jazeera on how the league plans to stand out among the crowd, break into the sport-heavy US market and if cricket can win American hearts.\nAl Jazeera: MLC is not the first T20 league and definitely won’t be the last. How do you plan on making it stand out in the crowd?\nSameer Mehta: From my time running Willow TV [an online subscription-based viewing service], we realised that the US is a very, very viable market for cricket. There’s a strong audience here, especially the eight million expats. Now we have immense hunger from probably the best investors in the world, we’re building our own stadiums, we’ll be playing in the summer when there’s not much cricket going on and we have the second largest salary cap in the world alongside a few other leagues.\nWhat we really have are the 400 million people in the US that are going to discover the sport at some point. They will fall in love with the sport. For every fan we have, if we can get one more mainstream fan to be a fan of cricket, we will be the second or third biggest market in the world. That’s the ambition.\nIt’s not just to run a T20 league, there are plenty of those around the world, but to be up there and the mainstream Americans to follow the sport.\nAl Jazeera: Mainstream Americans have plenty on their hands right now with NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS and golf, among others. How confident are you that they will take up cricket?\nMehta: It will take time. The Indians and the Pakistanis will be the first fans. It’s our first season. We’ve just launched. We want to make sure we get the product right this year. Our absolute goal is that next year, when we have a full season, we want to market very heavily to the mainstream American fans and make them fall in love with the sport.\nThis country is a country of franchise sport. Every sports fan here is used to following three, four, five franchise teams. Even in football, all the top teams are franchises. Cricket should be no different.\nWe don’t want to compete with them [MLB, NBA]. We want to thrive off them. Americans are obsessed about sport. When they follow a sport, they follow it grandly. In this country, where the economics, the revenue, the way sport is handled, the way broadcast rights are handled, the way players are treated, it is just mind-boggling. If we have a slice of it, I’m more than happy. I don’t need to compete with football or basketball. We have a beautiful bat-and-ball game and the T20 version is perfect for the US audience. The sky is the limit out here.\nAl Jazeera: T20 cricket has been around for a while. Why has it taken a long time for a league to be launched in this market?\nMehta: I feel like things happen at the right time. Our view was when T20 took off and built roots, it matured to a point where it has become a world-class product.\nWe decided to launch the league in 2017-18. It took a little bit of time to make sure the ICC and everyone else was fully on board. We also did not want to play in makeshift stadiums. We said if we’re going to do it, we’ll do it properly. I don’t think it’s been that long, there’s no urgency to it. The sport has matured, it took T20 a decade to find its feet and now it is the dominant version of cricket in the world. T20 is where the world is shifting to and as far as the US is concerned, it’s the absolute right sport for the market.\nAmericans like to root for a team in the place they live in. American sport is hyper-local and that’s what you want to bring to franchise cricket.\nAl Jazeera: MLC is now being seen as a product to help promote the sport in the US. How do you feel about that and what role should the governing body play?\nMehta: As I said earlier, this country is one of franchise sport. If you want to come to the US, you have to play franchise sport, otherwise the sport can go elsewhere. Here, the only way to do it is via private capital and private stadiums. The governing bodies should do what they do and should absolutely try and collaborate with us … on usage of facilities and so on for the national teams. Franchises do things differently and are willing to invest and that’s how franchise sport is so popular. Governing bodies have smaller budgets and that’s not how a sport grows in the US. Frankly, both sides need each other.\nIn India, Pakistan and all those countries, the governing bodies have been around for a long time and receive massive budgets. For a new country like the US, where will they get any government assistance? It won’t happen. Private capital has to do it.\nAl Jazeera: What’s next for the MLC then? What will it look like post season 1?\nMehta: We’re moving very, very fast. Next year will be a full season. Right now, we’re playing at two venues. We’re hoping to expand that to four next year which is also the Cricket World Cup year in the US. That’ll bring a lot of attention to the sport and the league. Hopefully we’ll be able to share venues with the World Cup organisers and vice versa.\nThe plan is for each team to have a permanent home venue by 2025 or 2026. We feel pretty confident that by 2026, each team will be applying home and away. You have got to have local fans. Once we become the top three to four financial nations in the world in terms of cricket, the cricketers will follow… and the sport will grow to a point where five to seven years from now, we can be at the top.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

  "body": "\nHow South Asian business leaders are turning Texas into the next global hot spot for the world’s second-biggest sport.\n\n\nTom Foster writes about business, innovation, and creative people.\n\nA few miles west of where Houston’s highway sprawl fades from a parade of superstores into the steamy low countryside, a slight rise in U.S. 290 reveals a surprise: six perfect circles of close-cropped grass clustered on the prairie like petals on an enormous flower. Here, spread across 86 acres and just an hour’s drive from the heart of the city, the nation’s largest and most advanced collection of cricket grounds attracts hundreds of athletes every week from around the Houston area—and often from around the country. \nThis is the Prairie View Cricket Complex, and on a recent Sunday, as the national junior cricket championships unfolded before him, the Texan who envisioned this place and paid to build it took a seat on the metal bleachers to explain how it all happened, and what it signified. Sporting mirrored aviator sunglasses, a body-hugging T-shirt, and a carefully groomed field of salt-and-pepper stubble, Tanweer Ahmed quickly rolled the clock back to 1988, when he arrived in this country from Pakistan at age twenty, with $23 to his name. \nHe’d come for the American dream but quickly realized there would be no handouts, he said. He took two jobs, one at a gas station and one at a Jack in the Box, and started learning English by watching American movies, especially The Terminator. He’d been working since he was ten years old back in Pakistan, selling vegetables from his family’s farm outside the city of Sialkot, and he’d managed to pay for two years of college there as well—so he was quick to impress his American bosses. By 1991 KFC hired Ahmed as a store manager. He was on his way.\nToday Ahmed, who lives in Houston, is one of the country’s largest fast-food franchise owners, with some four hundred KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell restaurants in four states. His passion, though, is cricket. And beginning about five years ago, he decided it was time to start paying his success forward—by investing heavily in the sport in Texas and building the Prairie View complex. “The whole idea that I have is, I came to this country, this country blessed me, and now I owe something back,” he told me. \nCricket is the world’s second-most-popular sport, Ahmed explained, with more than a billion fans, the vast majority of them from the Indian subcontinent. Meanwhile, Indians, Pakistanis, and other South Asians today make up the fastest-growing demographic group in the U.S., at 5.4 million strong. And Texas has the country’s second-largest South Asian population, just behind California and ahead of New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. The math wasn’t hard: cricket was wildly underrepresented in the nation’s landscape of recreational opportunities. \nAhmed’s complex in Prairie View is one of many in the U.S.—with a crucial but subtle difference. At the center of each circular field, under a rectangle of even finer turf, lies a layer of clay soil that has been rolled so flat and hard that a leather cricket ball will bounce as if on concrete—a differentiator from baseball because of how many variables this feature introduces to pitching and batting. Most of the other U.S. cricket grounds use artificial grass for the infield playing surface, a cost-saving measure that purists say just doesn’t offer the same quality of bounce. In Plano, Russell Creek Park claims to be the only park in the country with seven cricket fields, all with synthetic infields. Ahmed, ever the entrepreneur, saw an opportunity to level up. \nHe wasn’t the only Texas businessman to see an angle. Around the time Ahmed was starting his management career with KFC, another South Asian immigrant, Anurag Jain, was beginning business school at the University of Michigan. Jain, who moved to the U.S. from Chennai, India, when he was in his early twenties, had grown up as a talented but raw cricketer who dreamed of playing professionally but who instead followed his father’s advice to pursue a more sensible career.\nAs Jain earned an MBA and embarked upon a career as an entrepreneur in health-care IT, he fed his cricket addiction by getting up at three or four in the morning to watch live matches broadcast from the other side of the planet—a ritual shared by many of his South Asian peers in this country. “We’ve got this strange dual life where we’ve tried to keep in touch with cricket while we live our normal lives in the U.S.,” he told me. He longed to find his way back to the sport in a bigger way and loved the idea of building up American cricket—”but for the longest time it was just too much money.”\nThen Plano-based Perot Systems, an IT firm created by Ross Perot and his son, bought one of Jain’s first companies, Vision Healthsource, in 2003. Jain moved to the Dallas area, and he and Ross Perot Jr. began investing in other projects together. That was right as the sport of cricket itself began to change. Traditionally, a single match lasted five days, and even then it often didn’t result in a winner. A one-day format emerged in the 1970s, but it wasn’t until 2003 that another change allowed matches to be completed in three and a half hours—a format known as T20 cricket. The Indian Premier League debuted in 2008, and it quickly turned T20 matches into the kind of live television Western audiences are used to, complete with cheerleaders and Bollywood celebrity appearances. Seemingly overnight, a gentleman’s pursuit turned into a high-scoring bat-and-ball sport that made baseball look sleepy. “And that,” said Jain, “became the future of the sport.”\nBy the late 2010s, he and Ross Jr. had set up a venture capital firm, Perot Jain, and built a strong professional network in Silicon Valley. That’s where Jain found his opportunity: a start-up called Major League Cricket. Ahmed, as it turned out, discovered the same opportunity at about the same time.\nAs Ahmed and Jain were starting to dream of a thriving cricket culture in Texas, two tech entrepreneurs in the Bay Area, Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, were looking at the same trends and dreaming of a media and sports empire. They’d left their start-up jobs in the early aughts and launched a pay-TV channel dedicated to cricket. Willow TV, named for the type of wood in a cricket bat, didn’t become an immediate household name in the U.S., but it didn’t need to: by aggregating matches from around the world for Western audiences, the network turned the U.S. into the world’s fourth-largest cricket media market. \nThe number of talented cricketers emerging in India to play in the IPL had meanwhile started to outpace the number of opportunities in the league, and players began looking for jobs in other cricket-loving areas—Australia, the Caribbean, England, South Africa. That’s when Mehta and Srinivasan hit on the idea to start a professional league in the U.S., and Major League Cricket was born. They’d already proven a fan base existed here, so why not bring those supporters an original product? And if Major League Soccer could set its sights on eventually competing for attention with professional baseball and basketball, why not cricket? \nThe idea isn’t as far-fetched as it might sound. Cricket has a long history in the U.S. There’s even evidence of George Washington’s troops playing “wickets” at Valley Forge in 1778. That makes sense, because the sport spread with British imperialism as a way to inculcate British values in colonial subjects. Cricket faded in the U.S. in the late 1800s as baseball took hold, largely because the American game didn’t require the same kind of perfectly flattened and groomed turf. But now that so many new Americans come from India and other parts of the former British empire, there’s a  natural symmetry to cricket’s contemporary return. \nAs word of Mehta and Srinivasan’s plan spread through the loose network of U.S.-based South Asian business leaders, it quickly found its way to Jain and Ahmed, both of whom signed on as investors in a $44 million round of funding by the league. Also piling money into MLC from its earliest days were Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Adobe Chairman and CEO Shantanu Narayan, and the principals of major venture-capital firms such as Madrona Venture Group and Rocketship VC.\nIt was a powerful group of people, all of whom brought their own considerable egos and financial ambitions, but all of whom also shared an underlying passion for the game that ran much deeper than the dollars at stake. “It’s sort of a badge of honor,” the league’s head of marketing, Tom Dunmore, told me. “American cricket is fortunate that many people who love it are immigrants who have come here and done well, and they can afford to invest in the sport or build a cricket pitch.” It’s different from soccer, he pointed out, because you can’t just whip up a game on any old playing surface. “But there’s a lot of community benefit that comes with setting up and maintaining cricket infrastructure.” \nEven with all of their competing interests, it didn’t take long for the league’s backers to zero in on Texas as MLC’s early center of gravity. Several of the most powerful investors were here—not just Ahmed and Jain, but also Ross Perot Jr., who signed on alongside his business partner and has a long history of doing business in India. There was also Ahmed’s complex in Prairie View, which the league decided to use as a training ground and a site for junior tournaments and other player-development projects. And there was the fact that moguls and teams from Seattle and San Francisco could fly to Texas for matches just as easily as those from New York and Washington, D.C. \nBut perhaps most important, when the league set out to find a stadium to host its first matches, it found the perfect site in Grand Prairie, the Dallas suburb sandwiched between Irving and Arlington, just south of Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport. A former independent league baseball stadium built in 2008 for the now-defunct Texas AirHogs, the grounds would require a substantial redesign and renovation, but that would cost half as much as constructing a new stadium. And the league quickly found that building in Texas is a lot easier than in, say, California. “The fact is, we get stuff done in Texas, and the regulators are helpful,” Jain said. “You can come here and within a year or two have all the permitting done and a stadium up and running. It’s so much easier to do business here, and you don’t realize that until you go other places.”  \nOn an early June morning in Grand Prairie, just over a month before the opening day of MLC’s inaugural season, construction workers were preparing to pour concrete to form one of the last remaining sections of the stadium risers to be built, and another crew was repainting the VIP suites upstairs. (The season, which began July 13, will run as a two-week-long tournament, featuring eighteen total matches between six teams.) Out on the field, the central rectangular area—the pitch—was roped off to protect its turf, while sprinklers doused the sand covering the rest of the circular playing field. A shipment of sod would be showing up that afternoon, to be laid down on an eleven-inch-deep bed of highly specific sandy soil approved by the United States Golf Association, the nation’s reigning authority on sand for turf sports.\nDave Agnew, a tousle-haired Aussie who has built cricket pitches all over the world and whom MLC brought to Dallas to work full-time getting this one just right, oversaw the field work, while William Swann, another tall Australian, managed the entire $20 million construction project. Their jobs weren’t easy. Baseball and cricket share some obvious attributes—pitchers, batters, fielders—but the playing fields and surrounding structures are not easily transferable between the two sports. The entire stadium, save for the suites, had to be gutted to make room for the circular field. Where the baseball field had been two and a half acres, the new cricket surface is four. Even so, MLC managed to increase the stadium capacity from about five thousand to seven thousand fans.\nOn top of that, Russia invaded Ukraine a few weeks before work began last spring, and the resulting supply chain snarls slowed down plans from day one. A backup generator the crew ordered last summer had a 54-week lead time, meaning it should arrive just in time for the season. Meanwhile, a rainy spring this year has interrupted work days over and over. When all that expensive soil and sand turns to mud, concrete trucks can’t pass through the pitch to work on the stands for at least a few days. \nBut for all the potential construction snags, one of Swann’s biggest concerns was the relative paucity of luxury amenities and suites. “We have thirteen suites and two clubrooms, and once you go through the list of high–net worth individuals who will be coming, you quickly start to run out of suite space,” he said. Earlier this year, several teams from the Indian Premier League invested in MLC teams, and that introduced a whole new layer of wealth and influence to the mix. The New York MLC team, for instance, became MI New York, a reference to the Mumbai Indians, owned by the Indian oil conglomerate Reliance Industries, whose chairman, Mukesh Ambani, is Asia’s richest man and the world’s richest sports-team owner. The Dallas-based Texas Super Kings became affiliated with the Chennai Super Kings, a club owned by a powerful Indian cement company.\nAside from upgrading the furniture in the suites and updating the concessions to include samosas and roti wraps alongside hot dogs, there’s not much more Swann’s crew can do to accommodate the league’s VIPs.  But the dilemma about adequate luxury space speaks to the size of the opportunity in U.S. cricket. \nOne of the most important areas of the stadium is an expanse of concrete on the concourse level that’s big enough to host sponsor activations—to show off a new car model, say. “You’ve got to pay the bills,” as Swann put it. The more built-in potential there is for sponsors, the more they’ll pay, the more the league can grow, and so on. The six teams competing this year (representing Los Angeles; New York; San Francisco; Seattle; Washington, D.C.; and Texas) will grow to eight at some point in the next few years, if all goes according to plan, with further goals of expansion down the line. Each franchise will ultimately want a home stadium. And once there are world-class cricket stadiums around the country, they can host international events. Already the 2024 T20 World Cup plans to hold some matches in Grand Prairie.\nAs Swann and Agnew talked field specs and growth opportunities, a young Sri Lankan woman who works in digital marketing for the league, Zayanya de Alwis, listened quietly and then interjected that the opportunity goes beyond cricket’s existing fan base. “We want the South Asian community to come out, but we also want to let American kids know about it,” she said. Where she lives, in the Bay Area, the younger generation is already “cricket mad,” she said, especially in the Silicon Valley corridor between San Francisco and San Jose, where practically every high school has a competitive cricket club. Here in North Texas, some public schools in Frisco have similar groups, but others aren’t there yet. As MLC builds out its infrastructure in Texas, de Alwis has started reaching out to more schools and groups such as the Grand Prairie ISD phys ed teachers and the Grand Prairie Police Department, which puts on sports-focused summer camps. \nYouth cricket may represent the future of American cricket, but the sport also needs adult fans now. One of the boldest projects on that front is taking shape about thirty miles north of the stadium, at Grandscape, a sprawling shopping mall and entertainment complex in the Denton County suburb the Colony. Here, just across a sidewalk from an indoor go-karting palace and something called the Puttery (“immersive, adults-only mini golf, craft cocktails, and upscale eats”), the first American location of Sixes Social Cricket, a new kind of sports bar, opened last month. \nInside, a row of electric-orange batting cages and scoreboards flanks a bar and restaurant area. Diners choose from sandwiches such as the Delhi Smasher (chicken with Indian seasonings) and the Sri Lankan Fielder (a veggie burger) while taking turns batting against virtual bowlers (pitchers) who hurl balls from large video screens at the far end of each fenced-in cage. Purple, green, orange, and blue stripes cover every surface of the room, in varying sizes and orientations. “We were going for that Paul Smith look,” the company’s cofounder and CEO, Calum Mackinnon, told me. “But also, we want people to walk in here and go, ‘What’s going on?’ If people don’t do that, we haven’t done a good enough job.” \nOne afternoon a couple weeks before the grand opening, Mackinnon, who previously ran a small chain of Scottish restaurants in the United Kingdom, took a break from final preparations to demonstrate his bar’s game technology. As a Scotsman, he hadn’t grown up with cricket (“It’s really more of an English thing,” he said), but he’d found himself drawn to the growing trend of so-called social-entertainment restaurants—places like the Puttery and Topgolf. After a concept for a whiskey bar with virtual hunting failed to take off because of COVID-19 disruptions, he turned his attention to cricket. “And as soon as we opened this in the UK, the feedback was overwhelming,” Mackinnon said. “We got more than four hundred franchise requests from all over the world in just a year and a half.” With eight locations in the UK up and running and with MLC starting up here, opening in the Dallas suburbs felt like a natural next step. \nIn cricket, the term “six” is the equivalent of a home run in baseball, and the batting cages at Sixes register where players hit the ball and assign scores accordingly. After a couple of whiffs, Mackinnon hit a six. “It’s not like baseball, where the ball’s flying at you a hundred miles an hour,” he said. “People can pick this up relatively quickly, and it’s all about getting points, getting people competitive.” Typically, he said, people get better with a few drinks in them. “My sweet spot is four or five pints. Then it goes remarkably downhill quite fast.”\nHe’s in close contact with MLC, and he said a couple of his batting cages would eventually end up in the Grand Prairie stadium as amenities for fans and marketing vehicles for the restaurant. But ultimately, “we don’t really market to the cricketers,” he said. “The cricketers will find us. There’s such a huge South Asian population around here, they’ll be excited and bring their noncricketing friends, and that will create positive momentum.” He’d seen it work already in the UK: “Eighty percent of the people that come to Sixes there have never played cricket before.”\nBack at Tanweer Ahmed’s Prairie View Cricket Complex, out on Field 5, a sixteen-year-old player named Aarin Nadkarni sprinted from the far edge of the round field toward the center, where a batter stood at one end of a rectangular strip in front of the wicket, a formation of three sticks in the ground with two smaller sticks balanced across the top of them. As he reached the far end of the rectangle, Nadkarni windmilled his outstretched right arm overhead in a violently fast circle and released a leather ball, smaller and harder than a baseball. His whole body pitched forward with his momentum, a mane of wavy black hair bouncing around the edges of his yellow ball cap as he braked to a stop and the batter took a swing. \nIt was the penultimate game of a weekend-long tournament that’s part of the MLC under-seventeen cricket championships, and Aarin’s Houston-based MSCA Hurricanes were facing a squad from New Jersey. In T20 cricket, each team gets one turn at bat and another fielding. The Houston boys batted the first half of this match, scoring a respectable 164 runs, and now it was time to try to hold their opponents to fewer. Aarin, his coach told me from the sideline, is one of the country’s top young fast bowlers (essentially a pitcher with a mean fastball), and the strategy today was to bowl aggressively from the outset to neutralize the opposing team’s top two or three batters early. \nThe Houston coach, Sushil Nadkarni, is also Aarin’s dad. Like Jain and Ahmed, he came to this country as a young man, in his case from the Indian city of Pune in 1999, to pursue a master’s degree at Texas A\u0026M–Kingsville. After grad school, Nadkarni began a career doing environmental-impact management for a multinational consulting firm with clients in the oil and gas industry. He also played competitive cricket. He’d been an elite youth player in India, even making the under-nineteen national team, and he quickly came to dominate the American cricket scene, becoming captain of Team USA and the best batter in the sport’s domestic history, with a practically unfathomable batting average of 51.3 percent. “The next highest was thirty-six,” he offered proudly.\nBetween bites of a taco for lunch in the bleachers, Nadkarni kept one eye on his team as he described how he started Master Strokes Cricket America, the first training academy of its kind in the Houston area, in a Katy strip mall in 2015. Today there are dozens of academies around Texas’s biggest cities, Nadkarni said—“one on every corner” in some areas. At MSCA, players learn batting and bowling skills and work on physical conditioning.\nIt’s the kind of training Nadkarni received in India, and it wasn’t available in this country until recently. On the field, the quality of cricket the boys play here isn’t quite up to the level of equivalent Indian or Pakistani teams, Nadkarni said, but it’s not far off. The difference is not the amount of raw talent here. “It’s the amount of cricket played,” he explained. “In India they’re playing three or four games a week.” It’s just a part of the culture there, in the way that kids play basketball or soccer here.  \nFor now, as cricket remains a niche sport, playing seriously is an expensive proposition for young athletes. Many of the players come from white-collar families. It costs a thousand dollars to attend a good academy for a year, plus another thousand or two in various tournament fees. Then there’s expensive gear to buy and the cost of family trips for travel tournaments. “It’s easily twenty or twenty-five thousand dollars a year,” Nadkarni said—and unlike many other sports, that doesn’t currently come with the potential payoff of a college scholarship. \nFor Aarin Nadkarni, who grew up in a cricket household and watches all the cricket he can on Willow, the start of Major League Cricket holds up the possibility that he could have a bright future in the sport in this country—without having to moonlight, as his dad always did. In addition to youth competitions, MLC also runs a set of minor league teams, and both efforts aim specifically to develop the next generation of pros. While most of the major league players will be foreign nationals, franchises are required to maintain a minimum number of U.S. residents on their rosters, with plans to also maintain dedicated slots for younger players. Aarin hopes to be one of the first to enter that pipeline, though he’s planning to go to college as a backstop. \nA second-generation immigrant in suburban Houston, Aarin is every bit as Texan as he is Indian. He follows football and basketball, but rather than getting pulled away from cricket toward those American pastimes, he has found space for all three in his life, and he sees a similar blending of cultures happening among his peers as cricket becomes increasingly baked into life in the States. “Almost all of our parents are immigrants, and we consider ourselves American,” he said. “But we think cricket is a good sport. It’s just a part of me.” \nAarin’s team lost the game that afternoon in Prairie View—he successfully bowled out two of the most dangerous New Jersey batsmen, but the third got the better of him. “He was the highest run scorer in the tournament and ended up taking the match away from us,” Aarin said later. The Hurricanes lost again the next day playing a team from North Carolina. The Houston boys entered the weekend ranked first of the thirty teams playing and, despite the losses, ended up still in the top four based on the tournament’s scoring system. It was the first of three tournaments that will eventually crown the MLC youth national champions in December. \nAhmed believes playing cricket teaches important values. “You can’t have a gentleman’s game without patience and discipline,” he said. And self-reliance. “Whereas you can hide yourself on a soccer team, you cannot hide here. You will be exposed in a second.” (It also appears that knocking rival sports as lesser pursuits is one of fandom’s universal values.) He sees parallels between success on the pitch and his own bootstrapped fortune, and he worries that immigrant new Texans today lack the same drive. “The people who are coming over here now are different,” he said. “They believe you can pluck dollars off a tree and get rich overnight.” \nIt’s a belief that only furthers his commitment to building out a cricket culture in Houston. And, lately, Ahmed has considered entering politics. Ever since he met former U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo at an event last year, he’s begun spending time in Palm Beach, Florida, with Republican lawmakers and former Trump administration officials, whom he says are recruiting him to run for Congress.\nRegardless of that project, he’s working to make sure one of MLC’s first expansion teams lands in Houston, within the next five years. He’d originally wanted the Texas team there, close to his cricket complex, but the stadium opportunity in Grand Prairie—and Jain’s influence in Dallas and slightly larger ownership stake in the league—proved insurmountable. Between MLC,  hosting next year’s T20 World Cup, and cricket becoming an Olympic sport in 2028, when the games will be held in Los Angeles, Ahmed believes, the U.S. will emerge as one of the premier cricket nations in the world. \nAfter the Hurricanes’ tournament game back in June ended and players started trickling away, Ahmed stopped one of them to chat—a fifteen-year-old named Danyal Bhagani, whose eighteen-year-old brother, Rayaan, plays on the Houston minor league team and is one of the best hopes for a local breakout cricketer, along with Aarin Nadkarni. \n“You see that?” Ahmed said to me after hearing how many runs the boy scored and wishing him good luck and hard work for the next day. “They moved here, he and his brother, two years ago from L.A. because of this.” He gestured around at the dream fields he had built, at the long stretch of highway frontage that functions as free advertising. Players were moving here to train at Sushil’s academy and be close to the country’s best cricket complex. Teams were flying in from the coasts to compete against them. “We can do a lot with this,” he said.  \nA few weeks later, the temperature was 103 in Grand Prairie when Ross Perot Jr. bowled the ceremonial first ball of the first match of Major League Cricket. Outside the sold-out stadium, hundreds of frustrated fans stood in line for more than an hour to pass through a security bottleneck, and a police officer hurried to help someone who’d fainted in the heat. \nInside, past the orange Sixes batting cage and a promo tent from Royal brand rice, league reps handed out giant yellow-and-blue Texas Super Kings flags. By a little after 8 p.m., the lines had finally cleared, and thousands of fans blew yellow plastic whistles in a nod to a Chennai game tradition. After a Texas player hit a six, a roar went up and the flags started to wave in the stands. A pair of drummers beat their way through the concourse. As the crowd settled down, the sound system played “Deep in the Heart of Texas.”\n\nBen Rowen is a senior editor at Texas Monthly for News \u0026 Politics.\n\n\nDan Solomon writes about politics, music, food, sports, criminal justice, health care, film, and business.\n\n\nDan Solomon writes about politics, music, food, sports, criminal justice, health care, film, and business.\n\n\nDan Solomon writes about politics, music, food, sports, criminal justice, health care, film, and business.\n\n\nAlexandra Samuels is a senior editor at Texas Monthly who writes about politics and policy.\n\n\nEmily McCullar is a senior editor covering pop culture, news, and Texas history.

Nadella’s shares of Microsoft were worth about $261 million as of Monday.\nIn late 2022, league officials announced the inaugural season of Major League Cricket after years of delays caused by construction setbacks on the league’s main stadium in Texas, where half the matches were played. The season lasted three weeks and featured six teams playing Twenty20 cricket, a shortened version of the sport. The teams, representing cities and states across the country—New York, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Texas, San Francisco and Los Angeles—played all their matches between two stadiums in Texas and North Carolina. USA Cricket, which has officially sanctioned the league, has said that Major League Cricket is part of its official strategy to turn cricket, which is already incredibly popular in India, Pakistan and Australia, into a mainstream U.S. sport and to become a full member of the International Cricket Council by 2030. It’s not the first effort to create a cricket market in the U.S. though. 2004 saw the first attempt at professional cricket in the U.S. with startup league Pro Cricket. That league folded after just one season. In 2015, a series of exhibition matches were hosted across the U.S. by legendary Australian and Indian cricketers Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar. Meanwhile, this new league comes ahead of the 2024 Twenty20 World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the U.S. and the West Indies. Outside of the United States, cricket is a massively popular—and lucrative—sport: Five-year broadcasting rights to the Indian Premier League sold for $6.2 billion last year, a higher per-game value than any other sports league aside from the NFL.\nNita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani and the face of the family’s cricket enterprises, brought a whole couch to the stadium to watch Sunday’s match in comfort, ESPN journalist Peter Della Penna reported.\n\"Just look at the atmosphere here,” Nita Ambani told reporters. “It looks like a festival of cricket.

This is such a grand event. There was an unbelievable atmosphere and I want to thank each and every individual who has come out here,” he said.\nSuper Kings batsman David Miller, who was awarded Player of the Match for his hard-hitting 61 from 42 balls, including four sixes, was also impressed.\n“It’s fantastic to see such a great turnout and the facilities have been fantastic. I think there have been a few guys, kind of questioned around what it was going to be like but it shot the lights out here,” said the South African, one of a number of players with a background in the world’s top Twenty20 competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nMLC has backing from four IPL franchises including the Mumbai Indians, whose New York team began play on Friday.\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia’s Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns, and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

[+] via Getty Images)\nPooran unleashed brute force with a slew of big hits into a raucous crowd, the type of spectacle that best encapsulates cricket's whirlwind of a format hoping to attract a new audience in the world's biggest sports market.\nSince being unveiled late last decade, there has been a lot of hope over MLC - America's first pro T20 cricket league after several failed attempts previously.\nWith healthy investment, over $100 million has been raised including from some of cricket's most influential figures, MLC has been able to attract stars from powerhouse nations to lend credibility to the tournament and ensure its standard sufficed.\nAttendances were respectable with around 70,000 fans turning out to the 18-day tournament played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the more modest Church Street Park in Morrisville.\nThe tournament will undoubtedly benefit when all six teams - the others comprising Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas and Washington DC in targeted areas with large Indian expatriate communities - can play on their home grounds and build a proper following.\nBut that's likely still at least a few years away given the significant infrastructure needed for cricket played on bigger grounds than baseball and requiring a pitch in the middle.\nThe tournament was always initially aimed at the expatriates although the broadcast - beamed to 87 countries worldwide - attempted to Americanize it with presenters wearing Texan cowboy hats while the commentators occasionally seemed to dial it up vocally much like in the overbearing style prevalent in American sports.\nFans have flocked to Major League Cricket (AP Photo/LM Otero)\nIt appears MLC - and cricket broadly - will be more of a niche sport, serving the large South Asian expats well but there is hope that it could lure others, possibly those who may have grown out of baseball which doesn't enjoy the same relevance it once did.\nIt's the start of a crucial period for cricket in the U.S. - a targeted growth area by the sport's governing body leading to resentment from some other countries - with the T20 World Cup next year to be played partly in America.\nWhile optimism surrounds cricket's bid for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\nBut there have been teething problems with some games played in oppressive heat of over 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), while the standard of the local cricketers was certainly a notable peg below the international players.\nHomegrown heroes will need to be eventually developed for cricket to have any chance of cracking the congested American sports public.\nAnd familiar tumult is always hovering in the volatile American cricket landscape, with the tournament only officially sanctioned in April - as I first reported.\nBut the launch of MLC was an undoubted important step for this long lusted sports market and something to clearly build on.\nAs Pooran was mobbed by his teammates, in the first scenes of championship glory in this tournament, cricket had finally made a dent in its American pursuit but there is plenty of work to do.\n"

What does that look like?\"\nPlunkett's last international game proved his career highpoint having helped England to a momentous World Cup triumph on home soil in mid-2019.\nLiam Plunkett was part of England's 2019 World Cup triumph (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\nBut it ended on a bitter note as England sought to focus on younger bowlers, with Plunkett blindsided by management's shift in direction as he suddenly found himself pondering his future.\n\"Do I stay in County cricket (in the UK) or go into coaching or mentorship?\" he thought at the time.\nFortunately, Major League Cricket - a pro T20 franchise league hoped to spur the unfulfilled potential of cricket in the world's biggest sports market - came calling and after numerous setbacks will finally launch on July 13.\nThe league's hierarchy has sought particular expertise from veteran players with an American link.\n\"I got a phone call from MLC and they said 'listen, we understand your wife's here. Do you want to come on board with Major League Cricket?',\" said Plunkett, who jumped at the opportunity and in 2021 made the move to his new home of Pennsylvania.\nPlunkett has been tasked with helping set up MLC and making it \"more professional\", while running cricket academies in Philadelphia.\n\"You have kids here in America, under 11s and 13s, who are as good as anywhere in the world,\" he said.\n\"The drop off comes at 15 because there hadn't really been that next next pathway here. There's no real sustainable revenue to make a career out of it.\n\"We are hoping academies will provide a pipeline for those who are still developing their skills to have more high performance training.\n\"Hopefully MLC can show that it's possible to make a living through cricket.\"\nPlunkett will be one of the headline players for San Francisco Unicorns, led by former Australia captain Aaron Finch, but the tournament's ultimate success could hinge on emerging national cricketers.\nAustralia captain Aaron Finch led Australia to the T20 World Cup title (Photo by Gareth ... [+] Copley-ICC/ICC via Getty Images)\nSpinning all-rounder Sanjay Krishnamurthi will be Plunkett's teammate at the Unicorns with the 20-year-old having already played international cricket for the U.S.\nArizona-raised Krishnamurthi developed an affinity with cricket from his India-born father, but truly fell in love with the sport when India memorably won the 2011 World Cup on home soil.\nJust a few months later, Krishnamurthi and his parents moved to India where his skills developed quickly amid specialist training and intense competition.\n\"There are so many players at a high level in India, whereas in the U.S. we have a few really good players but it drops off,\" he told me in an interview.\nKrishnamurthi returned to the U.S. seeking greater playing opportunities and represents the type of emerging talent hoped to capture the imagination of local fans.\n\"If I can help a few kids pick up the game and fall in love with it like I did...that would be exciting,\" he said.\nRealizing that American cricket needs homegrown heroes, like Krishnamurthi, Plunkett has resisted the temptation to play in next year's T20 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S.\n\"That was never really my ambition to play,\" he said. \"I feel like players who are younger or who grafted hard deserve to play. U.S. cricket will get better with these youngsters being exposed to professional cricket.\"\nPlunkett, however, will soon be lining up for Unicorns in MLC's opening season as they build a brand from scratch in a world famous sports city.\nVisibility will be tough initially with the Unicorns still in the midst of developing a cricket stadium in Santa Clara. The inaugural MLC season will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\"It will be tricky in the first couple of years for the whole league until every franchise has their stadium,\" he said. \"But there's a lot of cricket that is played in San Francisco, so there is a cricket base.\n\"We will need to hit the right market to help it grow. It would be good to get some big athletes involved like Kevin Durant investing in the Philadelphia Union in Major League Soccer.\"\nEven before launching, MLC has caused a stir with the tournament to be played in peak summer, a quieter period in the congested American sports scene but clashing with England's cricket season.\nThe well-heeled tournament - already boasting funding of over $100 million - has lured opener Jason Roy, who cancelled his England deal to sign a larger contract with MLC.\nEngland batter Jason Roy will play in Major League Cricket (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images)\nPlunkett has suddenly found himself torn in the middle, having experienced the exhilaration and pride of representing England across formats, but now resembling a recruiter.\n\"People (England cricketers) do reach out to me. I still speak to a lot of the guys. It's piqued the interest that's for sure,\" he said.\n\"They want to know how it (MLC) is going. Hopefully there are opportunities for guys to get across and that it can coexist with the England season.\"\nIn similar sentiment expressed by MLC's hierarchy, which they hope is a notable point of difference to other leagues, Plunkett believed the glamorous American sports market can lure those reluctant to go on the T20 franchise merry-go-round.\n\"It's very exciting for players,\" he said. \"Sports is so big in America, that if we can crack the market then there are other opportunities for players to network and open up streams of revenue in terms of commercially and sponsorship.\"\nPressure is on for MLC, which will finally be unleashed after Covid-19 delays and well-worn tumult within American cricket, but there is confidence from within that it can become a harbinger for the sport in coveted terrain.\n\"I want people tuning in from the U.K. and Australia to recognize an amazing product, but it feels American as well,\" Plunkett said.\n\"If I can be one of the people who spearheaded this and made it grow then that will be a pretty amazing legacy.\"\n"

  "body": "When Major League Cricket’s first game gets under way today (July 13) at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas, it will, on paper, be a battle between the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders. \nSeasoned cricket watchers will know better, though. They’ll be able to see it as a continuation of the contest between Chennai and Kolkata, two Indian cities that field similarly named franchises in the 15-year-old Indian Premier League (IPL). The Chennai Super Kings won the 2023 edition of the IPL. \nTwo other teams out of the six in the US league are owned by IPL franchises as well: the Seattle Orcas, an offshoot of the Delhi Capitals; and the awkwardly named Mumbai Indians New York, sprung from the Mumbai Indians. Many of the players in these teams are imports as well: globetrotting freelancers who have already plied their trade in the IPL. \nTo rope the wealthy US market into world cricket has been something of a dream for cricketing authorities for decades. But the sport has suffered from the reputation that its rules are byzantine and its matches epically long—the longest version of it, after all, lasts five days. A game of T20 cricket, though, of the kind seen in the IPL and the MLC, operates along simpler rules and is roughly as long as the average baseball game. If there’s any kind of cricket that will lure Americans, T20 is likely to be it. \nBut MLC still feels like a transplant, not least because of where its players and team owners come from. More specifically, it feels like a tentacular expansion of the IPL, the world’s most lucrative sports championship after the National Football League. \nSince India’s national stars turn out in international fixtures for most of the year, the IPL only lasts two months. To keep the money rolling in, the owners of IPL teams—a Chennai-based cement giant, for example, or Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance conglomerate—started buying franchises overseas. All six teams in South Africa’s SA20 league are spinoffs of IPL teams, as are three out of the six teams in the United Arab Emirates’ International League. \nThe MLC still has a few distinctly American elements. It functions as the big brother to Minor League Cricket, in which 26 teams are owned by local individuals or companies. The investors in the $120 million MLC include Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft and a noted cricket nut; Ross Perot Jr.; and several people of South Asian descent who have founded companies in the US. \nBut with the teams themselves largely being brand extensions from the IPL, the temptation is strong to regard the MLC as a feeder league—its teams funded by the geysers of money from the Indian tournament, and run only to augment the glory of the franchises back home. Right from the coin toss in the Texas-LA game, the MLC will be a satellite to its mother ship in India—a dubious way to popularize a sport in a new market. \nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.\n"

A cricket complex outside Houston hosts youth and professional players alike, reflecting the sport’s growing popularity in a changing city.\nBy J. David Goodman\nPhotographs by Meridith Kohut\nJ. David Goodman and Meridith Kohut watched cricket in Prairie View, Texas, and attended the first Major League Cricket draft in Houston.\nDrive northwest out of Houston, and as cow pastures wrestle back the flat expanse from the city’s tentacled sprawl, there arise along the road, suddenly, improbably, many, many cricket fields.\nHead south to find a small cricket stadium nestled in the suburbs, or west to find fields sprouting in county parks.\nThe game of cricket — a bat-ball-and-wicket contest of patience and athleticism that was born in Britain and is barely understood by most Americans — has surprisingly taken hold in the land of Friday night football. A surging population of South Asian immigrants around Houston and Dallas imported their favorite sport to their adopted home, where it has grown amid a Lone Star culture of competition in all things, especially sports.\nCricket’s swift rise in Houston has attracted international attention and helped make Texas the launching pad for the sport’s first American professional league, Major League Cricket, whose inaugural season began on Thursday outside Dallas.\n“One of the unknown things about Houston is the diversity of the population from many cricket-playing countries,” said Tim Cork, a deputy consul general at the British consulate in Houston. “There are Indians, Pakistanis, there’s obviously a huge number of Brits here, Australian accents wherever you go.”\nThe number of people of Indian heritage in Texas has doubled over the last decade to a half a million, according to estimates from the Census Bureau’s annual survey, including 73,000 in Harris County, which includes Houston, and 64,000 in suburban Fort Bend County.\n“When I came to this country, the only sport I knew was cricket,” said KP George, the county judge in Fort Bend, who immigrated to the U.S. from India in 1993. When he was elected in 2018, none of the county parks had a cricket field, he said. Now there are seven, and each is reserved for play months in advance.\n“There’s a huge demand,” he said. “We’re working on a couple more fields.”\nThe pace of the sport’s development in Houston has surprised even those who have been working to make it happen.\nHouston played host to a player draft for the new professional league in March at the Johnson Space Center, one of the biggest tourist sites in the city. In the fields to the northwest of Houston, the league’s newly minted teams came together this month for training camps.\n“We always thought we would be building it slowly,” said Mangesh Chaudhari, 38, an owner of the Prairie View Cricket Complex who, starting in 2018, oversaw the task of flattening a swath of farmland about 50 miles northwest of the city into six oval cricket fields. “Suddenly, cricket picked up.”\nThe location, along a major highway in Prairie View, Texas, offered both the right kind of clay soil for the grass pitch where cricketers bowl and bat, and free advertising to passing cars on U.S. Route 290.\nThe project, conceived and funded by a Houston businessman, Tanweer Ahmed, was a Field-of-Dreams gamble that if they built it, people would come. It worked better and faster than they had anticipated, Mr. Chaudhari said, adding that the complex was still a work in progress. For example, there are still no lights or permanent restrooms.\nOne weekday in June, dozens of cars streamed into the cricket complex. Young players arrived from Atlanta and Dallas for a youth tournament, lugging large bags of bats and pads in the gathering heat.\n“Good luck, boys! Good luck! Play hard!” Golam Nowsher, 61, yelled to his teenage players from the Houston area as they took the field.\nMr. Nowsher immigrated from Bangladesh, where he had been a star player, and has been coaching young cricketers around Houston. He watched as his team batted at the start of what would be a roughly five-hour match, bantering about cricket and careers with the players, who huddled on bleachers under a small square of shade.\n“Who are the guys going to study A.I.?” he asked.\n“I’m studying computer science,” one player said.\n“I thought you were going to be a doctor?” Mr. Nowsher replied.\nAs the 17-year-old captain of the team, Arya Kannantha, waited for his turn to bat, he said he had been thinking about college, and also about trying to make a U.S. national team. Despite the growth of cricket around Houston, few of his classmates in suburban Katy — home to one of the largest and most expensive high school football stadiums in the country — were familiar with cricket.\n“Not many people at my school play it,” Arya said. He added, laughing: “They just think it’s baseball, but weird.”\nFar from a curiosity, cricket is a passion in Texas’s booming South Asian community and is poised to become a big business, drawing major local investors including Ross Perot Jr., the businessman and son of the former independent presidential candidate. Mr. Perot, along with his business partner, Anurag Jain, is an owner of the local major league team, the Texas Super Kings.\nMr. Perot said he recently discussed cricket with Gov. Greg Abbott during a visit by the former British prime minister, Boris Johnson. “I said, ‘Mr. Prime Minister, I want you to know, we’re bringing cricket to this state,’” Mr. Perot said. “He was shocked, and he loved it.”\nMr. Jain, who grew up playing cricket in Chennai, India, and now lives in Dallas, encouraged investment in the nascent U.S. professional league, citing the sport’s huge international following and the large fan base in Texas. “They will tell you food is a way to a man’s heart,” Mr. Jain said. “Cricket is the way to a South Asian’s heart. It’s more than a sport, it’s a way of life.”\nThe arrival of cricket has given hope to some leaders in Prairie View, home to the historically Black state university, Prairie View A\u0026M, that the tournaments will become a revenue stream for the cash-strapped town, even though it has few cricket aficionados or South Asian residents.\n“Our stance is to help them out, help them grow,” said Kendric Jones, a county commissioner and graduate of the university. “It’s a tourist attraction.”\nOn an evening in March, hundreds of people gathered at the Johnson Space Center for the player draft for Major League Cricket.\nInside, under suspended satellites and astronaut suits, cricket fans and investors in the league’s six inaugural teams — based in New York, Seattle, Washington, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Texas — mingled with the young prospective players.\nHarmeet Singh, who grew up playing in Mumbai and was picked first overall in the draft, recently moved from Seattle to a large house in the Houston suburb of Katy.\n“Weather-wise, I can play more here,” Mr. Singh, 30, said, standing with his wife and 2-year-old daughter. “It was an upgrade — we were in an apartment in Seattle for the same price.”\nStanding at the back of the museum hall, by a large space capsule and a table of small hamburgers, were many of the people who helped develop the sport in Houston, including Yogesh Patel, 75, who began a cricket club after arriving in the city nearly five decades ago.\n“It feels like what I dreamt in 1976 has come true,” he said, looking around. “Houston has become a capital of cricket in the U.S.A.”\nJ.

  "body": "Players such as Mitch Marsh, Quinton de Kock and Liam Plunkett are bringing their experience to a notoriously tough market\nIt was an obvious place to launch a sporting moonshot – a cricket league that can survive and thrive in America.\nLast week, Space Center Houston hosted a reveal of next-generation spacesuits for a lunar mission. A few days later its main hall was crowded with cricketers wearing gaudy baseball caps in the colours of their new teams as the latest attempt to bring professional cricket to the US held its domestic player draft.\nWith the first overall pick, the Seattle Orcas of Major League Cricket (MLC) selected an all-rounder: 30-year-old Harmeet Singh, captain of the minor-league Seattle Thunderbolts and a member of the India squad that won the 2012 under-19 World Cup.\nFour years after taking three wickets for England in their World Cup final win over New Zealand, Liam Plunkett will bowl for the San Francisco Unicorns. A domestic player because he lives in the Philadelphia area with his American wife, the 37-year-old was chosen in the second round.\nBeaming in a suit jacket, white trainers and an orange Unicorns cap, Plunkett posed for the cameras next to the Mission Mars exhibit, a bulbous silvery spacecraft dangling from the ceiling above his head as pop music and a variegated array of glowing lights lent the event a novel atmosphere: sports meets disco meets STEM.\nNot quite the Long Room at Lord’s. But the inaugural MLC season will boast international talent worthy of the sport’s most hallowed venues. Among Plunkett’s fellow Unicorns are the former New Zealand all-rounder, Corey Anderson, the former Australia limited overs captain, Aaron Finch, and his 2021 Men’s T20 World Cup-winning teammate, Marcus Stoinis.\nAnother Australian, the in-form Mitch Marsh, will play for Seattle, as will the 30-year-old former South Africa captain, Quinton de Kock. Wanindu Hasaranga, a 25-year-old Sri Lankan international, and the South African fast bowler, Anrich Nortje, have signed for the Washington Freedom. More well-known overseas names are set to be announced in the coming days to line up alongside the 54 US-based players drafted on Sunday.\nSheila Jackson Lee, a boosterish Houston congresswoman, opened the ceremony. “Are we ready for cricket?” she inquired. “Are we ready?”\nIt’s an open question. American cricket has long been tramelled by turbulent governance and earlier attempts at professional leagues struggled to get off the launch pad. But there are strong reasons for optimism, not least the wealth and experience of the MLC investors.\nAn initial $120m is funding the project, which has some influential backers from the technology and media sectors and India, including Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, who is part of the Seattle ownership group. Owners of Indian Premier League (IPL) clubs have stakes in four of the six MLC teams.\nThe season will take the T20 format and will be played from 13-30 July – helpful timing to attract stars during the southern hemisphere offseason, though problematic for players in England. Joining the Orcas, Freedom and Unicorns are the Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York and the Texas Super Kings. The locations are strategic: cities with large South Asian communities that offer ready-made fanbases, with organisers recognising that it will take years to attract significant numbers of spectators who have never played or watched cricket.\n“We’re trying to build infrastructure, a minor league, a major league, get the national team competitive all at the same time. There’s an awful lot going on and it’s going to take time, but I think our growth trajectory can be quick once … people see, hey this is a great product, this is going to work. I think we’ll then get a second influx of momentum,” said Justin Geale, the MLC tournament director.\nMLC has spent years building a developmental framework to nourish domestic players and improved grounds and training facilities are springing up. The pre-draft combine took place at a six-field complex near Houston that opened in 2019.\nPlunkett is convinced there is latent talent in the US. “I [visited] maybe 13 years ago and I always thought to myself I had one of the better arms in cricket in England, and I just went to the local park in Philadelphia with a few of my friends at college or who worked in Home Depot, and I think all four of them had a better arm than me,” he grinned.\nSign up to The Spin\nSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe US will host the 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup, jointly with the West Indies, though Plunkett denied he is chasing a spot on the American roster next year. “I’m happy finishing international cricket with England at the World Cup,” he said.\nMLC has the financial heft to offer salaries comparable with competitions such as Australia’s Big Bash, England’s and Wales’s The Hundred and the ILT20 in the United Arab Emirates – the salary cap per team is understood to be slightly above $1.1m. “We can get the best players in the world,” said Geale, a former IPL director of operations. “We can put out a world-class product from day one.”\nRusty Theron, a former South Africa international who played for Sussex in 2012, moved to the US in 2015. The 37-year-old was drafted by the new Texas team after playing minor league cricket in the San Francisco Bay area. “We’ve got a pathway set up where if you’re a good player we’ve got eyeballs on you, somewhere you can actually make a living as a cricketer, and something to aspire to,” he said. “As far as professionals go there’s no shortage of people that are interested. After all, it’s the USA and that in itself is a brand, something that sells itself quite easily.”\nSan Francisco have joined forces with Cricket Victoria while Washington have partnered with Cricket New South Wales, tapping into the Australian association’s expertise in coaching and operations while giving it a foothold in America. “We’re moving with the cricket landscape, really,” said Michael Klinger, head of male elite cricket at Cricket NSW. “Cricket’s changing around the world, the T20 franchise leagues are popping up and this is one that could be very big in this market and we want to be part of it.”\nHowever, all the matches are expected to be staged in North Carolina and the Dallas area, where MLC has spent $19m refashioning the erstwhile abode of the defunct Texas AirHogs minor league baseball team into a 7,200-capacity cricket ground. That points to perhaps the league’s biggest challenge: the dearth of suitable venues.\n“We need to get to a home and away model, so they need somewhere to play in their home cities,” Geale said. “In two to three years we’d like to see some serious traction and have a lot of those facilities in place.” That is a tall order given the difficulties of building new stadiums in crowded and expensive cities. Intriguingly, the Freedom and George Mason University are shaping plans for a hybrid cricket/baseball field on the outskirts of Washington.\nStill, as John F Kennedy once said at a football stadium in Houston: We do these things “not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Plunkett is hopeful. “I’ve been here for 15 months now,” he said. “It’s just got more professional and has built momentum. It feels like I’m actually playing professional cricket.”"

  "body": "Like billions of sports fans globally, so many of my favorite childhood memories involve cricket. While I was born in Canada, I grew up in India, where my father was completing a doctorate. In India, cricket is life. My father and I were enormous fans of the game. There’s nothing quite like watching a match live–the sound of the bat making contact with the ball and the ball just grazing the wicket. We loved to talk about our favorite moments and argue over our favorite players. It was an opportunity to share time and space not only with the team and the sport we love but also with each other; to connect over our shared passion for this beloved pastime.\nWhen my father got a job teaching in the United States, we left India behind, and cricket along with it. When I was completing my high school education in Alabama, and going to college at Auburn University, I could no longer watch the matches being played back in India, and there was no easy way to follow the ups and downs of the season. On the odd occasion, we would gather together a group of fans–usually South Asian and British expats–and take over a local baseball field to play some pickup cricket. But for the most part, we had no way to stay connected to cricket. It’s the world’s second most popular sport–but in the United States, it was still unknown.\nIn the time since then, the sports world has undergone many changes. The professionalization of the business of sports has transformed sports leagues and teams. They are now complex businesses with multiple revenue streams, from live entertainment and intellectual property to hospitality, catering, fashion, and real estate. More and more teams are part of a diversified portfolio of assets, with media rights, technology, IP, real estate holdings, and large operating teams focused on optimizing profitability.\nThe relentless pursuit of financial optimization has brought with it a range of new ways for fans to view and connect with the teams they love. Along with advances in technology, this new approach has opened up avenues like streaming, betting, and fantasy, providing paths for fans to engage with their favorite sports and players on a local and global level. Today, an Indian-American family living in Alabama can stream highlights and full matches being played by the best Indian cricket teams, no matter where they are competing.\nYet even as these changes have broadened access for casual and devoted fans alike, taken to their extreme, they risk eroding the passion that drives the unique relationship between teams and fans. When fans are seen as customers, rather than passionate supporters, we lose some of the purity of sport. And when teams are managed like high-performing financial assets, the fan experience becomes similar across teams and leagues, eliminating some of the quirks and idiosyncrasies that used to make fandoms across regions unique. With a more professionalized experience comes a sense of distance; even with more opportunities for access, fans are held at a certain remove.\nThat’s why, when the opportunity arose to launch a new professional cricket league in the United States, I jumped at the chance. Here was an opportunity to share a sport that I loved with others who love it–to provide the kind of personal experience that increasingly is missing from other professional sports. Out of this idea came Major League Cricket­–a new franchise league in the United States. Currently comprising six teams, with squads from Texas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle joining the Washington Freedom (the team I own, based in Washington, DC), the league’s 2023 season will feature 19 matches played over 18 days, building up to the first-ever MLC championship final on Jul. 30, 2023. As many teams have a connection to franchises in the India Premier League, we have structured the season so that matches will take place during Indian cricket’s regular off-season. What’s more, we can offer streaming opportunities that provide additional access to fans without cheapening their experience.\nOne of the elements that make this new venture unique is the owners. From Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan to Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, the owners have the same kind of connection to the sport that I do–one built on a history of true fandom and a desire to share their excitement with others.\nThere is no doubt that our sport will grow and change as time goes on. Make no mistake, I and others who have invested in this new league see an opportunity to grow cricket in the United States both as a passion project and as a business. But we are determined never to lose the purity and the fandom of sports–and to safeguard the experience that is so important to us all.\nSanjay Govil is the chairman of the board at Infinite Computer Solutions and owner of the Washington Freedom.\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\n© 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

  "body": "DC’s newest professional sports team, the Washington Freedom, will make its Major League Cricket debut on Friday with a match against Seattle in Texas.\n\nThe first pro cricket league in the US, MLC has four other teams—Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco—and will play its 2023 season matches at Dallas’ home stadium and at a cricket ground in North Carolina. By 2025, however, the Freedom hope to play home matches in the area at a dual-use baseball/cricket stadium built in partnership with George Mason University.\nCricket is estimated to be the second-most popular sport in the world behind soccer, but its appeal is concentrated in South Asia, the Caribbean, South Africa, and Oceania. In the US, the Freedom and MLC initially will be counting on fan interest from South Asian and West Indian immigrant communities that already have flourishing amateur leagues—but future growth will come from building a broader base of support.\nTo better understand how the Freedom came to be—and where American cricket is heading—Washingtonian spoke with team owner Sanjay Govil, an IT executive from Rockville and lifelong cricket enthusiast:\nI was born in Canada, where my father was doing his doctorate, and then we moved back to India.. I grew up playing cricket, like any other Indian. If the total population of India is 1.4 billion, I would say 1.4 billion people either play or follow cricket. So it’s like a religion there, it’s in everybody’s blood, and it’s a national pastime.\nI moved to Alabama in my senior year of high school and went to Auburn University. I used to play in Auburn, but obviously there was no mechanism at that time to watch matches. So there was a void for a few years when there was no cricket for me. Then I moved to upstate New York to work for IBM. I did my master’s at Syracuse again and played for the Syracuse cricket team. At that time there was no real league, so we had created our own league in upstate New York. Our captain was Raj Subramaniam, who is now the CEO of FedEx— I just met him again at the Biden state dinner with Prime Minister Modi. I moved to Maryland in ‘91 and have called that my home since then. \nWe have so many leagues in every county: Loudoun County, Fairfax County, Montgomery County, Howard County, PG County, and Baltimore County. We have fields all over. We have our Infinite Eagles team, which plays the Maryland Cricket Premier League, and we are the most successful in terms of winning championships. So I’m very proud of that. I’m a U.S. citizen, proud to be an American, but at the same time, my love for cricket has always been there.\nPeople like us, as we’ve grown, our children have grown, and the amount of kids who are playing cricket now at different academies across the United States is mind boggling. We have parents who literally take their kids at 7 AM and come back at 4 PM for cricket. There’s so much money in cricket now, just like soccer, just like the NFL and so on, that they see this as an avenue where people can play in leagues across the world from the Indian Premier League to Major League Cricket in America, and the Big Bash in Australia. So that’s going to be huge.\nMy goal is to make this an American sport. The goal here is not just South Asians, they’re already in it, right? So a lot of my effort is going to being an evangelist for this sport among people who are not exposed to cricket. The good news is that they are already being exposed to cricket because, you know, ESPN occasionally has scores. The second thing that’s a very interesting fact is that cricket used to be played in the US until the 1800s. \nBut the goal is definitely to evangelize the sport in the US. We’ll start to create a lot of social media stuff on how cricket is played, just to bring awareness. We fully understand this is going to be a multi-year cycle. The beauty about this is that this is a three-hour game and you go there and just bang, bang, bang. It is run after run after run, and you go there and have beer, burgers and hot dogs and you know, all the stuff we love here. So it’s a combination of being at a party and enjoying a game. \nI think it’s as fast-paced as the NFL and the NBA, and there is no comparison between baseball and cricket in terms of pace. I mean, it’s nonstop action. The only time there’s no action is when the bowler is coming in to bowl, but there’s action even then, because there’s so much anticipation. And every ball counts. So it’s a very intense game, very fast paced, and you really get into it when you’re supporting your team. \nLet Freedom Ring 🔔 🇺🇸 🏏\n\nJoin us in officially welcoming the Washington Freedom to #MajorLeagueCricket 🥰 @WSHFreedom will give the nation’s capital a professional cricket team of its own for the first time.\nIt’s absolutely monumental 🏛️ ➡️ https://t.co/PSV7Pf4Z5h pic.twitter.com/HpAqbVVTUf\n\n— Major League Cricket (@MLCricket) March 15, 2023\n\n\nThe goal is to have your stadiums up and running as soon as possible. Our goal is 2025, and as every city has its own stadium, we’re obviously going to have matches in each stadium. So the limiting factor is the lack of infrastructure right now. We’re very fortunate that we teamed up with George Mason University to build a stadium, which is going to be a combo of baseball and a cricket field, the first in the United States of America, and it’s going to be a great blueprint for all universities and colleges. And next to us—I cannot name the team—but there’s going to be another professional team coming next to us. They’re building their stadium there, and the concept is to build a whole township in that area. This is being built in the West campus [in Fairfax] because they have like 130 acres of land. So it’s going to be a great thing for the community and a great thing for Washington. The [T20] World Cup is slated to be hosted by a combination of the United States and West Indies next year. It’s already announced. That’s another big impetus for cricket. And then the Olympics 2028 is looking at adding cricket. If that happens, then it’s going to be a full court press on improving cricket in America. "

  "body": "The dream is in place, the field has been built. Major League Cricket finally launches on Thursday outside Dallas. But will the people come? \nFor decades, cricket’s powers have dreamed of making it big in America. Starting on Thursday the grandest, richest attempt yet to get Americans hooked on cricket will begin in a converted baseball stadium (capacity: 7,200) on the outskirts of Dallas. Major League Cricket, as the new competition is known, has money: close to $50m already spent, with another $130m on the way. It has wealthy patrons: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella leads a roll call of leading Indian-American tech executives who’ve signed up to throw cash at the new venture. It has the blessing of an International Cricket Council desperate to lift its sport’s profile in America ahead of the 2024 T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies. It has powerful allies: four Indian Premier League franchises and two state cricket bodies from Australia have signed on as either full owners or operational partners for the fledgling league’s six founding teams. It has a slot in the international cricket calendar that’s relatively uncrowded, with only the men’s and women’s Ashes as real competition for the committed global cricket fan’s attention. It has a list of team names that combine, in delightfully unbound American style, the patriotic (Washington Freedom) and ecological (Seattle Orcas) with the borrowed-from-the-IPL nonsensical (MI New York).\nMost importantly it has players, and some extremely capable ones at that: sprinkled among the little-known local talents (Corne Dry, anyone?) the new competition features the genuine stardust of Wanindu Hasaranga, Kagiso Rabada, Tim David and Anrich Nortje, among many other established T20 internationals who’ve made the trek out to the suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex to help launch cricket’s latest big shot at success in America. But will Major League Cricket have any viewers? Will the American public thrill to the spectacle of a beefy heave through midwicket from Aaron Finch? Will it learn to lament, as millions of cricket fans throughout the world already do, the lost opportunities of a wasted PowerPlay? Will it grow to appreciate the finer points of an Adam Zampa strangler down leg side, or a topless cameo from Faf du Plessis on the player balcony? The final touches – the marking of the boundary barrier, the laying of the turf wicket, the engineering of the outfield – have just been applied to convert the former home ground of now-defunct off-brand baseball side the Texas AirHogs into an international-grade cricket venue. The dream is in place, the field has been built. But will they come?\nThe history of the flatter-batted of the bat and ball sports in the United States provides some basis for caution. Vying with baseball for local supremacy in the late 19th century, cricket enjoyed a brief American “golden age” thanks to the exertions of the Philadelphia Cricket Club, once seen as the equal of the best international teams. But Britain’s late-imperial insecurity saw the US frozen out of international competition, and American cricket went into a rapid and seemingly irreversible decline in the years following the first world war. Since the turn of this century there have been several failed attempts to launch a professional domestic cricket league: Pro Cricket, a prototype of T20 cricket, played a single season in 2004 before folding, while the original ‘Major League Cricket’, launched in 2005 with the patronage of West Indian greats Clive Lloyd and Desmond Haynes, quickly fizzled into insignificance. Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar hosted a series of exhibition matches across the US in 2015 that got expats and immigrants of South Asian, Caribbean and Australian backgrounds excited but no one else. How many times can a sport this old to America be rebranded as something exotic and new? Compounding the inauspiciousness of this history are the troubles facing USA Cricket. The administration and finances of cricket’s governing body in America are a mess, continuing a long history of mismanagement of the sport in this country; the previous governing body was expelled by the ICC in 2017. USA Cricket will have no permanent CEO in place when Major League Cricket launches on Thursday night.\nMLC’s organizers recognize that the road ahead presents some obstacles: “We are somewhat concerned by and appreciative of USA Cricket’s struggles,” says Sameer Mehta, one of the league’s co-CEOs. But he and his fellow founder, Vijay Srinivasan, are thinking big. Mehta and Srinivasan launched Willow TV, the primary streaming app for cricket in the US, in the early 2000s, before selling it to The Times Group, India’s biggest media conglomerate, in 2016. With the money and connections from that sale they have created Major League Cricket, and they believe the time is finally right for America to fully embrace the flat-batted sport. Partly this is because of the recent “cosmopolitan turn” among American sports fans, who are now just as likely to tune in to the late laps from Monza (the Drive to Survive effect, let’s call it) or Brentford v West Ham as they are to enjoy local pro sports. Mostly, though, it’s a function of the growing economic clout and cultural self-confidence of America’s Indian population – almost five million strong, fantastically wealthy (at $140,000, Indian Americans have the highest per capita household wealth of any ethnic group in the US), and growing rapidly thanks to Silicon Valley’s inexhaustible thirst for South Asian tech talent. “It’s insane how successful this community has become so quickly in the last couple of decades,” says Mehta. “But they haven’t brought their culture with them. It’s only very recently that they are flexing their muscles.” Major League Cricket looms as the Indian American community’s next big flex.\nCan a sport with serious financial backing and an existing fan base among America’s ex-Commonwealth migrant population strike gold in the land of the free? Can the transmitted enthusiasm of the Australian flat white makers of Brooklyn help unleash cricket fever across all 50 states? At times it can feel difficult to imagine how this experiment might succeed. Talking to Americans about cricket is usually about as easy as explaining climate change to a ferret. But for MLC, a template of sorts exists. From its “anchor” fan base among the country’s Hispanic migrant population, Major League Soccer has expanded at such a rate over the past two decades that the round ball game now outranks hockey on most metrics as America’s fourth most popular sport. Cricket is arguably a tougher sell to the American public than soccer: it’s played by fewer countries at elite level, and the sport’s global profusion of formats and competitions means cricket lacks some of the clarity of football’s cultural hierarchy, under which Europe’s top domestic leagues are unanimously considered the pinnacle of competition. But if any “foreign” sport is going to break through and make it in America, why not this one?\nMLC’s backers think they have the goods to win over the American heartland. Mehta insists the league is not a play to win Indian viewership but a direct gamble on the sport’s potential appeal to Americans; each of the founding franchises has committed to building a stadium in its home city so the league can evolve as a proper home-and-away competition in the years to come. The league is making all the right noises about professional “pathways” for domestic cricketers, developing local talent, and so on. Teams are required to fit a minimum of nine local players under the squad salary cap of $1.15m; up to nine overseas players can be selected but a maximum of six are allowed in each starting XI. Games for the inaugural tournament have been scheduled mostly at night to cater to US viewers, rather than during hours more suitable to the TV audience in India. “Americans don’t like to be lectured about a sport that’s being played elsewhere,” says Mehta. “But if the sport’s being played in their country right next to them, they are absolute sports fanatics, and they will sample anything and everything. Our view is that T20 is an amazing sport for US consumption and for US audiences. It fits in with what Americans like to consume: it’s three hours long, there’s lots of action, it has some similarities with baseball but then has a lot of compelling differences also.”\nThe format of the inaugural tournament is straightforward: the six teams will play each other once, and the top four sides will contest three qualification and elimination games before the final is held on 30 July. Three of the group games will be played at a 3,000-capacity ground in North Carolina; the rest will take place at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. Major League Cricket is promising a 30-camera, world class broadcast production at both venues for the games, which will be shown live on Willow TV, with a mainstream broadcast partner set to be announced before the opening fixture. In future years, Mehta hopes, the league will expand to 10 teams with a longer season.\nThe teams for the inaugural season seem genuinely competitive and evenly matched, with the possible exception of the Seattle Orcas, who are likely to depend very heavily on the fluctuating powers of Quinton de Kock. The San Francisco Unicorns sport incredible hitting strength (Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade), while Washington Freedom have perhaps the league’s most balanced squad, boasting pace (Nortje, Marco Jansen), middle-order power (Josh Philippe, Moises Henriques), and world cricket’s best T20 all-rounder (Hasaranga). The Los Angeles Knight Riders mix T20 A-listers (Adam Zampa, Jason Roy), veterans (Martin Guptill), exuberantly named locals (Shadley van Schalkwyk), and mercurial post-international mercenaries capable of devastating displays of power hitting (Andre Russell, Rilee Roussow) in a proportion that already feels, despite the league’s immaturity, canonical.\nThe Texas Super Kings, meanwhile, are very dependent on du Plessis and an aging Dwayne Bravo, but they also boast dual-passport Australian-American “local” Cameron Stevenson, who’s the only player in the tournament to have his profile photo featured on both the official MLC website and the “about” page of a Melbourne-based civil engineering firm. Stevenson played professional cricket for Tasmania for two years until 2018 and now works as an engineer for the firm that reshaped Grand Prairie Stadium into a cricket ground; he qualifies as a local for MLC purposes thanks to his American mother. It’s curiosities like this that give MLC its special charm, but the magic is not confined solely to the league’s less heralded names. Celebrated ex-players want their part of history: Stephen Fleming, Lasith Malinga, and Shane Watson are all involved in MLC as coaches. MI New York boast an outstanding bowling attack that includes Rabada, Trent Boult and Jason Behrendorff, but its crowning glory is Rashid Khan, captain of Afghanistan and the world’s top ranked T20 bowler. More than two decades on from the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, Major League Cricket presents the tantalizing prospect of a genuine Afghan superstar – a man who grew up in the kiln of the US occupation and whose family was forced into exile for several years during the worst of the violence – exhibiting his wrist-spinning artistry on an American field of play. Despite the sport’s long history in the US, cricket’s latest assault on America feels somehow novel, like the stage for a fresh encounter between two parts of the world that have rarely understood each other in anything other than antagonistic terms.\nAs the Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders get ready to launch the league under lights at Grand Prairie Stadium on Thursday night, possibility and peril hover over Major League Cricket in equal measure, along with a faint air of mystery. What is it that’s driven this curious collection of Silicon Valley executives, journeyman foreign cricket administrators, obscure local players and star international cricketers to gather in a converted baseball stadium in suburban Dallas for three weeks in the middle of the Texas summer? Does cricket, growing impressively in its core markets and wildly popular among the two billion people of South Asia, really need America? It seems like the collective motivation here involves something more than just money, something to do with the abiding need for the rest of the world to feel validated by finding success in America (though it may just be money). Texas Super Kings assistant coach Eric Simons has claimed – half-jokingly, one assumes, but only half – that one day his team will be “bigger than the New York Yankees”. Soma Somasegar, a Seattle-based venture capitalist who’s one of the leading investors in MLC, believes in “the potential for the United States to become one of the leading cricket nations in the world”. Measuring that bounding ambition against the reality of the league’s first tournament should make for a fascinating spectacle, both on and off the field. The international stars have arrived. The local talent is emerging. And the VC money is in the bank. The rest, now, is down to America and its 330 million-strong sports- and TV-mad public."

Here’s what you need to know.\nThe United States will get its first taste of professional cricket on Thursday night with the launch of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC). Six teams will compete in T20, the quickest version of the game, with matches taking part across two sites with some serious star power on display for its first season.\nIf you’ve never watched cricket before, you’re curious about the sport, or just want to see what it’s all about then buckle in, because here’s everything you need to know in order be prepared for the first ball on Thursday night.\nThe “20” in T20 stands for the overs each side has to score runs. An over is six balls delivered by a single bowler in succession. At that time a new bowler takes over, bowls six balls, and the process continues.\nTeams need to score as many runs as possible off the 180 balls as possible, and have 10 wickets (or outs) to make this happen.\nBecause of the need to score extremely quickly to build a big lead or chase the opponent’s total, T20 is traditionally where you see players swing for the fences and take the most risks while batting. There’s also innate strategy built into the batting order, when to use spin bowling as opposed to fast bowling, as well as balancing the risk/reward of taking shots that could rack up runs, but at the cost of giving up easy wickets.\nThese teams will compete at two dedicated sites for the first season. A 12,000 seat cricket ground has been opened in Grand Prairie, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), with a 7,000 seat ground operating in Morrisville, North Carolina (part of the Raleigh-Durham area). \nThe inaugural season boasts the best players in the United States (many of whom even the most dedicated cricket fans haven’t heard of), alongside some surprisingly big names from international cricket. Of the international players entering the league we have: \nAt one point all of these players were some of the best T20 players in the world and all represented their countries at an international level. \nMLC has partnered with cricket streaming service WillowTV for broadcast rights in the United States. Internationally it can be watched in Australia (FOX), the Caribbean (SportsMax), New Zealand (Sky NZ), Pakistan (A Sports), South Africa (SuperSport) and the United Kingdom (BT Sport), and India (Viacom18).\nThe first match between the Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders will take place at 8:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, July 13.\n\n\nGAMBLING PROBLEM?

  "body": "sportsOther Sports\nBy Peter Rauterkus\n7:00 AM on Jul 12, 2023 CDT\nFor many in the Dallas area, Thursday’s Major League Cricket opening night will be their introduction to the sport.\nIf you are in that number, The Dallas Morning News has you covered.\nCricket has been a global staple for almost 200 years in the sports world. The first international sporting event of any kind was a cricket match between the United States and Canada in 1844. Today, the sport still draws hundreds of millions of viewers from across the globe. India, Pakistan, England and Australia are just a few of the countries that drive that viewership, and India is set to host the upcoming 2023 Cricket World Cup.\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\nWith America’s early British influence, cricket was once the most popular bat-and-ball sport in the U.S. before eventually getting beaten out by baseball.\nWith that historical context, here are a few things to know when watching cricket for the first time.\nThis summer is Major League Cricket’s inaugural season, and most of the games will take place at Grand Prairie Stadium. The league includes six teams – the Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom. Even though the teams are attached to different regions, they will all play matches in either Grand Prairie or Morrisville, N.C.\nEach team is backed by a bigger cricket entity that runs teams in T20 leagues around the world, many of which in the ultra-popular Indian Premier League.\nThe matches will be played in the T20 format, meaning they will last around three hours and be limited to 20 overs per innings (more on that later).\nMany high-profile international players and investors will take part in the inaugural Major League Cricket season. Each team is allowed up to nine international players, and no more than six are allowed on the field at a time.\nCricket involves two teams of 11 playing each other on an oval-shaped field trying to score the most runs. Two batsmen stand in the center of the field, called the pitch, where one tries to hit the ball delivered by the bowler. On each end of the pitch is a wicket, a set of three stumps and two bails. Each batsman stands in front of the wickets and will exchange places if the ball is hit. Each exchange equals one run.\nIf the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the field, it’s worth four runs -- hit it over the boundary and it’s worth six.\nThe other team tries to get them out by knocking the bail off the stump of the wicket with the ball before the batsmen complete an exchange.\nThe fielding team can also get a batsman out by catching a hit ball in the air or if the bowler hits the wicket, knocking the bails off the stumps. A batsman can choose not to swing or swing and miss at the ball, but is only out if the ball knocks the bails off the stumps of the wicket.\nTo put it in basic terms, the most excitement and cheers come when the ball is hit far, similar to baseball.\nThere are a few different forms of cricket but they all fall under two categories, First-Class Cricket and Limited Overs Cricket. The difference is in the name.\nFirst-Class Cricket is the original form of the sport, and takes multiple days due to there being no overs limit. Each team has two innings in First-Class Cricket and bats until the entire team has recorded an out in each innings.\nThe two most common forms of Limited Overs Cricket are One-Day International and T20 Cricket. The difference between the two is how many overs there are. One-Day International, which is played in international cricket, has 50 overs, while T20 has 20 overs.\nT20 is the form Major League Cricket will play and is the format played by most professional leagues.\nEach form features a single inning per team, and the inning is complete when either 10 of the 11 batters are out or the set number of overs has been reached. One-Day International matches usually last around nine hours and T20 matches usually last around three.\nThe weeds of scorekeeping can get confusing, but the most important thing to know is that whoever scores more runs wins. When looking at a scoreboard, though, you may see numbers indicating the wickets and overs.\nHow exactly the scoreboard reads depends on which form of cricket is being played, but for T20 cricket, the runs, overs and wickets are what you’ll want to pay attention to. A scoreboard will often display the batting team’s runs next to their wickets in the innings. Then it will display how many overs and deliveries there have been in the innings and the opposing team’s score which may be labeled as the target.\nA bowler can only bowl six deliveries at a time, which is called an over. After a bowler completes an over, the fielding team must switch bowlers. A player can bowl multiple times in an innings, but can’t bowl consecutive overs.\nThink of overs as at-bats, except the change from player to player between each over happens with the bowlers, not the batsmen. The batsmen do not change until they get out.\nThere are several ways a batter or runner can get out, and they can be mostly categorized in two categories: a batsman can be caught out or the fielding team can knock the bail off the stumps of the wicket.\nWhile being caught out only comes from a ball being caught in the air, there are a few ways a team can get a batsman out by knocking the bails off the stumps of the wicket.\nHere are the most common ways an out can be recorded.\nThe fielding team must appeal to the umpire if they believe they got a batsman out who will confirm the out. If one of these occurrences happens and no one notices, the out won’t be called.\nOn Twitter: @peter_rauterkus\nPeter Rauterkus.

I feel like game is easy because you just got to go there and execute, right, because your muscle memory is there,” Malhodra said. “But in practice, you're trying different things, which makes it a little more harder. But that's when you prepare for a real game.”\nStanding by are a staff of coaches and a medical team to ensure proper hydration and recovery as North Texas sizzles under the heat dome.\n\"All these guys have gotten used to playing in these type of temperature and which is an advantage,\" Sagar Manoharan said. Manoharan is the strength and conditioning coach for the LA Knight Riders. \"Abu Dhabi and also India in the season happens during summer, peak summer. So, we are dealing with pretty much the same temperature and humidity.\"\nThe Texas Super Kings will face the LA Knight Riders for the nation's first-ever Major League Cricket game at the outdoor Grand Prairie Stadium.\nSpectators are encouraged to bring umbrellas as shade is limited in the stadium."

  "body": "9 homes with unusual layouts and stunning views\nAt a redesigned former minor league baseball stadium in Dallas on Thursday night, another entrant into the crowded T20 cricket market will hope to finally break into America.\nIt took a decade before owners of Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises started to become profitable. Given that four of the six team backers in Major League Cricket (MLC) — the first-ever professional T20 league in the US — also own IPL sides, the nascent competition has already been given rich grounding.\n“Like any start-up you stay patient and keep plugging away,” Venky Harinarayan, co-owner of San Francisco Unicorns, told Yahoo Finance.\nRead More: T20 franchise contracts set to change cricket's global outlook\nA reported $120m (£92m) has initially been pumped in to launch MLC, which has landed some heavy hitters to fund the project, not only from the IPL franchise coffers but also from technology and media sectors. Notably Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (MSFT), who is part of the Seattle Orcas ownership group, and Adobe Inc (ADBE) CEO Shantanu Narayen.\nThe four IPL owners are from Delhi Capitals (Seattle Orcas), Kolkata Knight Riders (Los Angeles), Chennai Super Kings (Texas) and Mumbai Indians (New York). The other MLC teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom, both with Indian links.\nTalks began around five years ago when the International Cricket Council (ICC) rebooted USA Cricket and cleared up the operating body after years of governance issues. American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) were also taken on as investors, with the four founders granted a license to run a T20 league.\nWatch: Major League Cricket coming to Grand Prairie\nHarinarayan, a partner at San Francisco Bay-based Rocketship, the early-stage venture capital fund, said: “There was interest from ICC for a T20 league to promote the sport. That factor felt like it fit really well. Ashes notwithstanding, it’s the format that’s starting to take over.\n“It was clear pretty early on that it wouldn't be a case of writing a cheque and magic would happen. There was a fair amount of work at ground level to take it off the ground over the last three years.\n“It’s a labour of love to some degree. I don’t think any of the owners are doing it purely from a financial outcome. All of us being business folks, the long term viability of cricket in the US and the financial outcomes are positive. In the near term it’s about being in investment mode and trying to grow the seeds.”\nFor now, the San Francisco Unicorns won’t be playing in California. The inaugural MLC season will be played in Dallas — starting on 13 July with a sell-out between Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders — with the six teams playing across 18 days at the 7,000-seater Grand Prairie Stadium and at a venue in North Carolina.\n“There is a lot going for cricket in the US,” added Harinarayan, a Chennai native. “There is a big expat population with South Asian and Indian Americans. There is incredible passion from the expats and the other piece which is interesting is the pretty high per capita income as well.\n“That in my mind is the business case and being able to expand to a broader market. Like every start-up you look for a beachhead. You don’t try to own everything from day one.”\nThe US market presents both challenges and opportunities for the team owners — and whether MLC can redirect the cricket passion to the current cities where the expats live.\nRead More: IPL: Gujarat Titans, 'the Manchester City of T20 cricket'\n“We know they are super passionate,” added Harinarayan. “We know they support cricket teams. Let’s say you are a Pakistani living in San Francisco and you support the Pakistan team. The question is whether you can support your local team.\n“In an ideal world we would love to play in every city and build fan engagement. The goal is to play where the franchises are represented. There is the opportunity in the medium term and the T20 format is really well suited to an American audience.\nThe four IPL franchises aiming for more global riches have given the MLC a “huge shot of credibility” in its first season. However Hemant Dua, Delhi Daredevils’ former CEO, believes that the competition still has challenges in both broadcasting and infrastructure.\nHe said: “From a broadcast point of view, it’s not great timing for India if the games are going to happen in the evening [US time]. If you have the games in the morning, it would be beaming to India in the evening.\n“They still don't have the infrastructure and it will take time to build stadiums. Once all that is done, things will probably change. So this is going to be more testing than anything else.”\nThe hope is that MLC will be boosted when the US host matches in next year’s T20 World Cup alongside the West Indies, while the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles may include cricket on the Games’ programme.\nThe MLC is also not short of world-class players: Faf du Plessis, Kieron Pollard, Wayne Parnell and Anrich Nortje are just some of the stars who will be on show this month.\nRead More: How the IPL has impacted 'dying' Test cricket\nHarinarayan said: “We have been energised by the interest of the top players who want to play in the US. Every one of our teams would start up pretty well against any team in any T20 league.\nFormer Australia captain Aaron Finch will lead the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural edition, alongside the likes of Aaron Finch, Liam Pllunkett and Corey Anderson. The Unicorns have also partnered with Australian body Cricket Victoria, who will provide a general manager, coach and cricket operations.\n“It’s rare you get the chance to create a start-up in the world of cricket and that’s exciting,” added Harinarayan.\nWatch: How cricket is gaining traction in the US\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\nThe last time a parliamentary session was ended by a male sovereign was in 1951.\nHe’s shared his views on ‘Sherlock’ star’s mysterious decision to quit BBC series\n‘Sherlock’ star’s post has intensified rumours of a ‘feud’\nIn 1914, Argentina had essentially arrived as a wealthy country.

Cricket, baby,\" Samnani said.\n\n    Related\n  \nA popular sport in other parts of the world comes to North Texas. It's one way to stay active while beating the heat.\n\"It’s a historic day for cricket in America and cricket in Texas,\" said Tom Dunmore, with Major League Cricket. \"These are the world’s best players coming here to the Dallas area to play professional cricket.\"\nWhat is this global sport?\n\"It’s like baseball with 10 times the energy and action, which sounds funny because people think cricket might be a slow game, but the ball is actually in play a lot more,\" Dunmore said.\n\"I would say within an hour you’ll know what’s going on,\" Samnami said.\nSome fans came from out of town, and one fan attended from South Africa.\nMajor League Cricket hopes to establish a cricket culture in North Texas.\nThursday’s match to a crowd of thousands is just the beginning.\nThe teams will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\nMost of the matches will be held in Grand Prairie, with some others played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nThe new league opens its season on Thursday at Grand Prairie Stadium.\nGrand Prairie Mayor Ron Jensen says he's heard from people across the region and from other countries who are interested in the sport.\nJensen says there are more than 400,000 North Texans who subscribe to WILLOW, a TV channel dedicated to 24/7 cricket coverage. He says the best way to enjoy the sport is to get out and watch it.\n\"It's really not that complicated once you get out and watch a game,\" said Jensen. \"It's very simple, high-scoring, there's going to be a lot of runs scored, so it is very exciting.\"\n\"Think of it as a baseball game, with ten times what happens in a baseball game,\" said Srinivasan. \nAll the news you need to know, every day\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirmthat I have read and agreeto the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2023 FOX Television Stations"

  "body": "CRICKET is a popular sport in India that is similar to American baseball.\nThe popularity of it has soared in the United States in recent years, which is why a professional league was formed. \nMajor League Cricket was founded in January 2019 and is expected to begin play in July 2023. \nThe league, which is operated by American Cricket Enterprises and sanctioned by USA Cricket, consists of six professional teams. \nThose teams include: \nMost sports leagues in the United States are made up of either one or more owners, however, the MLC is different. \nThere is no owner of the league itself, there are just individual owners of the teams.  \nThe MLC team owners include: \nSports is a booming business in the United States, which is why NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL players often sign multi-million dollar contracts, but this is ultimately not the case for MLC players. \nBecause cricket is still a relatively new sport in the US, players' salaries are a fraction of what other professional athletes see. \nAs of this writing, the average salary of an MLC player is $60,526, according to Broken Cricket Dreams. \nEach team in the league is allowed a maximum of 19 players and has a $1.15million purse. \nThe players' individual salaries depend on a number of things, including what round they were drafted in. \nPlayers drafted in the first round often have a $75,000 salary while those drafted in the eighth round get about $10,000. \nIf the popularity continues to soar, athletes could see an increase in those salaries as time goes on.  \n© 2020 THE SUN, US, INC.

  "source": "Washington Post",
  "body": "Matt Thacker is the managing editor of Wisden (U.K.) Cricket Monthly.\nIn 1987, comedian Robin Williams told a British audience: “We have baseball. You have cricket, which is like baseball on Valium.” Some 30 years before that, Groucho Marx, in London watching a match at Lord’s, the spiritual home of cricket, concluded: “What a wonderful cure for insomnia.”\nAmericans might hold similar views of cricket as it is being played this summer by England and Australia in “the Ashes,” so called because, in 1882, the Sporting Times published a mock obituary for the game after England lost — “deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances. R.I.P. … The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.”\nBut the Ashes is “Test” cricket, in which the matches last five full days, with no guarantee of either side winning. The five-match series began in mid-June and won’t be completed until the end of July.\nThat kind of cricket is not to be confused with the fast-paced brand making its debut in the United States this summer with Major League Cricket. The inaugural match was played Thursday night  at the 7,200-capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas.\nMajor League Cricket plays Twenty20 or T20 cricket, a version of the sport that, to the horror of cricket traditionalists, has dramatically shortened matches, appealing to diminished attention spans and the wishes of TV executives who want games that start and finish within a few hours.\nThe matches involve 20 overs per side (an over consists of six balls delivered, or thrown, by the bowler to a batsman — a baseball fan would consider them pitches), three hours max, multiple sixes (home runs, if you must), stunning athleticism and all the razzamatazz you would expect of any sporting occasion in the United States.\nDomestic T20 leagues have proliferated across the cricket-playing world and enjoy more cachet with millions of fans than the stodgier international game.\nThe arrival of T20 in the United States was perhaps inevitable, given the country’s increasing population of immigrants from cricket-mad India, Pakistan and the Caribbean.\nMili Mitra: The most inspiring World Cup story this month isn’t what you’d expect\nBut it isn’t as though the United States is without cricket history. The sport’s first-ever international match was between the United States and Canada, played in New York in 1844. And, of course, baseball traces its roots to a form of cricket called rounders.\nIt is perhaps fitting, then, that Major League Cricket launched Thursday night at the renovated former home of the Texas AirHogs minor league baseball team, with the Texas Super Kings comfortably defeating the Los Angeles Knight Riders in front of a full house. The Super Kings’ captain, South African Faf du Plessis, praised the contributions from homegrown American talent, saying it’s “good to see the local boys perform.”\nThe league’s four other sides are Washington Freedom, Seattle Orcas, San Francisco Unicorns and MI New York (MI for its association with the Mumbai Indians). Each side is allowed a roster of 16 to 19 players, with a maximum of nine international players and a minimum of 10 domestic players (one of them an under-23). The matchday side can have a maximum of six overseas players.\nThe game in Grand Prairie commenced a 17-day tournament, with the league’s six teams boasting a genuinely impressive cricketing cast list from all over the world.\nMajor League Cricket’s financial backing includes $120 million from investors, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe Chair and CEO Shantanu Narayen. The league’s strategic partner, American Cricket Enterprises, is backed by Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, founders of Willow TV (the largest cricket broadcaster in North America, with more than 4 million subscribers) and the Times Group, one of India’s largest media companies.\nTwo of the MLC team franchises have partnered with Australian cricket sides, and the other four are owned by groups that run teams in India. The matches are likely to appeal to anyone from cricket-playing countries around the globe, but make no mistake: The MLC project is driven by Indian interest in the sport.\nWith an Indian American population of 4.8 million and growing, and the fact that they are the United States’ highest earning ethnic group, the thought process for starting a U.S. league is clear — in India, the sports market is 90 percent dominated by cricket.\nThe introduction of T20 cricket in the United States this summer might be a harbinger of something bigger: The World Cup will be held next year in the West Indies and United States, a major breakthrough for the sport in the land of baseball, and there are rumors that cricket will be added as an Olympic sport for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\nIt’s a shame Robin Williams and Groucho Marx aren’t around to see the changes — as many Americans may soon discover, there’s no danger of dozing off in modern cricket."

  "body": "The inaugural season of the Major League Cricket concluded at the Grand Prairie Stadium in suburban Dallas, with MI New York being crowned as the first champion. Stand-in captain Nicholas Pooran played a swashbuckling knock, scoring an unbeaten 137 runs off just 55 balls, which helped the Big Apple franchise secure victory against the formidable Seattle Orcas â€“ a team that had appeared to be the strongest until the final match. At the halfway stage, Seattleâ€™s 183 for 9 looked like a challenging total, but MI New York achieved the target with four overs left, thanks to Pooranâ€™s superlative innings.\nThe morning after the end of Season 1, one thing is clear: MLC is here to stay.\nWhile some may view it as a bold prediction for a fledgling league that has just completed its first season and hosted fewer than 15 matches, the quality of entertainment and the passionate response from fans indicate that cricket has found a solid foothold in the United States.\nREAD: Breathtaking hundred by Heinrich Klaasen helps Seattle Orcas defeat MI New York (July 25, 2023)\nHere are a few things that serve as signposts that MLC will be embraced by the American audience and become a part of the US sporting landscape.\nQuality of cricket:\nThe quality of cricket in the first year of MLC has been above average. Many of the bigwigs that the teams signed did not fail to deliver. West Indies T20 international Nicholas Pooran, who singlehandedly won the final for MI New York, was the top scorer with 388 runs, at an impressive average of 64.66. Following him in the list of top scorers were two South African Orcas players, wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock who scored 264, and Heinrich Klaasen with 235 runs.\nWhile Pooranâ€™s innings defined the final, Klaasen scored a similarly breathtaking knock when MI New York and Orcas faced each other in the final league game in Morrisville. He scored a 44-ball 110 containing 9 fours and 7 sixes to help Orcas defeat MI New York.\nAmong bowlers, New Zealander Trent Boult was the top wicket-taker with 22 scalps. Notable performances included Washington Freedomâ€™s Mumbai-born left-arm fast-medium pacer Saurabh Netravalkarâ€™s six-wicket haul for just 9 runs against San Francisco during the league stage.\nREAD: Washington Freedom was a no-brainer of an investment: Sanjay Govil (July 17, 2023)\nMany US stars also performed well, including Seattleâ€™s Australia-born Cameron Gannon, who finished second among bowlers with 11 wickets, and New Yorkâ€™s Nosthusha Kenjige, who was born in Auburn, Alabama.\nThe excitement generated by these performances underlines the potential for cricket to capture the American imagination.\nFan engagement:\nFans, especially those from various South Asian diasporas, embraced MLC with both hands and showed up at the stadiums to root for their teams, braving the unusually hot July summer. In Morrisville, NC, most matches were sold out.\nREAD: Major League Cricket brings T20 competition to America (July 14, 2023)\nThe fan engagement in the first season shows that the foundation for cricket’s success in America is solid, given the presence of more than 6 million cricket enthusiasts from the South Asian American diaspora. Additionally, significant populations from cricket-loving regions like the Caribbean, Britain, and Australia add to the diverse and expansive fanbase that can sustain cricket in the US. This multicultural blend creates a unique cricketing community, ready to embrace the game with passion.\nMedia attention:\nMLC’s inaugural season received substantial coverage from major US news outlets such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, as well as prominent sports publications like ESPN. The interest shown by these media outlets, who previously viewed cricket as nothing more than a curiosity, indicates the sport’s growth trajectory.\nWhat does the future hold for MLC?\nWhile reaching the status of the four major sporting leagues â€” NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL â€” may be an unattainable goal for MLC in the foreseeable future, there is potential for it to reach popularity akin to Major League Soccer. Interestingly, MLC’s debut season coincided with the Major League Soccer debut of Lionel Messi, a sports superstar of global renown.\nAs Washington Freedom owner Sanjay Govil told the American Bazaar, there is enough space for cricket in the United States. America is known for its patronage of various sports, including golf, tennis, and lacrosse, providing ample opportunities for cricket to flourish outside the established leagues.\nREAD: Major League Cricket makes Viacom18 media partner in IndiaÂ (July 10, 2023)\nThe success of the inaugural season is likely to attract more elite and star cricketers from around the world, elevating the level of competition and increasing the game’s popularity. The presence of renowned players will undoubtedly draw more attention and create a ripple effect on the sport’s growth.\nAnother boost will be the construction of new stadiums. Already, teams like Freedom and Orcas are moving ahead with plans for their own stadiums, indicating their willingness to invest in the sport’s infrastructure. World-class stadium experiences will further enhance the appeal of MLC matches and encourage greater fan participation.\nOver time, MLC will add more teams. It is likely that those teams from the Indian Premier League that sat out this year will join during the expansion drive, as will men and women from the South Asian diaspora with deep pockets that missed out during the first round.\nAnother positive to emerge in the first season was the enthusiasm shown by some of the owners to be at the park and root for their teams.\nFor the final, MI owner Nita Ambani, the wife of billionaire Mukesh Ambani and the team’s superfan, flew all the way from Mumbai, indicating that the Ambanis see the US market as more than just an outpost of cricket.\nFreedomâ€™s Govil was present for every match his team played. Seattleâ€™s Sanjay Parthasarathy and Texas Super Kingâ€™s Anurag Jain were also at the stadium rooting for their teams on many game days.\nThe success of MLCâ€™s inaugural season demonstrated that cricket could find a secure home in America. The quality of cricket, the media attention, and the passionate fan response are clear indicators that the path ahead for MLC is promising. While challenges lie ahead, the sport’s vibrant and diverse fanbase, coupled with growing infrastructure and investments, is bound to secure cricket’s place as a beloved sport in the United States. The future of cricket in America is bright, and Major League Cricket is set to play a significant role in its journey.\nAB Wire stories are filed by American Bazaar staff writers and contributors.

  "body": "Major League Cricket has arrived in Texas. The big question is whether the sport can catch on in the land of opportunity. Once upon a time in America, cricket was the national game. It was also the location of the sport’s very first international match. That may sound like a Ripley's Believe it or Not! fact, but ‘New York, New York’ is where it all started.\nThe USA and Canada played that historic game in front of 10,000 spectators at NYC’s Bloomingdale Park in 1844. It may be some time before cricket crowds are packed to the rafters in America again. This is not the MLB. Or Frank Sinatra.\nTOPSHOT - Englands Jason Roy plays with his bat he walks off the field after being dismissed by ...

(Photo by Munir uz ZAMAN / AFP) (Photo by MUNIR UZ ZAMAN/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium, a converted baseball venue, hosts the opening match of the MLC between the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders in front of a capacity 7,200 crowd on Thursday. The 19-match tournament runs to the end of July and will also use North Carolina’s Church Street Park with a capacity currently at 3,500.\nThe faster-paced T20 games have been turned into popular franchises in Pakistan, Australia, the Caribbean and England. The big shot of them all, the Indian Premier League, recently become the most-watched digital sports event globally. The IPL is a multi-million dollar machine, generating over $15m broadcasting fees per match, and coming second only to the NFL as the richest league in the world.\nThe cash cricket cow that is the IPL has seen big funding from American investors, including the likes of Silver Lake Partners, TPG Capital and KKR\n  KKR\n  and Co. The format of three-hour games filled with huge hits, world-class talent from all over the globe, pitchside entertainment and premium technology in impressive stadia makes this a very desirable product to replicate. Major League Cricket has the finances. It now needs the optics, facilities and audience.\nKolkata Knight Riders, owned by Bollywood superstar, Shah Rukh Khan, was the first IPL franchise to invest in the MLC. They have taken a stake in the LA team as well as committing to a brand-new cricket site in Southern California. The idea is for all six teams to have their own stadiums in the next three to five years. “Our investment in MLC in America is based on our belief in the exciting future of cricket in the U.S.A and is well aligned to our strategy of establishing Knight Riders as a global brand in T20 cricket,\" said Khan.\nThree other IPL franchises have followed suit with the Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, and Delhi Capitals anchoring the Texas, New York and Seattle teams respectively. Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has teamed up to provide similar services to Washington Freedom. The league has also been sanctioned officially by the International Cricket Council. This is a serious moonshot.\nFILE - Kolkata Knight Riders' Andre Russell plays a shot during Indian Premier League cricket match ...

George Bernard Shaw asserted “the English are not very spiritual people so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.” That might explain why cricket has flourished to such an extent in Britain and some of its former colonies but never to the same degree in the United States. (AP Photo Bikas Das, File)\nWith an estimated 30 million cricket fans in the USA, bolstered by South Asian and Caribbean immigrants, there is an existing community to capture. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft\n  MSFT\n  and a part-owner of the Seattle Sounders franchise in Major League Soccer, is one of the leading investors in the initial outlay of $120m into the MLC.\nBroadcasters include Willow TV and Viacom18 in India. “Our six teams feature T20 players who fans in India love to watch, and they (Viacom) are the right partner to showcase sports broadcasts in the world’s largest cricket market,” said Vijay Srinivasan , co-Founder of the MLC. The Indian subcontinent holds all the cards when it comes to cricket fanatics.\nThere is enough global quality on show too. Sri Lanka's Wanindu Hasaranga is one of the world’s best T20 all-rounders. Mitchell Marsh hit a swashbuckling century for Australia with huge sixes in the Headingley Ashes Test match. Pakistan’s Haris Rauf, West Indian Sunil Narine and England’s big-hitting Jason Roy are also among the stars aiming to drive home the entertainment ticket to the masses.\nRoy cancelled the incremental contract with his country for what could be a sum of between £150-200k (up to $260m) for just over two weeks’ work across the pond. If players see the dollar signs more than strict loyalty to their nation, then the MLC might be doing something right. It’s worth noting that the founders insist they are not trying to tread on anyone’s toes. The carrot is being dangled though.\nIn 2024, the USA are due to co-host the flagship ICC T20 World Cup tournament alongside the West Indies which opens the door to an even bigger audience. Recent reports hinted that the vital infrastructure in the country was not ready. However, the ICC confirmed that there are no plans to shift the venue to England as reported. The task now is for the United States to put together a team that is competitive in the next 12 months and keep developing the quality environment that such events demand.\nThe development of Minor League Cricket in 2021 has been important in encouraging homegrown stars. The next two and a half weeks will provide a perfect platform for exposure. If Chris Eubanks can come out of nowhere, then who knows which latent talent can rise to the surface.\nThe field of dreams has arrived but without Kevin Costner and no baseball bat. “Don’t find customers for your products, find products for your customers,” said American author Seth Godin. That model may be about to be strongly tested as cricket looks for a rebirth Stateside.\n"

  "body": "businessLocal Companies\nBy Sasha Richie\n6:00 AM on Jul 10, 2023 CDT\nGrand Prairie is set to transform into “Cricket City, USA” this week as a new professional sports league launches with some of the biggest names in the sport, even if those players are little known in the U.S.\nAfter spending $20 million renovating the former independent league baseball AirHogs Stadium and recruiting big-name executives to invest in the startup league, bowlers and batsmen are set to take the pitch Thursday for the first match in an 18-day test of whether the fervor for the sport translates across the globe from India and South Africa to the United States.\nSix teams, each attached to a city and featuring some of the world’s best cricketers, will compete in an abbreviated form of cricket that decides a victor in about three hours. Top international names like England’s Jason Roy and Sri Lanka’s Wanindu Hasaranga have joined the league. There are 19 matches scheduled over 18 days, including round-robin play and four championship playoff games. Most are played at Grand Prairie Stadium with some in Morrisville, N.C.\nBecome a business insider with the latest news.\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\nNow, with domestic interest in the sport on the rise, USA Cricket, Major League Cricket co-founder Vijay Srinivasan and investors like Anurag Jain believe it’s time for the U.S. to have its own premier cricket product. All are based in Grand Prairie.\n“July 13, 2023, is going to be somewhat historic,” said Marty Wieder, Grand Prairie director of economic development. “We can become Cricket City, USA.”\nMajor League Cricket faces an uphill battle with few venues in the U.S. and low participation at the youth and amateur levels, where interest in the sport is fostered.\nThe sport’s U.S. governing body, USA Cricket, also faces financial difficulties and has yet to name a CEO after multiple leadership departures. It’s put the organization in continued conflict with cricket’s global leaders.\nSports leagues in general are hard to start, especially in a country with no recent history with cricket.\nThe sport has been played for centuries in England, and international events have boosted its commercial potential in Commonwealth countries. But the U.S. has rarely been good enough to qualify for international events like the World Cup that would have put the sport on Americans’ minds, as men’s and women’s World Cups did for soccer.\nAnd pro cricket doesn’t have school sports participation to build on like other upstart leagues such as Major League Soccer and the Premier Lacrosse League.\nProfessional cricket supporters aren’t expecting to challenge the nation’s more established sports  overnight.\n“Major League Cricket has been very cautious and very conservative,” Wieder said. “We’ll see in this first year, economically, what kind of impact it’ll have. We know it’ll be better than what we had when we had independent baseball.”\nMajor League Cricket does have some things in its favor. What Americans would think of as professional cricket, usually called franchised cricket, is relatively new globally. The Indian Premier League, now one of the biggest sports leagues in the world, was started in 2008. Popular leagues in other countries began even later.\n“When I first came in and started talking about … cricket, I think [my previous city manager] really shook his head and wondered about me,” Wieder said. “But I think he even realizes, yeah, this has got legs. This is going to be big for Grand Prairie.”\nMinor League Cricket, a developmental league, has already played two seasons, and the U.S. has already been chosen to co-host the 2024 T20 World Cup with the West Indies. Some of those matches are expected to be played in the newly converted stadium.\nThe Indian Premier League is by far the most popular venue for cricket, earning nearly $17 million per match, the third-most of any sports league in the world. Its opening match this season garnered 130 million viewers, more than the 2023 Super Bowl.\nThe sport’s popularity is mostly concentrated in Commonwealth countries made up of the United Kingdom and its former colonies. It’s the dominant sport in nations such as India, Pakistan and Australia and an estimated billion people watched India and Pakistan play in the 2015 World Cup.\n“Cricket is not just a sport,” the investor Jain said. “Cricket is a way of life.”\nCricket has been played in the U.S. as far back as the Revolutionary War. But in the late 1800s, it lost the battle to baseball as America’s favorite bat-and-ball sport.\nA wave of South Asian immigrants in the 1990s brought their appetite for cricket with them to the United States.\nMajor League Cricket co-founders Sameer Mehta and Srinivasan capitalized on that and created one of the world’s first subscription sports live-streaming sites: Willow.tv in 2002. In 2010, the service expanded to a satellite TV station, and then to cable in 2012, using a subscription model like HBO or NFL Network.\nIn 2016, they sold the station to the Times Group, an Indian media conglomerate.\n“We were reaching a few million households,” Srinivasan said. “And we had realized that in broadcasting cricket to an audience here in the U.S., for so many years, one of our biggest frustrations was that we had never actually broadcast any matches that happened in the U.S.”\nMeanwhile, after tumult regarding its predecessor as the U.S.’s sanctioning cricket body, USA Cricket solicited proposals to bring cricket to the states.\nLovkesh Kalia, a Dallas-area hospitality businessman and former board member of USA Cricket’s predecessor, contacted Grand Prairie’s economic officials. Kalia said Grand Prairie could become the hub for cricket in the U.S.\nAfter identifying Grand Prairie as home base, Srinivasan and Mehta, under the banner of American Cricket Enterprises, sent their proposal to USA Cricket. The group would create Major League Cricket, but not without the proper support: funding cricket infrastructure across the country, a development league that came to be Minor League Cricket, and cultivating interest among Americans.\nAccording to Srinivasan, 20 groups sent proposals, and six were chosen as finalists. What placed the Texas group and their proposal for Major League Cricket above the rest was the duo’s experience with Willow.\n“We had a lot of data relative to cricket live audiences, what are the strongest markets in the U.S., and so on,” Srinivasan said.\nThe proposal was attractive to investors, too. American Cricket Enterprises has raised $44 million, including backing from Jain, Ross Perot Jr. and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who all joined as team owners or co-owners. Jain and Perot are co-owners of the Texas Super Kings, Dallas-Fort Worth’s hometown team.\nIn 2021, after being granted USA Cricket’s exclusive sanction, American Cricket Enterprises partnered with Grand Prairie to redevelop Grand Prairie Stadium into a cricket field.\nPrevious attempts at professional cricket such as Pro Cricket and the American Premier League used minor league baseball stadiums without making them true cricket grounds.\nFew cities in the U.S. have stadiums equipped to handle cricket, with its unique round field.\nThen came Grand Prairie. The Texas AirHogs, which played in the non-MLB-associated American Association, struggled to fill its stadium’s 7,000 seats, with average attendance hovering around 1,000. The team officially folded in 2020, leaving the stadium vacant.\nAfter securing the use of the venue, the Major League Cricket group set out to turn Grand Prairie Stadium into the U.S.’s premier cricket ground.\n“It’s a lot of stress if you’re me,” said Will Swann, vice president of corporate development and infrastructure and the league’s first hire tasked to redevelop the former minor league baseball field.\nThe cricket league started work on the stadium retrofit in July 2022, tearing down stands to accommodate the regulation cricket field and then adding more seating to bring it back to its 7,000-person capacity.\nAll the prior “vertical architecture” is there — suites, concessions, team areas and the sports bar in the outfield — which was the value of renovating an existing stadium in the first place, Swann said.\nMajor League Cricket spent $20 million on the project. The final product is a uniquely American cricket experience that blends some of the conventions of baseball stadiums with a much different sport.\n“It’s almost the perfect collision of cricket and baseball,” said Swann, who was born and raised a cricket fan and player in Australia.\nMost of the seats are concentrated in the pavilion area. The field is closer to the stands than it would be had it not been a converted ballpark.\n“If you’ve ever been to a minor league baseball game, you get to be really up close and personal,” Swann said. “And imagine that kind of feeling except you have the best players in the world walking out to play.”\nFor the players, too, it’ll be “pretty phenomenal,” he said. Major League Cricket has 26 to 30 cameras capturing each broadcast at the stadium, giving the broadcasts unique views that haven’t been available to the sport before.\nSingle-game tickets in Grand Prairie start at $24.\nThe other venue hosting games this summer outside Raleigh, N.C., seats just over 3,000. Grand Prairie Stadium will be the league’s primary stadium until all six teams can build venues. The league is also building a training field nearby in North Texas that’s expected to be ready before next year’s T20 World Cup.\nThe Dallas area was attractive as the seat for American cricket for a variety of reasons. Dallas has one of the country’s largest airports, DFW International Airport, and year-round warm weather. Jain also cited Dallas’ love of sports as a reason to invest time and money into bringing a cricket league here, especially with Dallas’ large investment community.\n“We just get stuff done in Dallas,” Jain said.\nThe league has offered discounted tickets to local amateur players and worked with youth academies on special nights for them. Some local players were drafted in the upstart league to form a relationship with the community such as University of Texas at Dallas junior and accounting major Ali Sheikh.\nEach Major League Cricket team is also partnered with established teams overseas. The Texas Super Kings are paired and named after the Chennai Super Kings in southern India, “the Manchester United of cricket,” as Jain put it. League executives are also counting on fans in India to tune in as they do with the Caribbean Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League.\nSrinivasan also knew from running Willow that there was a large base of people in Dallas who wanted to watch cricket. Dallas-Fort Worth has one of the largest South Asian communities in the country, with more than 212,000 Asian Indians alone in North Texas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That’s the fourth largest of any metropolitan area in the country. Many are cricket fans and play on Dallas’ numerous club and rec teams. There are also youth academies across the city.\nShreyas Viswanathan, a college freshman at Purdue University and Dallas resident, played in those academies and said he knew many people who moved to Dallas just to pursue cricket. Now, he runs The Cricket Chronicle blog and says he is one of thousands of local cricketers who are excited about Major League Cricket and ready to support it.\nSherwin Fernandes, another local cricketer and fan, said there has been a buzz in the community for the start of the season because of the chance to finally see some of the best cricketers live.\n“The who’s who of cricket is in the MLC,” Fernandes said.\nSasha Richie.

  "body": "If you’ve driven around Houston’s suburbs, you’ve probably passed a cricket field. Although certainly not as common as the city’s football fields, baseball parks or basketball courts, there have been plenty of cricket fields pop up in places like Pearland and Prairie View, both home to cricket stadiums built to host international events. Then there are smaller fields for more recreational use that have sprouted all over Fort Bend County.\nAlthough lesser known in the United States, cricket is the second-most popular sport in the world behind soccer, and that excitement could blossom further with the creation of Major League Cricket. The six-team professional league started play last week in front of sellout crowds with matches split between Grand Prairie Stadium — the 7,000 seat former home of the now-defunct independent minor league baseball’s Texas AirHogs — in Dallas-Fort Worth and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nTexas’ team — the Texas Super Kings — already are atop the standings at 2-1 and play again Friday night against the Seattle Orcas.\nHere’s everything you should know about the new cricket league and the sport’s growing popularity …\nNo, they don’t, actually. Although cricket has a reputation for matches that go on for literal days, Major League Cricket actually plays a version of the game known as Twenty20 or T20, which typically takes about three hours. In T20, each team gets a set number of balls to score as many runs as it can, creating a more fast-paced version of the popular game.\nAlthough the league is based in Grand Prairie, Houston has played a big role in the affair. The league’s draft was held at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in March and the league’s teams held their training camps at Prairie View Cricket Complex.\nThere are six teams in the league: Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, MI New York and Washington Freedom. There are some international stars in the league, including Harmeet Singh Baddhan, who was the No. 1 overall pick in the league's inaugural draft. Although all the matches are split between the two venues in Texas and North Carolina, each team has plans to build their own cricket stadiums with the ability to host matches in the coming years.\nAside from making the drive to Grand Prairie to watch a match in person, all the league's matches are streamed on Willow TV. If you want to see other cricket leagues, the Houston Cricket League has matches in town every Sunday.\nMatt Young is a trending sports reporter at the Houston Chronicle.

Major League Cricket’s inaugural tournament, six teams strong with rosters peppered with players from South Asia, is in full swing. (AP Photo/LM Otero)\nThe first professional franchise cricket league in the United States launched this month. Curious Americans, don’t worry. The games won’t take days. There won’t be hours-long periods of play when nothing seems to happen. And no extended breaks when the teams disappear for “lunch” or “tea.”\nInstead, expect an action-packed type of cricket, with batters going for big hits from the outset and fielders throwing themselves around in an attempt to make catches or stop runs.\nMajor League Cricket in the U.S. is using the Twenty20 format, also known in the business as T20, one of the game’s shortest, quickest and newest versions.\nThink of it as cricket 2.0.\nWhile cricket still has its traditional test matches, which last up to five days and have no other restrictions on how long an innings can take, T20 is a limited-overs game and gives each team a set number of balls to get as many runs as it can.\n\n        \n    \nThe upshot is a far more exciting chase to get quick runs before your 20 overs are up. Those 20 overs translate as 120 balls, or deliveries, to hit. Each team gets one inning of 20 overs, hence the name Twenty20.\nMajor League Cricket is launching partly because the T20 World Cup featuring the world’s best international teams is set be co-hosted by the U.S. next year.\nT20 was first played at franchise level in England in 2003. That makes it a baby in terms of cricket, which has been played in one form or another for at least 400 years.\nWithin four years, T20 had its own World Cup and it has spawned franchise leagues in all the major cricketing countries, as well as some not so familiar with the game. There are lucrative T20 leagues in India, Pakistan, England, Australia and South Africa, of course, but also in newer cricketing territories such as the Middle East, Canada and the Netherlands.\nMajor League Cricket is the newest T20 league in the world and Americans the latest audience to get a taste.\nThe two important factors with the T20 format: It hurries the game up, meaning, generally, much more excitement. The game is also shortened time-wise and takes around three hours to complete, making it comparable to a baseball game and therefore easier to consume for young fans or those new to the sport. \nYou can watch a T20 game on a Friday night instead of having to give up your entire day for a one-day international or week to keep track of a test match like the Ashes.\nWhile the format leads to fast and furious action on the field, T20 has also sparked an evolution in off-field entertainment in cricket. Cheerleaders dancing on podiums, DJs sitting behind decks spinning tunes and fancy dress themes are all part of the T20 game, bringing a colorful new twist for supporters at the stadium and viewers on TV or online.\nCompetitions for fans at the game are also common to create a party atmosphere, like offering money for anyone who can make a one-handed catch when the ball sails into the crowd. Unlike baseball, though, the ball must be returned to the field.\nCricket’s normal rules still apply in T20 games, meaning there might still be a steep learning curve for new fans unfamiliar with the leg before wicket law.\nAt least there will be no ties. Test cricket has two ways for a game to have no winner, even if it’s been going on for five days.\nBut in T20, if the teams get exactly the same number of runs — 150 runs is an average score and more than 200 a really good score — then there is a “Super Over” to decide the game. That means each team faces one over of six balls to smash as many runs as it can and whoever wins that tie-breaker wins the game.\nMajor League Cricket is up and running, having started last week. The tournament is being played at two venues, a former baseball park in Grand Prairie, Texas, and a cricket ground in Morrisville, North Carolina. There are six teams in the league, which has been in the pipeline since about 2018.\nThey are: MI New York, Los Angeles Knight Riders, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and the Washington Freedom.\nLike most T20 competitions, Major League Cricket has also attracted international stars. Los Angeles has South African Rilee Rossouw and San Francisco has Australian Aaron Finch. They are both in the top 10 batters in the world in T20 internationals.\nRashid Khan of Afghanistan, the top-ranked T20 bowler, is on New York’s roster as is Kagiso Rabada, one of the best fast bowlers in world cricket.\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

It's in my blood,\" he continued. \"I'm ready to go!\" \nThe sport is already huge overseas in places like South Asia, South Africa and Australia.

There’s an even bigger sport in town.  \n\n\n\n\tThis week, Major League Cricket will play its first-ever game in the U.S. and every last ticket to the highly anticipated opener has been sold. (Don’t worry, it’s also being broadcast live.) The Texas Super Kings will face off against the Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Thursday. The 6,000-person venue replaced the former home of the professional baseball team, the AirHogs. Anurag Jain, the managing partner of venture capitalist firm Perot Jain, is part-owner of the Texas Super Kings and founded the Dallas-based franchise earlier this year in hopes of creating a buzz stateside.  \n\n\t\n\n\n\t“My vested interest was to bring cricket right into the heart of America,” Jain told Bloomberg. “I see a lot of cricket being played one off, club level, league level, at the local levels. But not at the professional level and that’s what I really wanted to change.” \n\n\n\n\tCricket is currently ranked as the second-biggest sport in the world right behind soccer, and Jain’s not the only one betting on its future. Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside business mogul Jay Mehta, acquired the Knight Riders back in 2020 and has plans to build his own state-of-the-art cricket stadium 40 miles outside L.A. The $30 million venture is being spearheaded by Major League Cricket and designed by award-winning architecture firm HKS. \n\n\tHistorically, the bat and ball sport has struggled to develop a fan base outside of India, South Africa, Australia, and the U.K. However, deep-pocketed investors are willing to put an impressive $120 million into the U.S. league to expand its profile in America, Bloomberg reported. \n\n\tOf course, with this kind of financial backing, cricketers from across the globe want in on the action. The Texas Super Kings have since signed overseas players including Devon Conway, Dwayne Bravo, and David Miller. Veteran South African batter Faf du Plessis has also joined the team as captain, while West Indies spinner Sunil Narine leads the Los Angeles Knight Riders. \n\n\t\n\n\n\t“American sports fans want to see the best in the world,” MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport. “That’s the demand in U.S. professional sports.” \nDEC. 1-3 \u0026 6-8: Experience the greatest car models and cast your vote to crown the winner.\nGive the Gift of Luxury"

Backed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Indian Premier League franchises, and desi tech heavyweights like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the tournament is expected to create the right kind of buzz for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, 2024, to be hosted by the United States and the West Indies.\nUSA Cricket set the ball rolling for the MLC a few years back by creating Minor League Cricket, which had its inaugural season in 2021. Many of the top performers in the minor league have found spots on MLC teams.  This is the game-changing opportunity American cricket enthusiasts have been waiting for: each team has to field at least six domestic players in its playing 11.\nHowever, as an aspiring American cricketer myself, I was disappointed to see that not many truly homegrown domestic players have been selected. Noteworthy players like Rahul Jariwala and Vatsal Vaghela have been left out. Both of them received USA Cricket’s Emerging Player Scholarship but failed to make it on a team. Jariwala and Vaghela played in the Minor League tournament and made significant contributions to their teams. \nEven so, there’s much to celebrate, as the tournament is a giant leap for American cricket.\nThere are six teams across the United States:  Washington Freedom, Texas Super Kings, MI New York, LA Knight Riders, Seattle Orcas, and the San Francisco Unicorns. Among these teams, the Texas Super Kings, MI New York, and the LA Knight Riders are owned by IPL franchises. The IPL is the world’s second-richest sports league, bested only by the NFL. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tu003cbru003e\t\t\t\nWhile the games this season will be split between Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park, in Morrisville, North Carolina, each team is expected to have its own home stadium in the future. \nThere will be 19 group-stage matches, and the top four teams will make it to the playoffs. Much like the IPL format, the top teams will play an eliminator, qualifier, challenger, and then the final match to decide the winner of the tournament. \nFaf du Plessis (Captain), Milind Kumar, Sami Aslam, Cody Chetty, Saiteja Mukkamalla, David Miller, Devon Conway, Calvin Savage, Zia Shahzad, Dwayne Bravo, Daniel Sams, Mitchell Santner, Lahiru Milantha, Rusty Theron, Cameron Stevenson, Gerald Coetzee\nTSK has put together a good team, with many former and current IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings players. \nBatting: They have one of the strongest opening partnerships, with Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway. David Miller, a phenomenal finisher who is in amazing form is also on the roster.\nBowling: On the bowling front, they have a few bowling all-rounders, such as Rusty Theron, Cameron Stevenson, and Calvin Savage. They also have CSK’s own Dwayne Bravo, and the young Gerald Coetzee. \nDomestic talent: With their U19 selection in the draft, they picked Saiteja Mukkamalla. He is a great player, and has wonderful technique and timing, but might struggle with his strike rate. They also have Milind Kumar and Lahiru Milantha, who are both good domestic batters. \nWeak link: One area that might be lacking is their spin bowling department. Besides Mitchell Santner, they only have Zia Shahzad, a wrist spinner. \nX-factor: Daniel Sams. Sams is a good fast bowler, and can also bat. TSK will be hoping that he can execute both of these abilities. \nKieron Pollard (Captain), Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Tim David, David Wiese, Dewald Brevis, Monank Patel, Saideep Ganesh, Nicholas Pooran, Kyle Philip, Ehsan Adil, Nosthush Kenjige, Sarbjit Ladda, Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Jason Behrendorff, Rashid Khan\nMI New York has a star-studded team. \nBatting: This team has some of the best finishers in world cricket in Nicholas Pooran, Tim David, and Kieron Pollard. \nBowling: An amazing fast bowling lineup that includes Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult, and Jason Behrendorff. They also have Rashid Khan, the best spinner in international cricket. \nDomestic Talent:  They have the USA captain, Monank Patel, and Steven Taylor, who is arguably the best batter on Team USA and an aggressive left-hander. \nWeak Link: Their top order – they will have to rely on their domestic players to perform. \nX-factor: Twenty-year-old Dewald Brevis Brevis has been nicknamed Baby AB for his 360-degree shots. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWayne Parnell (Captain), Shehan Jayasuriya, Aaron Jones, Nauman Anwar, Angelo Perera, Harmeet Singh, Shubham Ranjane, Cameron Gannon, Mitchell Marsh, Dasun Shanaka, Sikandar Raza, Quinton de Kock, Phani Simhadri, Matthew Tromp,  Andrew Tye\nThe Orcas have built a very balanced team. \nBatting: Their overseas talent includes Quinton de Kock and Mitchell Marsh, both of whom are among the most powerful players in world cricket. Sri Lankan captain, Dasun Shanaka, brings his vast experience to the Orcas. Sikandar Raza picked up the 4th highest number of wickets and scored the 5th highest number of runs in the 2022 T20 World Cup. \nBowling: Marsh, Shanaka, and Raza, are all batters with terrific bowling talent, giving the Orcas a good amount of flexibility. \nDomestic Talent: Shehan Jayasuriya and Aaron Jones are both US domestic batters with international experience. \nWeak Link: They don’t have enough specialist bowlers, which might hold them back.  \nX-factor: Shehan Jayasuriya. The Orcas will be hoping that Jayasuriya will bring his excellent form in Minor League Cricket to MCL this season.\nAaron Finch (Captain), Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, Qais Ahmed, Finn Allen, Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Lungi Ngidi, Corey Anderson, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Brody Couch, Sanjay Krishnamurti, Carmi Leroux, Smit Patel, Liam Plunkett, Tajinder Singh, David White\nThe Unicorns went for veteran players in the draft. \nBatting: With their overseas selections, they chose to build a strong top order, with Aaron Finch, Matthew Wade, and Marcus Stoinis. \nBowling: The Unicorns have a strong bowling attack, including Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Lungi Ngidi, and Qais Ahmed. Veteran Liam Plunkett joins them as well. \nDomestic Players: With their U19 selection, the Unicorns picked  Sanjay Krishnamurti, who bowls left-arm orthodox, and can also bat. \nWeak Link: The team lacks finishers. They might have to shuffle their batting order around to use either Stoinis or Wade as a finishing option. \nX-factor: Corey Anderson. At the peak of his powers, Anderson was a scary batter, and a good bowler. If Anderson can return to form, the Unicorns will be an improved team. \n Sunil Narine (Captain), Jaskaran Malhotra, Jason Roy, Martin Guptill, Nitish Kumar, Rilee Rossouw, Saif Badar, Unmukt Chand, Ali Sheikh, Andre Russell, Bhaskar Yadram, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Adam Zampa, Ali Khan, Corne Dry, Lockie Ferguson\nThe Knights signed many Kolkata Knight Riders players, including Andre Russell, and Sunil Narine. \nBatting: The Knights team has a very strong batting attack, with plenty of options at their disposal. The ones to look out for are Jason Roy, Martin Guptill (New Zealand), and Rilee Rossouw from South Africa. \nBowling: Lockie Ferguson is a threatening pacer, and is currently one of the fastest in the world. Adam Zampa is a fantastic spinner. \nDomestic talent: Ali Khan and Shadley van Schalkwyk are both fast bowlers with experience playing against top-tier talent. \nX-factor: Ali Sheikh. This is one of my favorite picks. He has been on selectors’ radars for a while now and was the earliest U19 selection in the draft. Sheikh has huge potential and is the best homegrown player from the US. In U19 cricket, he scored a century in 60 balls and piled up a ton of runs in youth cricket. He can also bowl a handy left-arm orthodox, which should be helpful for the Knight Riders. \nMoises Henriques (Captain), Mukhtar Ahmed, Saad Ali, Sujith Gowda, Jacobus Pienaar, Justin Dill, Anrich Nortje, Saurabh Netravalkar, Dane Piedt, Marco Jansen, Akhilesh Bodugum, Adam Milne, Ben Dwarshuis, Akeal Hosein, Andries Gous, Glenn Phillips, Josh Philippe\nBatting: The team has some fearless players such as Glenn Phillips. Josh Philippe, an opening batsman-keeper, has scored many runs in Australia’s Big Bash League. Moises Henriques is also a powerful addition to their team. \nBowling: The Washington Freedom has some of the fastest bowlers currently in world cricket. Anrich Nortje, Adam Milne, and Marco Jansen can hit speeds as high as 155 kilometers per hour. Akeal Hosein heads their spinners. Hosein is a crafty bowler and does not give away too many runs. \nDomestic players: Their most notable picks were Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar. Gous is an attacking batter and has played in overseas leagues such as the Abu Dhabi T20 competition. Netravalkar is a left-arm pacer who gets awesome swings when he bowls with the new ball. \nWeak link: Spin bowling. Other than Akeal Hosein, the only player with real international experience is Dane Piedt. \nX-factor: Saurabh Netravalkar. Netravalkar has shown that he can stand up to top talent. \nChampion: MI New York\nWho’s your favorite team?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdi Anand is a 10th grader living in the Bay Area.

  "body": "Cricket is making its big splash in the United States, with Major League Cricket set to play its first match this week. Sanjay Govil, Washington Freedom Owner \u0026 Executive Chairman of Infinite Computer Systems, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the league and the sport's popularity in the United States and abroad.\n- Professional cricket is coming to the United States. The inaugural match for Major League Cricket, it's set to air today. The league, which was initially meant to debut in 2021, was shut down due to the COVID pandemic. It's now coming back for its first season. Hosted out of stadiums in Texas and North Carolina, Major League Cricket will span 18 days, have 19 matches, and will show the best of the best from six different professional cricket teams.\nWe're joined by someone who believes cricket will crack into the US audience. That is Washington Freedom owner, that's one of the new teams, as well as founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Systems, Sanjay Govil. Thank you so much for being here, Sanjay. It's pretty cool, it's not every day that you see a new sport and a new professional league come to fruition.\nSo how did this happen? How did the league come together? How did you get involved?\nSANJAY GOVIL: So obviously, first of all, thank you so much for having us and promoting cricket in the US. We are very excited. We have been at this for many, many years. US does have a history of cricket. There used to be a Philadelphia Cricket Club in the 1800s when cricket was semi-popular in the US.\nAnd for the last 15, 20 years, there have been a lot of cities and leagues where cricket is actually played. And this was the time when we felt that we have an opportunity for a Major League Cricket league and to have the Washington freedom team based right here in Washington DC.\n- And so when we think about the makeup of this league and what's going to make it successful, what does the first season, two seasons, what do you believe that that has to hold? What does that have to entail in order for it to get off to a booming start?\nSANJAY GOVIL: I think awareness. Being on Yahoo Finance today, that's one step towards that. There's already a lot of buzz which is being created. Most of our matches, if not all, are sold out, considering the fact that we only got going in terms of ticket sales about a month back. So there's a lot of excitement, a lot of buzz, and it's leading to a numerous things. Next year, the World Cup is happening. The T20 World Cup. US is one of the home grounds for that. And then 2028 Olympics, hopefully cricket will become part of that.\nSo there's just a lot of excitement, and our goal is to create that buzz, create what people want, give a product bring world class stars. And also the most important thing is to promote US cricket.\n- And as we talked about, for now, the teams are going to be playing in just a couple of locations. If people are not there, how can they watch these cricket matches? How is the sort of airing rights worked out?\nSANJAY GOVIL: Sure. So in the US, we are telecasting on Willow TV and also on CBS. A few games are coming on CBS. And then we have media partners across the world. So we're going to have a substantial number of people watching. 2.5 billion people who watch cricket or big fans of cricket across the world. Second most popular sport in the world after soccer.\nSo we see a huge opportunity, and we see a lot of passion already happening in terms of cricket.\n- So that's really interesting, Sanjay. So you're expecting not just to benefit from people who are cricket fans in the US, but globally who are interested in this league. Are you drawing on the people who are playing in these leagues? Are they also members of cricket teams across the globe?\nSANJAY GOVIL: Absolutely. I would say most of them have played or are playing for their countries today. And not only that, we have players who have played in the Indian Premier League and other leagues across the world. So these are really, really household names who we have here in the US.\nSo we are very honored and privileged that in our very first year, we have the quality of players who have come. And we are really, really excited to see that. And the American audience is really, really excited to see those players play, because we only see them on TV or if we have gone to countries where they are playing. But now to have them come to the US and play here is really a big thing for us.\n- Talk to us about the fan experience. I mean, when people go to a sporting event, they want to be close to the players, they want to have that access into them, they want to be able to watch them from wherever as well if they can't go to the match. So what does that fan experience look like?\nSANJAY GOVIL: That's a very good question. So we are actually building a stadium at George Mason University. And just to answer the previous question in terms of where they can watch, right now is Dallas and Morrisville which is near Raleigh, but we are building stadiums across the country. DC is going to have a stadium in the George Mason University Campus. George Mason is the biggest university, public university in Virginia.\nAnd the fan experience is going to be all around what we as Americans enjoy, which is fast-paced. No more than three hours, go in there, have our hot dogs, hamburgers, beer. Cheer the teams, have a good time. And family-oriented and kids-oriented. So that's the kind of experience we want to have around our matches.\n- I noticed that when I look at the owners here, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft has another-- his team is called the Seattle Orcas. Cricket is huge in India and obviously, you guys are Indian-Americans. And so has a huge cultural importance there as well. How do you sort of broaden the appeal? I mean, you're talking about it in American terms, as a sport, it has the same appeal as a baseball or some other sports like that. So how do you sort of broaden that appeal?\nSANJAY GOVIL: We broaden them by making them more aware. I mean, whenever I talk to people who have grown up here, the good news is that they've all heard of cricket, which is great. And there's been a lot of cross connects between the US and cricket-playing countries. There's a big immigrant population, which has actually come here. Their children go to elementary schools, junior school, high schools, colleges, universities. They talk to their friends about cricket. So cricket is a known thing.\nThe stigma which cricket had was, oh, my God, it's five days long, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But there's a shorter version, which is the three-hour version, which we are playing here now. So we just have to expand on that.\nPickleball, for example, has really caught on just in a matter of two or three years. And we feel that we have a very good product, and we feel that we can really expand the reach of what we have.\n- Wow, cricket, the next pickleball. We'll see.

Here’s how it works.\nStates' first franchise T20 cricket league is a star-studded affair\nLooking for a free Major League Cricket live stream? Every game is streaming for FREE on Jio Cinema in India. If you're an Indian away from home you can use a VPN to unblock the free stream from anywhere. MLC is on Kayo Sports in Australia, and Willow TV in the US. Full details on how to watch Major League Cricket live, wherever you are, just below. The inaugural Major League Cricket season is now underway!\nThe United States officially has its first professional franchise T20 cricket competition and, of course, it had to be called Major League Cricket. Whether or not it succeeds, it's an undeniably intriguing development, and MLC has recruited aggressively, luring in big names such as Quinton de Kock, Jason Roy and Wanindu Hasaranga with lucrative contracts.\nThe inaugural MLC season features six teams, four of which are owned or part-owned by IPL franchises. Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York and Texas Super Kings are all self-evident, then there's the Delhi Capitals-affiliated Seattle Orcas. San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom are the two outliers.\nEach team will face off once, after which the top four will qualify for the playoffs. The top two seeds will play a Qualifier, with the winner booking a spot in the MLC final on July 31. The second seed will then play the winner of the Eliminator between the third and fourth seeds.\nWith Anrich Nortje, Martin Guptill, Aaron Finch and Trent Boult also involved, the MLC certainly isn't short of star-power. The feeling is that it's come at the near-total expense of local talent, with only seven US-born players being selected at the Major League Cricket draft in March.\nAll games will be played at either Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas, or Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. Read on, then, as we explain how to watch a Major League Cricket live stream online from wherever you are, including for FREE.\n\nIn India, Major League Cricket is being televised on Sports18, but every game is being shown for free on the JioCinema app.\nIn addition to the JioCinema app, you'll need an Indian phone number in order to sign up.\nCoverage is available in Hindi, English, Malayalam, Bengali and Tamil, while the JioCinema app is compatible with Chromecast, so you can get a big-screen experience.\nAnyone outside of India who wants to watch their home MLC coverage can just pick up a good VPN and follow the instructions above to safely live stream the action. \nBelow we've got you covered with your official broadcasting options for more cricket-loving countries (and the US!), but if you're outside your country of residence - whether that's India, Australia or anywhere else - and try to start streaming Major League Cricket via your typical broadcasting service, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.\nBy downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.\nUse a VPN to watch Major League Cricket from anywhere:\nExpressVPN is the world's top VPN right now\nWe've taken the time to try out all the biggest VPN providers and we found ExpressVPN to be the pick of the bunch. It works with lots of devices and offers super fast connections across its many servers. \nThrow in its robust set of security features and ExpressVPN is the best all-round VPN for streaming - and perhaps best of all, it has a 30-day money back guarantee plus 3 months FREE when you subscribe for a year.\nAccess ExpressVPN via your laptop, iPhone, tablet, Android phone, PlayStation, Xbox and plenty more. Express is a do-it-all service that also benefits from 24/7 customer support.\n- Try ExpressVPN 100% risk-free for 30 days\n\nThe inaugural Major League Cricket season is being shown exclusively on streaming service Willow TV in the US and Canada.\nWillow TV is available from a number of cable providers including Dish, Spectrum, Xfinity, Verizon Fios and more. \nNot got cable? No worries, as Willow TV is also accessible via OTT provider Sling TV across a range of devices. There are options to pay just for Willow (from $7 a month), or add it to your existing Sling plan. You can check out your options and sign up on its website.\n\nCricket fans Down Under can watch Major League Cricket on Fox Sports or Kayo Sports.\nYou'll need to pay to watch on Fox Sports, which is available via a Foxtel subscription, but the tournament will also be shown on the terrific sports streaming service Kayo Sports, which is the ideal option for those who don't want the commitment of a lengthy (and pricey) contract.\nKayo lets you stream on one device with its One plan (AU$25/month), two devices with Basic (AU$30/month), and three devices Premium (AU$35 a month). All three plans come with a FREE 7-day trial.\nIt also gives you access to over 50 other sports including NRL, NHL, NBA, F1... the list goes on! Handy if you don't want to go all out on Fox.\nOutside Australia right now? You can take your cricket coverage abroad with you as well. For those wanting to watch home coverage of sports from overseas, make sure you subscribe to the best VPN available.\n\nAt the time of writing, it isn't clear if you'll be able to watch Major League Cricket in the UK. However, with it a brand new competition, that could change in the coming days – we'll keep our eyes peeled!\nOne possibility we're alert to is MLC games streaming for free on the MLC Network YouTube channel. We're not holding our breath, but it's where the MLC Draft was shown, and the league will surely want to attract as many eyeballs as possible.\n\nSign up to receive daily breaking news, reviews, opinion, analysis, deals and more from the world of tech.\nAatif is a freelance copywriter and journalist based in the UK.

  "body": "After soccer and baseball, cricket fans in the United States now have a ‘Major League’ to tune in to as well. The Major League Cricket is the newest addition to the list of franchise cricket leagues around the globe. With several big names from the world of cricket taking part in the tournament that is characterised by its glamorous outlook (as is the case with all other franchise-based cricket leagues), the Major League Cricket 2023 has turned several eyeballs in its direction.\nIn a bid to increase the popularity of cricket as a sport in the United States, the plan to start a franchise-based league has been in the pipeline since 2018. Now, after five years and a development league (the Minor League Cricket in 2021), the MLC is finally in motion. Sanctioned by the USA Cricket, the country’s apex cricket governing body, and organised by the American Cricket Enterprises, the start of the MLC was deferred from 2021 to 2023 owing to the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs the Major League Cricket enters its business end for the 2023 season, we deep dive into the tournament’s details that you should know about― the structure of the tournament, the teams participating in it, the owners of the respective teams and more.\nAfter USA Cricket was appointed as the apex governing body of cricket in the United States in January 2019, replacing the old USACA, it accepted a bid of USD 1 billion by American Cricket Enterprises for covering the proposed MLC and other investments beneficial for the national cricket team. The ACE’s partners include the likes of Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain of The Times Group, alongside Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan who are founders of Willow TV.\nIn 2022, MLC acquired around USD 120 million in its first fundraising round. Investors in the MLC include Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella, American businessman Ross Perot Jr, entrepreneur Anand Rajaraman and former CEO of Adobe Shantanu Narayen, among others.\nThe MLC mirrors the format of the top franchise-based cricket leagues across the globe, with every team facing each other in the league stage followed by a knockout phase in which the top four teams from the league stage compete.\nFor the knockout phase, the MLC has adopted the playoffs format used in the Indian Premier League. In this format, the top two teams face off in the Qualifier, the winner of which gets direct entry into the Final of the tournament. The third and fourth-ranked teams from the league stage face each other in the Eliminator. The loser of the Eliminator gets knocked out of the tournament, while the victor moves on to play against the loser of the Qualifier in the Challenger. The team winning in the Challenger moves on to the Final to battle against the winner of the Qualifier for the title.\nYes, American Cricket Enterprises has set a salary cap for players taking part in the Major League Cricket. According to reports, each team has a salary cap of USD 1.15 million.\nIn the inaugural 2023 season, six teams are taking part in the MLC. The teams, along with their respective home cities, owners and captains for 2023 are as follows:\n \n \nA post shared by Los Angeles Knight Riders (@lakriders)\n\nBased out of California’s Irvine, the Los Angeles Knight Riders is owned by the Knight Riders Group, which has Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan as a co-owner. The Knight Riders group also owns teams in other franchise-based cricket leagues, the most notable of which are the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, the Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League and the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the International League T20. In the inaugural season of the MLC, the spinner from West Indies, Sunil Narine, took up the mantle of captaincy for the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n \n \nA post shared by MI New York (@minycricket)\n\nIndiawin Sports, owner of several teams in franchise-based cricket leagues around the world, is the owner of MI New York. The parent group, a subsidiary of the Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries, is also the owner of the Mumbai Indians, one of the most successful teams in the IPL. With their base in New York’s Brooklyn, the MI New York, in MLC 2023, have modern-day West Indian legend and veteran all-rounder Kieron Pollard wearing the captain’s hat.\n \n \nA post shared by San Francisco Unicorns (@sfounicorns)\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns, based out of San Jose, California, are owned by entrepreneurs Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan. Former Australian international cricketer Aaron Finch, who led the Australian team to their maiden ICC Men’s T20 World Cup win in 2021, was the captain for the inaugural season of MLC in 2023.\n \n \nA post shared by Seattle (@mlcseattleorcas)\n\nThe franchise team from Redmond, Washington is jointly owned by the GMR Group and Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella. Of their several business ventures, the GMR Group’s sports division is the owner of the IPL team Delhi Capitals (formerly known as Delhi Daredevils). In Major League Cricket 2023, the Seattle Orcas side is captained by South African cricketer Wayne Parnell.\n \n \nA post shared by Texas Super Kings (@texassuperkings)\n\nChennai Super Kings, one of the most successful teams, not just in the IPL, but also in the world of franchise-based cricket leagues, is the owner of the Texas Super Kings alongside Ross Perot Jr and Anurag Jain. Hailing from Grand Prairie, the Texan outfit, in the inaugural season of MLC, is being captained by veteran South African cricketer Faf Du Plessis.\n \n \nA post shared by Glenn Phillips (@glennphillips236)\n\nBased out of Washington DC, the Washington Freedom team is owned by Sanjay Govil, a prominent entrepreneur. In Major League Cricket 2023, Australian all-rounder Moises Henriques led the team.\nAmerican Cricket Enterprises has plans to expand the tournament in the future and have ten teams participate in the league instead of six. It is also planning to help build stadiums for each of the franchises in their respective bases.\nThe Major League Cricket 2023 started on July 13. The league stage of the tournament concluded on July 25, following which the playoffs started on July 27. The final is scheduled to be played on July 30.\n \n \nA post shared by Los Angeles Knight Riders (@lakriders)\n\nIn 2023, the matches for the Major League Cricket are being played at two stadiums. While the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, North Texas is hosting 12 matches, the Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina has been entrusted with the responsibility of hosting seven matches.\nBeing a franchise-based cricket league with several wealthy investors in its portfolio, the Major League Cricket is bound to be among the richest cricketing tournaments in the world.

  "body": "Filed under:\nMLC is selling out matches, turning heads, and bringing the party.\nNestled in Raleigh-Durham’s Research Triangle, the national hub of science and technological research, thousands of transplanted cricket fans get the taste of home they’ve been missing. Adorned in the jerseys of their favorite Indian Premier League teams and carrying the flags of their home nations — 3,000 pack into the newly-constructed Morrisville Cricket Ground to see the final Major League Cricket (MLC) game in North Carolina, before the league heads back to Texas to close out the season.\nFrom knowledgeable die-hard fans, to those new to the game, young and old alike, there’s one prevailing sentiment sweeping the grounds: Cricket in the United States is going to work.\nMLC is finishing up its inaugural season, and Tuesday night saw the league-leading Seattle Orcas take on MI New York in an absolute nail-biting game which saw the Orcas pull out a win with four balls remaining in their innings, thanks largely to masterful batting from South African international Heinrich Klaasen, who finished the match with 110 runs, scoring the first century in league history in the process.\nThe result of this one game was far less important than what Tuesday night represented: Five games in Morrisville, five straight sellouts, matching the runaway success that MLC has had in Texas, where games have been selling out an even larger cricket ground in Grand Prairie (a suburb of Dallas) since the league began two weeks ago.\nThis season was designed as a proof of concept, and that concept has been proven. The appetite for cricket is alive, and the sky is the limit. Intentionally targeting markets with large South Asian populations, Major League Cricket has already won a cult following of Indian, Pakistani and Afghan fans — relishing the opportunity to see some of the best players from cricket’s past and present play in their new backyard. \nTuesday night also gave way to tremendous emotion, as Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan, now playing for MI New York was swarmed by fans at the fence while fielding. Predominantly teenagers and children, the majority of whom are refugees who found asylum in the United States. They had a rare chance to see a national sporting hero in their new home — and it clearly affected Khan, who did his best to continue playing while signing autographs for the legion of supporters chanting his name.\nMLC has managed to capture the party-like atmosphere of T20 cricket. The ground was a festival of color and sound, mashing together traditional cricket culture and a new environment. The PA system alternated between playing Indian pop songs and western Top-40 hits, whistles and horns droned through the crowd after ever big shot, and fans were encouraged to bring their own coolers of food and drink to fight back the heat. This league isn’t a cash grab, but a celebration of cricket and a love letter to the game.\nMajor League Cricket is already achieving something most sporting league dream of: Attracting young fans. At least 80 percent of those in attendance were 35-years-old or younger, with a majority of children and teenagers in attendance. Sure, one might chalk that up to being dragged to the game by their parents — but every fan in attendance was engaged, cheering, and excited to be a part of something that felt big, special, and on the verge of truly breaking out.\nArjun, a native of Mumbai now living in the Triangle, brought his wife and two young children to experience the game. “Cricket was a part of my childhood,” he says “now I want it to be a part of theirs.” \nThe next step is outreach and education. The league can certainly survive on a migrant population alone, but to thrive it will require transcending traditional cricket fans and capturing Americans who don’t know the game. To this end T20 is the perfect onboarding process, allowing games to last 3-4 hours, in a format which rewards big risks, huge hits, and plenty of excitement.\nThat’s no easy feat, but as the sport grows the FOMO of the next big thing in sports will set in. Especially as stadiums keep selling out and word of mouth travels about just how much fun cricket can be. Nobody left the grounds on Tuesday night thinking it was just “okay,” but rather even non-traditional fans seeing their first match raved about how incredible the experience was.\n“I was dragged here by my British coworker,” says Tyler, a software engineer from Raleigh. “I’ve heard of cricket before, but never seen it. This was incredible. Everyone would love this.” Tyler admits he didn’t always understand what he was watching, but he’s already hooked, “I’m definitely going to learn the rules and come back next year.” \nIt’s been over 20 years since I saw a cricket match in person. The 2002-03 Ashes 5th test between Australia and England was the final sporting event I saw back home before moving to the United States for college. Never in my wildest dreams did I think cricket would follow me to NC, but here I was, in 92-degree heat, with a smile plastered on my face for hours on end. I wasn’t the only one, because Morrisville has caught cricket fever — and it’s only going to spread.\nMajor League Cricket isn’t just here as a curiosity, it’s truly arrived. \n\n\nGAMBLING PROBLEM?

  "body": "“Imagine,” my friend said, in an attempt to contextualize the ocean of flags, whistles, drums, and overall frenzy surrounding us last night in Grand Prairie, “that you’re way into basketball—and your country just got basketball.”\nOn a basic level, he was describing the biggest selling point of Major League Cricket, whose attempt to bring the world’s second-most popular sport to the United States—and North Texas, in particular—is the subject of my feature in our July issue. North Texas has one of the largest South Asian populations in the United States, and that community is cricket-rabid, with no significant outlet on this side of the Atlantic aside from the Caribbean. What happens when you provide one?\nThe answer, as we saw last night, is a sellout crowd of more than 7,000 people losing their minds for the better part of four hours as the Texas Super Kings (our new local team) took on Mumbai Indians New York. Our D Magazine contingent—Tim Rogers, Matt Goodman, Brian Reinhart, and yours truly—pegged the crowd to be well over 90 percent South Asian, which is in the ballpark of what every source I spoke with told me represents the national fan base. Per an MLC press release from over the weekend, six matches in the first 10 days reached capacity. A bunch of rich guys are building a cricket league with actual infrastructure, and now everyone is showing up.\nBut it would also be reductive, and unfair, to describe MLC’s appeal in relation to one group of people. Not everyone in the crowd was South Asian, after all. Take, for instance, the four of us. Tim, Matt, and Brian knew next to nothing about cricket going into last night. (Brian was there for the concessions, which he’ll write about soon enough.) Prior to reporting this story, I was in the same boat—and when it comes to understanding the action itself, still kinda sorta am. And we had a hell of a Monday night.\nSome of this is due to the sport itself, which is faster, more vibrant, and, frankly, more dangerous than most people realize. But the experience in the stands is what stood out to me. It would be naïve to characterize any pro sporting event as organic—those that are tend to do poorly in the profit margins—but it was largely a blissful escape from the prepackaging that contaminates American sports. There were no promotions or sponsorships jammed into each break in the action. The video board stuck to stats and the occasional, too-infrequent replay. The PA announcer chimed in for names, lineups, key points in the match … and that’s about it. It won’t last forever—sports are big business—but in the here and now, MLC seems to understand the allure of a great sport and a great atmosphere.\nThose two things transcend demographics. They’re why sports remain our most durable culturally unifying force. Yes, the South Asians who understand cricket and its rhythms set the tone of the crowd last night. But it didn’t take long for Matt to start blasting his canary-yellow Super Kings whistle. Or Tim to make excuses for his new sports hero, Texas captain Faf du Plessis, after an error at bat. Or all four of us to nod in approval at hard-earned runs and clap our hands at fours (when the ball rolls to the wall) and spring to our feet as fireworks exploded with each six (cricket’s version of a home run).\nThis was a blending of East and West, old fans and new. Concession stands offered samosas and burgers. The DJ blasted Hindi music and Kesha. Seasoned cricket watchers in the row ahead of us periodically turned to gently explain nuances of the game that we were too green to see.\nAnd so we learned. We laughed. We celebrated. We chowed down. And thanks to a new (to us) sport put on by a new (to everyone) league, we had a wonderful night.\nBy the way, the Super Kings won 154-137.\nAttractions\nBars and Clubs\nShops\nRestaurants\n\n750 North St.Paul St.\nSuite 2100\nDallas, Texas 75201\n\n\nTel: 214.939.3636\n \nFax: 214.748.4579\n"

San Francisco Unicorns is owned by Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, co-founders of Cambrian ventures.\n Texas Super Kings are co-owned by the Chennai Super Kings, Ross Perot Jr., and Anurag Jain; while Washington Freedom team is owned by Indian American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil.\n \"It's not only the Indian diaspora that is very excited, those from Australia, United Kingdom, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand are also excited about the start of the Major League Cricket in the United States,\" said an avid cricket fan, M R Rangaswami from San Francisco, who is flying to Dallas to watch the opening match.\n Star players set to take part include Afghanistan T20 captain Rashid Khan, South African internationals Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and David Miller, West Indians Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell and Dwayne Bravo, Australians Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch, England's Jason Roy and Liam Plunkett, Sri Lankan Dasun Shanaka and New Zealand's Trent Boult.\n Players have been drafted mainly from all major cricket playing nations except for India, because of the existing rules of the BCCI.\n \"The US media market is the largest in the world. So, at some point, they'll realise that sending these (Indian) players is good for everybody,\" Rangaswami told PTI.\n Ahead of the start of the games, Sameer Mehta, co-founder of Major League Cricket said fans will experience an unforgettable night for cricket in America, with a full house welcoming the world's top players to Grand Prairie Stadium for the opening match.\n \"Since we arrived in Texas, it's been incredible to see the support for the Texas Super Kings.\n \"We can't wait to get out on the field at Grand Prairie Stadium and represent the Lone Star State in front of a full house and be part of a special night for cricket in America,\" said Faf du Plessis, captain of the Texas Super Kings.\n \"It's going to be a historic night at Grand Prairie Stadium, as the first ever Major League Cricket game unfolds in front of a packed stadium this Thursday night. I've always spoken about wanting to represent the Knight Riders wherever they play.\n \"We've long talked about coming to the United States and I'm glad it's finally happening.\n \"It's great to hear that the opening game has been sold out, and we can't wait to bring our exciting brand of cricket to the cricket fans in America.\" said Sunil Narine, captain of the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n Anurag Jain, co-owner of the MLC Texas Super Kings Cricket, said, \"We look forward to having a professional team in Texas for the passionate local cricket community to root for and to introduce the sport to new fans across the country. \n\nCOMMents\n\n SHARE\n\n\ncricket\n\nBACK TO TOP\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

A warm breeze blew across the ground but there was barely a cloud in the sky or a patch of green on the wicket. Ideal batting conditions, all told.\nNot that Khan – opening for the LA Knight Riders – would have thrown the ball to anyone else. This was a moment to cherish for the USA star. He was tasked with bowling the first ball of Major League Cricket: this country's newest professional sports league and this sport's latest attempt to break America.\n'A giant leap across the Atlantic,' broadcasters called it. 'Cricket's American dream'.\nNo pressure, then. And so Devon Conway – of New Zealand and the Texas Super Kings – waited as Khan sent the ball into the pitch and towards the unknown.\nThe fast bowler believes that, in time, this T20 tournament will trail only the Indian Premier League.\nThe Texas Super Kings ran out winners in the first game of Major League Cricket on Thursday\nThousands of adoring fans turned up for a successful first night in Grand Prairie, Texas\nIt remains to be seen whether Major League Cricket can keep up the hype they've built so far\nThe next two and half weeks should tell us if he is on to something. Or seduced by blind faith.\nThis was the first of 19 games split between this converted baseball ground near Dallas and a 3,000-seater stadium in North Carolina.\nDeep pockets and grand plans mean top international talent is spread across the six teams – the Knight Riders, the Super Kings, the Seattle Orcas, the San Francisco Unicorns, Washington Freedom and MI New York. Jason Roy gave up his England contract to come over. Liam Plunkett is here, too. \nAlso among the foreign legion are South Africa's Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada, Australia's Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa and Aaron Finch and West Indians Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell. \nThey will line up alongside local talent such as Pakistan-born Khan. Around 6,000 fans flocked here on Thursday night, including Sri Lanka legend Mahela Jayawardene. Organizers reckon they could have flogged a few thousand more. \nBut it was a sell-out and a terrific atmosphere. 'T-S-K, T-S-K' rang out even before half centuries from Conway and David Miller fired the Super Kings to 181/6. In response, South African-American Rusty Theron helped reduce the Knight Riders to 7-3.\nRussell led a fightback, hitting 10 boundaries and sending one out of the stadium. It was all in vain as the Super Kings won by 69 runs to send yellow flags waving into the Texas sky, and crown an opening night flush with promise.\nAmerica's Ali Khan (left) was given the huge moment of bowling the first ball of the league \nDavid Miller plays a shot from Khan during Major League Cricket's opener, in 100 degree heat\nFans watch on as Milind Kumar stops the ball at the boundary during the game on Thursday\nBack in March, when Major League Cricket gathered for its swanky draft four hours south of here, the symbolism was obvious. They chose the NASA space center in Houston for a reason. But will the next fortnight really mark lift-off for cricket on this vast frontier. Or just another false dawn? Another of what Elon Musk might term a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'.\nBecause we have been here before. Recent decades have seen several botched attempts to break America. The first incarnation of Major League Cricket – founded in 2000 – barely got off the ground.\nNo wonder organizers of this venture admit to having doubts.\nBut they have at least given themselves solid foundations. As well as an impressive cast of imports, Major League Cricket have enlisted some serious backers - both financial and cricketing. \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is among several Silicon Valley types pumping in money, while IPL owners have stakes in four of the six teams. The other two are supported by Australian state bodies.\nThose close ties could lure stars such as Australian Steve Smith over in the future.\nBut organizers can't afford this to become just another T20 Tournament in an already crammed field. They know that the cricket must sell itself. And they know they have to lean on their surroundings.\nHence the pre-game pageantry and aerial acrobatics: they want to combine American glitz with cricketing guile.\nOn Thursday night, though, Grand Prairie was laced with South Asian flavor.\nFans were given a free flag and whistle on entry. Some wore Stetsons. Many more wore shirts carrying the names of IPL teams and Indian stars such as MS Dhoni. Stalls around the ground, meanwhile, were supplied by Foodistaan, a local Indian restaurant.\nUnmukt Chand can only watch on as fans try to catch a ball hit for six by the Texas Super Kings\nThere was a party atmosphere, and Major League Cricket has deep pockets and big plans\nIndian expats offer this tournament an immediate support base and the plan was to target 'low-hanging fruit' – existing cricket fans – first. For this to last, however, for MLC to attract more overseas stars, for cricket to even dream of rubbing shoulders with baseball – America's Pastime - new fans will have to come. Preferably before next year, when the US will co-host the T20 World Cup.\nThis opening night came had its teething problems – a few loose shots and dropped catches and a half-time drone show that fell victim to technical glitches.\nBut it ended with fireworks, after Miller, Russell and Co had provided plenty of pyrotechnics.\nNow we wait. To see if cricket lights up America at last, or fizzles into the dark once more.\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday \u0026 Metro Media Group"

  "body": "The first-ever season of Major League Cricket — United States’ first ever professional T20 league sanctioned by USA Cricket — has some takeaways. More than half the games across the two host cities of Dallas and Morrisville in the lead up to the final have been in front of sold out crowds. The star cast has featured the who’s who of T20 cricket in Rashid Khan, Mitchell Marsh, Quinton de Kock, Wanindu Hasaranga, Haris Rauf and more.\nThe broadcast has aired across the country on CBS Sports, home of UEFA Champions League and the two big national love interests in National Football League (NFL) and National Basketball League (NBA). This, with an initial investment pot of over $120 million with investors that include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. And not to forget, the Minor League Cricket (MiLC), which was launched in 2021 as a developmental league to the MLC with 26 teams of its own and a budget upwards of $5 million.\n“What we’re doing here is really transforming the landscape of the sport and giving it a platform to succeed,” Tom Dunmore, Vice President of Marketing at MLC, tells The Indian Express. “It’s not just grafting on the franchise structure and bringing in players, it’s the whole foundation of the sport. Stadium, practice facilities, coaches, the expertise in groundskeeping, preparing a wicket properly, all those things that the USA hasn’t had a rich tradition of in recent years because it is difficult.”\n“The timelines work pretty well,” says Dunmore. A T20 World Cup is being co-hosted next summer and cricket is set to be introduced to the Olympics in Los Angeles five years down the line.\nBut will cricket really catch on in the United States? It makes sense according to the marketing guy. “I do think if you know baseball, which most Americans obviously do, you really love a bat-ball sport with a lot of the same fundamentals as cricket,” Dunmore says. “If you go to Brazil or Italy, where there isn’t a big bat and ball sport, it’s going to be harder. At least here, we can translate that a six is a home run. You’re caught out when the ball’s in the air, things like that. They take some explaining. Some terminology of cricket can be a bit arcane. Why is a wicket three different things, for example. But once you get past that, I think the Americans can adopt the game pretty quickly.”\nThe first impressions have been ‘pleasantly’ surprising. “They’re actually surprised at how much action there is up against what they actually thought of the sport. The ball is in play a lot more in cricket. There’s a lot more big hitting, a lot more scoring, a lot more home runs/sixes.”\nIt isn’t the first time that the USA has looked outside of its fantastic four – Baseball, Basketball, American Football, Hockey – to adopt a more internationally followed sport. Not the first time Dunmore has been involved in doing so as well, having worked behind the scenes in America’s soccer revolution. With Major League Soccer (MLS) well into its 28th season, it was about time for ‘world’s second most popular sport’, as it has been introduced to the uninitiated.\nCricket though, is no soccer. “It’s a tough sport, right? It’s not like soccer where you can just pop it up on any rectangular field essentially, and play. Cricket takes a lot more work to get right and do it at a high level,” Dunmore states.\n“I’ve got a history of helping grow sports or introducing sports in the US,” Dunmore tells with a chuckle, before sharing a past that connects both him and America to cricket. “I grew up a cricket fan in England. Got connected to it more when I lived in Indianapolis, which had a cricket pitch built several years ago. There were some high ambitions for em’, even the ICC hosted some events there. Indianapolis had a really good vision for it. Didn’t quite pan out in the end but I got connected to some of the cricket folks in the US at that point. And then, got the chance to help launch this (MLC).”\nWho’s playing and watching it in the States?\n“The feeling has been like playing cricket in India,” says LA Knight Riders’ Jaskaran Malhotra of his on-ground MLC experience. The Chandigarh-born USA cricketer, the first to hit six sixes in an over for the national side, isn’t far-fetched in his assessment. The two venues in the league have witnessed the local South East Asian diaspora take to the stands in large numbers. From Afghanistan flags to Sri Lanka and India jerseys. “Pakistani players don’t feature in the IPL but here we have them. The likes of Shadab (Khan) and Haris (Rauf)….the standard of cricket has been very high,” Malhotra adds.\nThere is then, the question of how the other ethnicities in the country are responding to the sport, if at all? “In my academy in Baltimore, Maryland, there are a lot of local people who are taking up the sport. White, native and African Americans,” says the USA cricketer. “My entire extended family is based out of here. They are getting warmed up to the sport. People who have stayed in America for five generations are now enjoying it.”\nIn order to ignite a fan culture, the MLC Vice President of Marketing takes to the white board, “We already have millions of cricket fans here, which is a really great base to start with. There’s a whole generation of expats from cricket loving countries, who are exposed to the sport but aren’t going to be fans of the US team unless we give them something to cheer for. And that’s the chance that we have for the first time. If you’re a fan growing up in Dallas, you can support your hometown team now in cricket. That’s not been the case before. If we can win that generation over as well as the immigrants that are already here… then it’s about converting kids that didn’t grow up with cricket. That will take a bit of trial and error but we want to solely increase the percentage of fans that didn’t grow up with cricket.”\nPACE⏩ \u0026 BOUNCE⏫!\nLiam Plunkett utilizes both in this CRAFTY wicket of the in-form, Nauman Anwar!\n5⃣3⃣/2⃣ (5.5) pic.twitter.com/iDaFgLKtwD\n— Major League Cricket (@MLCricket) July 16, 2023\nFor former England World Cup-winning pacer Liam Plunkett as well, cricket in the USA has been a familiar experience. “It has felt like a proper cricket tournament with packed crowds supporting all the sides involved,” he tells. The pacer’s LinkedIn bio speaks for itself: Starting a new adventure in the USA. Playing at Surrey Cricket Club during the fag end of his career, Plunkett was reached out by the MLC not just to play but “structure the national development coach role. Look after the players and help run the Philadelphia academy.”\nDoes he picture MLC making it to the big league status; like IPL is to cricket or NFL is to the USA? “I mean, that’s huge in America, isn’t it? NFL is like cricket in India. A religion to a lot of Americans. IPL is a different ball game altogether. If we can even climb the ladder towards that it would be amazing. But it would take a lot of time.”\nWith a World Cup and a first cricket featuring Olympics on the horizon, the land of opportunity has another.\n\n\n\t\tRahul Pandey\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eRahul Pandey is Senior Sub Editor on th... read more"

  "body": "From\n\nD Magazine\nJuly\n2023\n\n\nAs the pandemic got underway in earnest, in March 2020, Corey Anderson found himself 7,500 miles from home and a world away from the fame he’d known for much of his life. Back in Auckland, Anderson’s was a household name. He’d been a star on the New Zealand national cricket team ever since he’d set a world record for the fastest player to score 100 runs—a “century,” in cricket parlance—in a one-day match at just 21 years old. He’d spent the better part of a decade as a globe-trotting superstar, a hulking 6-foot-1, with the blond stubble and effortlessly tousled hair to pass for the Hemsworth brothers’ Kiwi cousin. He’d grown accustomed to being cheered on by tens of thousands from Mumbai to Barbados and, at his peak, pocketing more than half a million dollars for two months of work in the Indian Premier League, the world’s biggest and most lucrative franchised cricket competition. \nThen, just days before worldwide air traffic was grounded, Anderson flew from Auckland to Dallas, where his live-in American fiancée, Mary Margaret, was already visiting her mother in Highland Park. For the next nine months, he’d be cooped up in the guest room of his future mother-in-law’s house, acclimating to a life away from the game, stranded in a place where, he says, “cricket’s basically irrelevant for 99 percent of the country.”\nA part of him had been preparing for such a transition ever since he got serious with Mary Margaret, whom he’d met at a party four years earlier while on vacation in Croatia. During their courtship, he’d visited Dallas often enough to imagine a life for himself here, growing so fond of the city—the flat terrain, friendly people, and tree-lined streets reminded him of his hometown of Christchurch—that it came to feel like “home away from home.” But that was supposed to be well into the future, after his playing days ended. He’d turned 30 only a few months earlier; he imagined five, maybe six, more years of top-class cricket in front of him. And there was none of that to be found in Dallas—or anywhere else in the United States. \n“I knew in my head that I was going to move here at some point in time,” he says. “It just wasn’t yet.”\nIn the meantime, though, the borders were closed. He was stuck, with nowhere to play. So he may as well be of use. About six weeks after arriving in Dallas, he tracked down the phone number of Iain Higgins, then the chief executive of USA Cricket, and asked him two questions: what is the state of American cricket, and is there a way he could help? \nThe answer to the latter question, as it turned out, was he could. For 90 minutes, Higgins laid out a plan that, if successful, would change professional sports. As cricket surged to become the world’s second-most popular sport, the United States remained by far the largest market it had yet to penetrate, though not for lack of trying. In 2004, a domestic league called Pro Cricket lasted all of a season. A half-decade later, the American Premiere League was announced. It would take a dozen years, and the collapse of the governing body that sanctioned it, for any games to be played, at a far smaller scale than envisioned. But the national interest is there. Peter Della Penna, who covers the sport for ESPN’s English-language cricket site, says that the United States is neck and neck with the United Kingdom as the country providing the most web traffic, behind India. The domestic club scene is growing, too. One-off tournaments dot the country. But no one had ever blended fiscal might with the necessary cricket smarts to build a competition on par with the biggest franchised leagues in India, Pakistan, England, Australia, and the Caribbean.  \nUntil now. Higgins told Anderson about an investment supergroup called American Cricket Enterprises, which had formed to create Major League Cricket, a six-team professional league that intended to succeed where everyone else had failed in the States. Four of the teams are backed by Indian Premier League clubs, who transformed cricket from stuffy to spectacle at a level unmatched by anyone else. Games would be played in July, a dead spot on the global cricket schedule, as well as the most wide-open time of year on the American sports calendar. There would be world-class stadiums, youth academies, and an accompanying minor league.\nAnd, oh, there was money—$120 million to be exact, after $44 million raised from Series A and A1 rounds plus $76 million in additional investment from the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who co-owns Major League Cricket’s Seattle Orcas, and Ross Perot Jr. and Anurag Jain, who are part of the ownership group of Texas Super Kings, the North Texas franchise. More than enough to lure premium talent across the Atlantic for a few weeks per year or persuade them to relocate full time in hopes of establishing a cricket culture that would help elevate the United States into a powerhouse. Do this right, and one day Major League Cricket could bully its way into the top handful of leagues in the world.\nThat is where Anderson came in. The following night, Major League Cricket co-founder Sameer Mehta delivered a proposal. What if Anderson accelerated his plan to relocate to the United States? Doing so would come at considerable cost. It would mean renouncing his eligibility for the New Zealand national team and changing residency to the United States, a three-year process that limited the number of days he could leave the country. Anderson’s earning potential would be slashed, too, at least as long as he had no international matches to play and a smaller window to compete in franchised competitions across the globe. He’d face long odds to compete on stages smaller than the ones he’d already graced.\nBut saying yes would give him a chance to matter in a way he never could as a cricketer alone. Anderson’s record for the fastest century had fallen a year after he’d set it. He would soon be replaced on the New Zealand team. “But if this can turn into what I think it could turn into, the legacy you create is way bigger,” he says. “Leaving a footprint on the game of cricket [instead of] just being a player who played the game and left the game.”\nBest of all, Anderson was already right where he needed to be. While Major League Cricket teams will eventually play in their home cities, which also include New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., only North Texas has a stadium that would be competition-ready out of the gate. For at least the first two years, the bulk of Major League Cricket matches will be played out of the newly renamed Grand Prairie Stadium. (A portion of this year’s games will also be played in Raleigh.) So, too, will a handful of matches in the 2024 T20 World Cup, which the United States will co-host with the West Indies. Perhaps even a match or two in the 2028 Olympics, which is considering adding cricket as a sport. Major League Cricket plans to install its headquarters in Grand Prairie Stadium, where its Australian physical performance coach, Burt Cockley, already resides with the intention of working out of the high-performance center scheduled to be completed next year. Players, drawn to the cheaper cost of living, plus being at the new hub of American cricket, are following. Setting down roots in Dallas would not only amount to a ticket home for Mary Margaret, who had moved to Auckland almost three years earlier, but it would also place Anderson at the epicenter of the most audacious American sports experiment since Major League Soccer was formed in 1993. \nThe 32-year-old New Zealand native bats left-handed and once held the world record for the fastest player to score 100 runs. He was drafted by the San Francisco Unicorns.\nSo Anderson signed on—and once he did, says Cockley, “it kind of showed this thing was real.” Now, three years later, Anderson will take the field as part of the San Francisco Unicorns, who selected him fourth in the league’s inaugural domestic player draft. In August, he’ll again captain the Dallas Mustangs, one of 26 teams in Minor League Cricket. He has become one of the league’s brightest faces and trusted ambassadors, and he remains steadfast in his optimism. As Anderson recalls telling Liam Plunkett, an ex-England international he helped recruit to the league, “This is kind of like being part of a startup. Do you want to get in now? Or would you want to wait three or four years and then go, ‘Damn, this thing took off. I’m now joining a bigger crowd to try and kind of find my way’? ” \nBut startups bust far more than they boom, and that’s especially true for startup professional sports leagues. Generations of suits have tried and failed to establish lucrative counterprogramming to Major League Baseball, from arena football to rugby. And none of them faced a challenge quite like Major League Cricket’s: to yank a sport buried in the American subculture into the mainstream, while it also attempts to reorganize how the game is played at the grassroots level. \nAll the necessary capital—financial, intellectual, athletic—is in place, which only heightens the urgency. Never before has this level of investment been poured into American cricket, which might make Major League Cricket the last, best chance for the sport to hit it big in the United States.  \n“If this doesn’t work, it won’t work,” Cockley says. \nNorth Texas will be the proving ground. \nCricket is coming to North Texas​ for all the reasons you might guess. The centrally convenient location. The top-five media market. The thriving sports scene. Even the demographics. Della Penna characterizes cricket in America as “99.9 percent” Southeast Asian or West Indian expats; regional populations have ticked upward since the dot-com boom and surged over the last decade.\nBut Major League Cricket planted its flag here for one reason above all others: there was an empty shell for it to crawl into, to call home until it could, hopefully, someday, outgrow it. Consider Major League Cricket a sports-league hermit crab. \nAirHogs Stadium, across the road from Lone Star Park, has been vacant for three years. The independent-league baseball team it was named after played there from 2008 through 2020, but, toward the end, they were lucky to draw 1,700 fans in a night. After the Texas AirHogs went bust in 2020, Major League Cricket saw its opening. \nPerhaps Major League Cricket’s greatest impediment toward growing the game will be getting Americans to play it. The ideological challenge—how do we get people to care about our sport?—is no different from the struggle Major League Soccer faced 30 years ago, or the one Major League Rugby, which was founded in 2017, weathers today. Of course, cricket’s idiosyncrasies can be more complicated than those in soccer or rugby; a wicket, for instance, can refer to either the pitch the sport is played on or to a key piece of equipment on that field of play.\nLogistically, however, cricket’s plight is unique. The sport is intended to be played on dedicated turf wickets, not grass, which precludes it from sharing space with most of the courts, fields, and diamonds this country has built over generations. Unlike soccer pre-MLS, cricket isn’t played in American schools, which removes a crucial avenue for exposing young people to the sport and rules out the scholarship incentives that keep so many athletes (and their families) invested. That flattens the player base and thus the demand for school districts or parks and recreation departments to build those turf wickets where a grass field is cheaper and more widely used, to say nothing of bargaining power that nudges change along. As a result, most games around the country are played on concrete, a poor substitute for turf, given that the ball bounces more frequently and more predictably. The lack of proper turf wickets means the average American is not even playing the same sport as the rest of the world. \n“I had absolutely no idea what I was coming into,” says Andries Gous, a 29-year-old South African who signed on shortly after Anderson did and will play for the Washington Freedom. “I had no idea that the infrastructure was so far behind.”\nSo it should come as little surprise to learn that Major League Cricket’s six markets, with a combined population of 55.2 million people across their metropolitan areas, had zero existing venues suitable for high-level cricket. Building them all from the ground up would take years Major League Cricket didn’t have if it intended to be ready for 2023. But if it could create even one, the operation would have legs. \nThat made the shell of AirHogs Stadium quite appealing. First, repurposing the old stadium would generate far less red tape than constructing a new one from scratch. Better still, according to William Swann, Major League Cricket’s vice president of corporate development and infrastructure, using the old stadium cut the cost in half. \nThere was just the matter of overhauling it. For that, Major League Cricket turned to HKS and project leads Sergio Chavez and Greg Whittemore—an unusual challenge for the latter, a self-described football guy and soccer fan. “We didn’t grow up playing cricket,” Whittemore says, “and it’s been quite an education for us.” \nTo catch up, they mined what they could from their surroundings, from picking the brains of U.K.- and India-based colleagues to  the lessons learned from the multiuse cricket-rugby stadium HKS designed in Perth, Australia. Then Whittemore and Chavez got to tinkering. They commissioned months-long studies to determine the correct rotation of the wickets to minimize glare when players switched sides. They designed a new lighting system to replicate the effect during night matches. Out went the old seating bowl and the kitschy outfield swimming pool. In came a moving screen positioned deep behind the bowler to replicate a batter’s eye in baseball. Capacity was adjusted to 7,221, with room to expand and accommodate thousands more for big events such as the World Cup. AirHogs Stadium became Grand Prairie Stadium, the temple of American cricket.\nNot all the baseball touches are gone, however. “We’re going to have—I constantly say this—the world’s only cricket ground in a baseball stadium,” says Major League Cricket tournament director Justin Geale. “It’s going to be a meeting of the worlds. It’s not ideally perfect in terms of sightlines and things like that for cricket. But it’s going to be a uniquely American cricket ground and experience.”\nIf that reads like boosterism, that’s the point. Because if there’s one thing everyone associated with Major League Cricket—brass, players, fans, media—agrees on, it’s that high-level cricket alone won’t sufficiently capture public interest. It must be American cricket, a blank slate of a term that Anderson believes is “going to be the biggest struggle” to define. \nAs for what passes for American cricket in 2023, according to Della Penna, “it’s basically adult males who grew up with cricket [overseas], are wildly passionate about it, and they’re trying to sustain that passion, that love, living in America, and that’s driven the quote-unquote growth and the quote-unquote investment in the cricket communities.” The problem is, that hasn’t come hand-in-hand with a grassroots setup capable of carrying that passion outside of their communities. The sport remains too insular to encompass much of the country it’s trying to represent.\nSlowly, this is evolving. Asif Mujtaba settled in Plano in 2006, after a long career with the Pakistani national cricket team, where he briefly served as vice captain. In 2011, he was recruited to start the Dallas Youth Cricket League, one of the dominant youth organizations in the region. Back then, he estimates, maybe 100 kids were playing cricket in North Texas. Now he puts the number at around 1,000—a big spike, but also a pittance compared to soccer, let alone more entrenched sports such as football, basketball, and baseball. Major League Cricket can solve for some of this. It is ramping up efforts to install hybrid wickets—part clay, part synthetic grass—around the country to improve playing conditions. There are 30 league-affiliated academies around the country, a number that figures to grow once Major League Cricket delivers proof of concept that it can polish unproven talents into batsmen ready for the big stage.\n“All the parents want this game to grow and [to know] that my kid has a future in the sport,” Cockley says. “There’s a system, there’s a pathway, and they’re just not a number in an academy paying $300 a month with no future.”\nWhat the league can’t address on its own is the need to go exponentially broader, both in numbers and diversity. For instance, women simply don’t play the sport. In its most recent annual general meeting in October, USA Cricket claimed a national total of 283 registered female players. \nThere’s also the matter of that microscopic 0.1 percent of players outside the Southeast Asian community.  \n“The lazy argument that always gets made is ‘You say you want American, you just mean you want White people playing,’  ” says Della Penna. “Forget about White people. Are you going to find anybody who’s Black, or Mexican American, or Japanese American, whatever? Are they going to be playing? No.”\nThe solution may require a moment more than it does a road map, which is where the United States national team comes in. While Americans may be new to cricket, they’ve got a century’s worth of experience tuning in to support their country in international competition and making heroes out of the victors. Imagine if North Texans get a front-row seat in Grand Prairie to a Cinderella run from the Americans at next year’s World Cup. Better still, imagine that same scenario playing out at the Olympics in five years, when the United States stands to have a much deeper roster if Major League Cricket continues to buttress the domestic talent pool. \n“If somehow, gods help us, we win a medal, all of a sudden you’re sitting at The Tonight Show,” says Lovkesh Kalia, who emigrated from India to Dallas in 1989 and now owns the Dallas Mustangs, the Minor League Cricket team that Anderson captains. Then the dam bursts: more awareness, more stars, more fans, more lobbying power for cricket to get in schools and carve out dedicated spaces in public parks. “It won’t be just the Indians or Pakistanis going out there and asking for something,” he says. “It’d be the overall public asking for something, like it’s happening in soccer.”\nAll of that is bigger than Major League Cricket. It also depends on USA Cricket—an organization historically long on turmoil and short on funds—finding stable footing. It requires USA Cricket, which knows the lay of the land, seeing eye to eye with Major League Cricket, which has achieved so many things their American counterparts never have. All of that is independent of the other checkpoints, like the other five Major League Cricket organizations getting stadiums in their own cities, or those organizations cultivating fan bases patient enough to endure their teams possibly spending the next several summers in North Texas before they ever play a match at home.\n“It’s a long way to go,” says Mujtaba, the Pakistani international turned youth coach, “and it takes a lot of years.”\nBut just as startups fail more often than they succeed, venture capitalists, as a rule, hunt growth and profits. And while finally cracking the American cricket market remains the upside play, the low-hanging fruit for an organization deeply in business with the Indian Premier League is selling a lucrative overseas rights package to the gargantuan Indian market, with its seemingly boundless appetite for world-class cricket. Far more durable cricket scenes have succumbed to that economic pressure. The Caribbean Premier League, one of the world’s most vibrant franchised leagues, aligns half of its playing schedule with prime-time viewing hours in India. What happens if Major League Cricket, with only one local fanbase to cull from out of the gate, can’t even attract the requisite 7,000 spectators to fill Grand Prairie Stadium? What if it does, only to then go the way of the Caribbean Premier League when it staged neutral-site games over a three-year period in Fort Lauderdale? They drew 10,000 people initially and then plummeted to as low as triple-digit numbers by the end. \n“If that’s the route they want to go, then, you know, good luck establishing and embedding yourself in the community and making people in Texas actually care,” Della Penna says. “And then all the talk and all the philosophy about, ‘Oh, we really want to become part of the Texas community. We really want to make this really big in America’—that’s all nonsense.”\nIt would make Major League Cricket a global financial success but an American cultural failure. And the longer it takes for the league to achieve a foothold domestically, the more likely it seems that the money behind the effort will look for a short-term payoff over long-term impact.\n“Eventually, you’re going to have to make a decision,” Gous says. “That’s why it’s so important to get the American market into it. Otherwise, it’s going to happen.”\nUntil a few months ago, the great hope of American cricket was just another lanky college junior studying accounting at UTD’s Richardson campus. Twenty-year-old Ali Sheikh was preparing for a dependable office job after graduation. What was the sense in getting starry-eyed about cricket, his passion since he was a child in Doha, Qatar? \nFor the longest time, it didn’t matter that a global star like Mujtaba, his coach, spotted his talent at 13 years old in their first workout together. Or that Sheikh has gone on to captain the United States under-19 team. Or that a professional like Gous regarded him as “probably the best [player] under 23 in this country,” with his combination of slick fielding and endurance honed during a varsity soccer career at Lebanon Trail High School in Frisco. Cricket in America is a hobby, not a life. \nThen Major League Cricket came along. After a standout performance at the league’s pre-draft combine, Sheikh found himself in Houston for the inaugural draft, where, for what felt like hours, he sat and clapped politely, secure in the knowledge that no one would be calling his name as the draft shifted into the sixth round.\n“And then I hear [the announcer] go, ‘Ali Sheikh,’ ” he says, “and I’m like, Hold on, that’s me.”\nSuddenly there he was, shaking hands on a stage and donning the cap of his new team, the Los Angeles Knight Riders. He is no longer just another accounting major walking the campus at UTD. “People at school know me as ‘the cricket guy,’ ” he says, almost bashfully.  \nThe 20-year-old went to high school in Frisco and was drafted by the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\nBetween the local scene, Minor League Cricket (he’s a teammate of Anderson’s on the Dallas Mustangs), and now Major League Cricket, he’s making real money in the sport. His parents are encouraging him to take a gap year to focus on his game. \n“At the start, I felt like it couldn’t be a full-time job,” he says. “Now I feel like it could easily be a full-time job.”\nMajor League Cricket is counting on exactly that. If the league reaches its potential as a cultural force in America, it won’t be on the backs of players like Corey Anderson, vital as he is. It will happen because it minted a generation of American-born stars to rise through the ranks and stake their claim as faces of both the league and the United States national team, creating competition and representation along the way. \n“We need,” says Geale, the Major League Cricket tournament director, “literally another 10 Ali Sheikhs.”\nAnd why couldn’t it happen? For all Sheikh’s gifts and drive, Cockley, who has worked with him since Sheikh was 16, is quick to note that “he also benefited from being in the right time in history.” A time when the American cricketer suddenly has an endgame to aspire to and a pathway to achieve it. When in North Texas, especially, they’ll be surrounded by sharp minds and blossoming infrastructure and world-class talent to test their skills. \nSheikh has yet to play a match at Grand Prairie Stadium, but as Mujtaba says, “for the young people, he is an inspiration.” There is finally something, someone, to aspire to. \nWhich is why Major League Cricket’s first significant victory didn’t take place in a boardroom or with a player recruitment or during a groundbreaking ceremony, but on a phone conversation a few days after the Major League Cricket draft, between Kalia’s nephew, Bhavesh, and one of the Mustangs’ next stars, 17-year-old Rishi Ramesh. “I’m gonna get serious about cricket now,” Ramesh told the younger Kalia, so much so that, when it comes time for college, he’s considering online classes at UTD to give him the flexibility needed to train and compete. \nRamesh has a goal in mind, and if Major League Cricket’s vision takes root, he’ll be far from the only one. He doesn’t want to become an accountant. \n“I want to be the next Ali Sheikh,” he said.    \nThis story originally appeared in the July issue of D Magazine with the headline, “Batter Up.” Write to [email protected]. \nAttractions\nBars and Clubs\nShops\nRestaurants\n\n750 North St.Paul St.\nSuite 2100\nDallas, Texas 75201\n\n\nTel: 214.939.3636\n \nFax: 214.748.4579\n"

That brings us to the end of our coverage, both for tonight and for this edition of the MLC. Hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed bringing it to you. Until next time, this is me (Shashwat) signing off on behalf of Binoy George, all our commentators and everyone at ESPNcricinfo. Goodbye and take care!\n11:31pm Sunil Gavaskar presents the inaugural MLC trophy to Pooran and the MI New York players break into their celebrations. They deserve every bit of it. A week ago, they were not sure if they were going to be in the playoffs. They then had to win three successive games to win the title and they have done so with some conviction.\nNicholas Pooran, the MI New York captain is also the Player of the Match: (Thoughts on the tournament) We spoke today about having an opportunity to do something special. Losing our captain, losing a couple of players along the way - our players stuck together. I am very proud of everything every individual did, everyone contributed in some way. (On the score) It was definitely game on (at the half-way stage) but we knew we had a good batting wicket. We gave away 20 more runs. We were prepared for this (based on how the last week has gone). We had to be confident, back our skills and we got over the line. (How he did what he did out in the middle) I have to give credit to Taylor for getting out so early (smiles). Told myself that I just needed to bat like Nicky P and not think about batting like the captain. I just backed my skills. The platform was there today and the opportunity was there. I had to be brave and it worked for me. Happy that I could see it through to the end - that is what I have been working on for the past 5-6 years. Just want to thank the fans and the support, it has been amazing.\nTrent Boult takes home the award for being the leading wicket-taker, with Nicholas Pooran ending up as the leading run-scorer and the MVP of the inaugural edition of the MLC!\nCameron Gannon is the domestic player of the tournament: (How happy is he to get the award) Pleasing to get some acknowledgement. Tonight is about MI New York. They played unbelievably, Nicky P in particular - have not seen anything like that in my life. (On the MLC and what it means) It has been a wonderful tournament. The quality has been exceptional. Having overseas players, and playing this tournament has been so much fun. I think it is going to be fantastic for USA cricket moving forward. (On what his plans are moving forward) I am looking forward to coming back (in the MLC) if I can. I think I would like to play in a World Cup, that would be pretty nice. I am 34 now, not looking too far into the future.\nWayne Parnell, Seattle Orcas captain: (His thoughts) As a professional, losing hurts every time. Whenever someone plays like that, you have to give them credit. Last time we played them, we had Klaasen play that sort of innings. Credit to Nicky and his team. It (toss) was a little bit of a factor. First 10-12 overs, it was a little bit slower. When the lights took over, it got quicker. It did not look like he (Pooran) would mishit a ball today. It was a decent total but have to give them credit today. (Message to the fans) First season has gone really well. Credit to everyone who has organized it. Credit to our owners and the management for picking this team and giving us the freedom to play this brand of cricket.\nKieron Pollard, who has Dwayne Bravo on the phone: (On how special the win is) Very, very special. Kudos must go to the guys on the field. They took the team from the Eliminator to the total, very produ of the guys. (On Pooran knock) Very, very special. All the people that were here and were watching on TV, we get to witness something special. (On what the franchise intends to do moving forward) We are not going to sit on our laurels and we will continue to raise the bar.\nTim David: (How special this is) Championships are hard to win. Lost a couple of finals but got over the line this time. Very special innings from Nicky P (Pooran), awesome. I had the first-class seat in the house and it was just magical. It was a slow start but in the end, we really gelled. Everyone contributed at some point. It takes a whole squad to win the tournament and we did it.\nShayan Jahangir: Loved it. The support we have been getting from the franchise, the owners and the support staff has been commendable. The backing got us this trophy. Lot of exposure. The amount of talent we have in the world, we can match any country in the world. The exposure is going to take us places and put USA cricket on the map.\nTrent Boult: (His secret) There is no secret. When it comes to finals, it is about enjoying it. What a way to finish the tournament - to see some fireworks from Pooran, it was special. I am sure I will see my kids in a second and I will enjoy that.\nNosthush Kenjige: (On how much he enjoyed out) Could not have asked for more. Some of the shots Pooran played, I don't think I have ever seen anything like it. Been incredible to share the dressing room with countless people I have grown up watching.\nKagiso Rabada: It is great to win in the inaugural year. Very stoked. Unbelievable game. Good to see Nicky P play the way he is. (On Pooran) There was no way to get him out tonight. That was close to the innings of his life. He was also facing good bowlers too and did it in a pressure situation. Unbelievable to witness.\nRashid Khan: (On this franchise) I had just three hours to come here and get ready (for my first game). We have started with a trophy here and we will try to keep that going. Special win, this was the first edition, and this was my first trophy with the MI family.\nDavid Wiese: Amazing effort from everyone to put this tournament together. Been a fantastic experience for everybody. Being the first team to win it, it is special. It has been amazing. Cannot remember a game that was not a sellout. Our supporters have been amazing. (On the party plans) I am a little old now to go too hard but I am sure we will enjoy everyone's company.\nDewald Brevis: Everything works out as it should. Great to be a part of the MLC. We are grateful it worked out. Just ready to celebrate now (smiles). (On being around the experienced players) It is a great learning curve, you just keep learning. That is how you keep developing.\n10:52pm Phew. What a run-chase that was. Pooran ended up with 388 runs in the tournament, with 137 of those coming off just 55 balls tonight. At the half-way stage, the Orcas seemed a touch ahead, especially after how they finished their innings. Taylor departed in the first over too, strengthening the Orcas' grip on the game.\nThereafter, though, it was the Pooran show. He cleared the fence 13 times and hit 10 more fours, putting any and every bowler to the sword. He found support at different junctures but tonight was all about one man, and it was the MINY skipper.\nAs for the Orcas, they will be a little disappointed with their execution. But when Pooran is in such form, there is not a lot you can do. All of their bowlers were dismantled and on the big occasion, they just could not turn up to stop the Pooran juggernaut.\nPooran finishes it off, rather fittingly! Not the authoritative shot he was after but it is four nonetheless! Searing yorker on leg stump that knocks Pooran off his feet. But he has been in such form today that even on this occasion, he somehow gets the right amount of bat to squeeze it past short fine leg. He ends up on the deck but the squeal of delight tells a story in itself. A truly magnificent knock - one that has blown the Orcas out of the water and has catapulted MINY into MLC folklore!\nwide yorker outside off. Pooran swings himself off his feet (metaphorically, of course) and somehow manages to toe-end it past short third man for a brace\nMINY just one hit away from lifting the MLC. Guess who's on strike...\nslower yorker on leg stump. David eases it down to long on for one\nfull delivery on middle and off stump. David absolutely laces his off-drive but cannot beat the fielder at mid off\nyorker outside off. Pooran squeezes it out to deep backward point with an open bat face\nshort and wide outside off. David throws his hands at it and flays it towards deep point for a single\nJust nine needed now off 30 balls. Can MINY ice this run-chase this over?\nmake that three in a row! Low full toss on leg stump. Pooran gets his front foot out of the way and whacks it a mile over deep mid wicket!\nback-to-back sixes! Slowed up on a length on leg stump but it makes no difference to Pooran. Gets down on one knee and smears it over cow corner. 12th six of the innings for Pooran!\nfetch that! Harmeet tries to bowl at the stumps and that is just what Pooran is waiting for. Plants his front foot and wallops it over long on!\ngets it away this time! Another full delivery outside leg. This one, though, is a little wider and allows Pooran to beat short fine leg to his right\nvery full and just outside leg. Pooran gets inside the line and paddles but cannot beat short fine leg\nlength delivery way outside off. Left alone by Pooran and called a wide by the umpire\nfull just outside off. David has a mighty swing at it and toe-ends it towards long on\nanother excellent yorker outside off. Pooran tries to dab it fine but is late on the stroke. Plays and misses\nwide yorker that Pooran cannot do much with. Digs it out towards extra cover\nAround the wicket now\ndisdainful! Slower delivery that sits up to be hit outside off. Pooran strolls across his crease as if he is walking in his garden and then slams it over square leg!\ndug into the track outside off again. David waits in his crease and pulls it towards deep mid wicket\npower! Half-tracker outside off. David sizes up the length early and slaps it past deep backward square leg for four!\nRahul Vats : \"Nicholas Pooran. Nicholas Pooran. What an Innings. Driving the energy spectrometer through the roof. One of the best Innings I have witnessed.\"\nback of a length just outside off. David goes feeling for it and sees the ball whiz past the shoulder of the bat\nTye returns\nRun-a-ball required in the seven overs that remain, and MINY are firmly in control of this game. The Orcas need a couple of quick wickets to make a fist of this defence...\nfull just outside off. David drills it back to the bowler, who misfields and ends up conceding a single\nOver 16 • MI NY 184/3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Success! Top-notch talent flew in from across the globe to compete, and the hometown Texas Super Kings drew sellout crowds. If you were there, you likely saw what those of us at D did: this is a sporting experience different than anything we’re used to in these parts. A great one. (With pretty damn good stadium food, too!)\nThat isn’t to say obstacles don’t remain; I outlined many of them in my feature from our July issue. MLC will need to keep scaling up just as infrastructure on the grassroots level must become more robust. Five other cities must construct their own equivalent to Grand Prairie Stadium. It must convince one-off fans to become casuals, and casuals to become diehards. There is plenty of work to be done.\nBut that’s all in the future.

  "body": "The arrival of Major League Cricket — the USA's first-ever professional T20 franchise cricket league — will open up new avenues for the sport, and its fans, in North America.\nSanctioned by USA Cricket — the official governing body for cricket in the US — the creation of a professional league for what is still considered to be a niche sport should accelerate the mainstream popularity of cricket throughout the region. At least that is the organizers' plan.\nThe sport actually already has something of a tradition in North America. Some might think that the oldest cricket rivalry is between England and Australia. However, that isn't actually the case. According to Tom Melville's 'A History of Cricket in America', before the Civil War, cricket was actually the most famous sport in the country.\nAn international contest took place in 1844 between USA and Canada and is known to be one of the earliest cricketing rivalries.\nMore than 175 years on, for a large chunk of the American population the sport of cricket is a puzzling question mark. Some people associate it with baseball, while others believe that the game is not fast enough to engage their interest. But what exactly is cricket and how is it played?\nEssentially, cricket is an often tense cat-and-mouse game between two teams of 11 players. The sport can be played in three formats: T20s, One-Day Internationals and Test matches.\nMajor League Cricket will be played in the T20 format, a variation that typically lasts for three to four hours.\nThe team batting first wants to score as many runs as possible by running between the stumps at each end of the pitch, or by hitting the ball hard — hard enough to fly over the fielders and beyond a rope at the boundary, to earn that team four runs (for crossing the boundary having bounced) or six runs (for crossing the boundary on the fly).\nA cricket pitch is the central rectangular strip between the wickets that is 22 yards long and 10 feet wide. And wickets are the three stumps placed at both ends of the pitch.\nThe aim of the game is to put a mammoth total on the scoreboard that will prove insurmountable for the opposition. Meanwhile, the bowling team is looking to keep the run total down by getting the batting team's batters out of the field as quickly as possible — either by hitting the wickets, catching the ball when it's been hit by a batter, or forcing the batter to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps directly by using their protective leg pads, rather than their bat (known as Leg Before Wicket, or LBW).\nIn T20s, like the MLC, each bowler gets four overs, and one over consists of six balls. Once all the balls have been bowled, or all the batters are out, the teams switch roles.\nOne-Day Internationals are similar, but each team has 50 overs, rather than 20, while Test matches are the longest format of the game and take place over five days, with both teams batting twice over two innings and their run total from both being combined.\nFrustratingly for some neutrals, Test matches can be played for five days and still end in a draw if one team has not won in that time!\nMORE: MLC 2023 results and matches\nWhile the way that cricket is played across the world is broadly the same, each specific competition can have slight variations on rules relating to rosters and the like.\nIn MLC, every team can have a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 19 players on its squad. Each roster will need to have one domestic Under-23 rookie player, to help promote cricket in the USA and develop future generations of American players.\nOn its complete roster, each team may have nine international players. However, no more than six of those players will be allowed in the playing 11.\nIn MLC, each team will play in the round-robin format against one another. The four teams that emerge on top of the points table will then qualify for the playoffs.\nThe playoffs will include the Eliminator, the Challenger, the Qualifier and the Final. That Final will be played between the winner of the Qualifier and the Challenger on July 30.\nDate \u0026 Time\nGame\nVenue\n07/27/2023, 03:30 PM CDT\nSeed 3 vs Seed 4\nGrand Prairie Stadium, TX\n07/27/2023, 07:30 PM CDT\nSeed 1 vs Seed 2\nGrand Prairie Stadium, TX\n07/28/2023, 07:30 PM CDT\nLoser Qualifier vs Winner Eliminator\nGrand Prairie Stadium, TX\n07/30/2023, 07:30 PM CDT\nWinner Qualifier vs Winner Challenger\nGrand Prairie Stadium, TX\nLots to take in? Don’t worry, MLC has got you covered.\nSpectators at the stadiums unaware of the rules will receive 'Cricket 101' flyers and get access to ambassadors who will help them understand the game, with the action taking place at the Grand Prairie stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina from July 13-30.\nVishakha Deshpande is a content producer for The Sporting News."

  "body": "Filed under:\nHere’s everything you need to know about Major League Cricket.\nMajor League Cricket, the first T20 cricket competition in the United States, will begin Thursday, July 13 with the Texas Super Kings taking on the Los Angeles Knight Riders. Here’s everything you need to know about this competition.\nThis league has been in the works for quite some time, and will finally be taking place this summer. It is backed by the founders of Willow TV, the primary cricket broadcaster in North America, several prominent investors and the Times Group of India.\nInterestingly enough, the first ever international cricket match on record was played in the United States between America and Canada. Now, this was back in the 1800s and Americans likely saw cricket as a British game and gravitated more towards baseball. That doesn’t mean the game isn’t prominent across the country at a grassroots level. \nUSA does have an international team, and just played in the ODI World Cup qualifiers. They didn’t win a single match, but they will be more prominently featured in the 2024 T20 World Cup as a co-host with the West Indies.\nThere are six teams in MLC this season. They are the Super Kings, Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians New York, Washington Freedom, Seattle Orcas and San Francisco Unicorns. If some of those names sound familiar, it’s because four of the six teams are owned by IPL franchise owners. Three of them have adopted the IPL team name in Texas, LA and New York.\nThere will be just 19 games in the tournament, which will run over two weeks. 15 games will be in the group stage. There will be an eliminator, two qualifiers and a final similar to the IPL playoffs.\nThere won’t be any big-name Indian players due to BCCI regulations and the team currently being on tour, but MLC did a great job bagging other big names. Kieron Pollard, Faf du Plessis, Jason Roy, Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Aaron Finch and Quinton de Kock have all been prominent on the international cricket scene. Many of the fans attending these games will know those players.\nThere are two venues for MLC games this season. Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas is the main venue and has the first eight group games, while Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina will have the next seven group games. The playoffs return to Grand Prairie Stadium. This is surely a trial run for the expansion of venues across the country, especially since there’s no North Carolina-based team.\nAll games will be broadcasted on Willow TV and available through willow.tv with a subscription login.\nAccording to DraftKings Sportsbook, Mumbai Indians New York are the slight favorites at +380, followed by the Freedom and Orcas at +400 each. The Super Kings, Knight Riders and Unicorns are all listed at +450.\n\n\n\n\n\nGAMBLING PROBLEM?

  "body": "CRICKET is back in the Olympics and Jamaica must seize this opportunity. \nIt was predictable, and the International Cricket Council (ICC) had been working on it for years. In Twenty20 (T20) they found a workable, widely played format with such revenue virility it became an irresistible progeniture. While content acquisition budgets are exploding and being gobbled up by both old and new individual leagues with addressable fan bases, Olympic revenue growth is burdened by too many un-monetisable sports. Even our hallowed track and field as an individual sport isn't amongst the top ten watched globally.\nThe English Premier League (football) and Indian Premier League (cricket) with their US$6-billion domestic rights deals, and even Major League Soccer's US$2.5-billion agreement with AppleTVillustrate the siphoning of resources by even previously unheralded sports leagues. With the ever-increasing cost of hosting, it was inevitable the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would welcome back cricket to tap into its massive viewership and burgeoning coffers. Experts are already predicting a tenfold increase in Olympic rights in India - a US$200-million-dollar impact. Coinciding with T20 being confirmed as the latest Olympic sport, the United States is co-hosting the T20 World Cup in 2024. No sooner had Major League Cricket concluded its first successful season in the US, a new \"American Cricket League\" is announced. Perhaps it's just a remarkable coincidence or maybe these are unencrypted, not-so-secret transmissions for which we require no special enigma cypher.\nImpact on Jamaican Cricket\nBeing an Olympic sport fosters investment and development. Since only individual nations can participate in the Olympics as a rule, West Indies cricket, that amorphous, non-existent nation, must tap its component countries to extract the precious and badly needed benefits. There should be no thought of abandoning Jamaica's Olympic legacy and competing under a \"WI\" umbrella. We are Olympic royalty; the black, green and gold hoisted above all others to the crescendo of \"Jamaica, land we love\" is as much our identity as being synonymous with the Olympics itself.\nICC craved Olympic recognition to accelerate growth in the sport globally, especially among its 96 associate member countries. As an Olympic sport these governing bodies will have stronger cases to harvest national resources from both public and private sector purses, not to mention the potential sliver of Olympic revenues. The Olympic imprint carries a special aura that transcends commercial, corporate social responsibility and government budgets, bringing unique funding dexterity. It's also why the NFL lobbied the IOC so hard and successfully to have American \"flag football\" included.\nOlympic Qualification\nThe Jamaica Cricket Association (JCA) and its regional counterparts should propose and lobby the ICC and IOC for the structuring of Olympic qualification to favour our interest. Notwithstanding the initial limit of six male and female teams for 2028, let's think medium and long term. Olympic soccer started with eight teams back in 1908, which has since doubled. It could be eight T20 national teams by the Brisbane edition in 2032, growing to 10 or 12 by 2036, Mumbai being the hot favourite to host. Surely, Jamaica has the capability to plot our path to at least the latter as an Olympic cricket team.\nLet's propose that the only automatic Olympic qualifiers be the top four ICC-ranked teams. Where it gets interesting is how we might determine the non-automatic qualifiers. The ICC currently holds geographic regional qualifiers for the T20 World Cup. Indeed, teams like Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Panama, Argentina, etc battle through these regionals (Americas, Asia, etc). A Caribbean Olympic Qualification Region should be added. Given that there are 14 countries under CWI, our contribution to world cricket, and with no other way to participate, we deserve our own qualification region. Imagine the new prestige of Jamaica vs Barbados in a \"T20 Olympic Qualifier\" under the lights at Sabina Park. The life it could breathe back into regional cricket is immeasurable! The top two from the Caribbean region would join the other ranked ICC teams and regional qualifiers in a tournament for the remaining spots on the Olympic stage. In T20 any team, on any day, in the right conditions, can win. That's the simplistic beauty T20 has brought to the game, levelling the playing field. So why can't we see Jamaica beating England in a T20 eliminator for a shot at Olympic glory!\nThe same should be done for T20 World Cup qualifiers. Imagine our Caribbean teams battling it out in T20 World Cup qualification every two years and the Olympics every four. Don't be surprised. And maybe it's inevitable, given the meteoric rise of T20, if the Pan American Games gets added to the mix. That would be a non-stop, competitive international calendar for national T20 teams. Ultimately, this must benefit WI cricket. Of course there is the sticky issue of the CPL and any prohibitions on inter-country, competitive T20 matches. But surely there is a difference between franchise cricket and a national team playing to qualify for the Olympic Games.\nIf we continue to ignore it all and pretend nothing has changed we could see lesser teams like Oman, Japan and even Denmark one day make their Olympic mark in a sport we once dominated, while we wistfully muse on the glory days and what might have been. We need to look no further than the Netherlands' rise to see the future. I believe we should dream big and be proactive if we are to benefit from cricket returning to the Olympics. It will not be easy and won't happen overnight. It will require strategy, determination and courage.\nBut perhaps it is a last, beckoning chance to return Jamaica and WI cricket to relevance.\nEditor's note: Chris Dehring is the former WICB chief marketing executive and CEO of ICC CWC 2007.

America might be a baseball country, he says, but there’s no reason why cricket can’t be slowly injected into its landscape, especially because newer audiences are willing to look beyond the traditional favourites. The country also has a history with the game—the first ever international cricket match was played between the US and Canada, in 1844, a good 33 years before the first Test match was played between England and Australia. MLC has made a good start, but the focus in the next few years will be on finetuning the platform and building a new audience, Dunmore tells Forbes India in an interview. Edited excerpts:  Q. The group stage of Major League Cricket (MLC) is over. Your first thoughts on T20 cricket in America? We’ve sold out all the seven games in North Carolina and the first few games in Dallas, although these are relatively small venues. The stadium in Dallas is 6,000-7,000 capacity, while the former is about 3,500.

  "body": "Published on 7/10/2023 at 12:00 PM\nBaseball may be America’s national pastime, but globally its popularity doesn’t come close to cricket. The other—and much older—game with bats and balls has origins dating back to the 16th century, and estimates put its fanbase at more than 2.5 billion people, second only to soccer. Major League Cricket debuts July 13 in Dallas, er, Grand Prairie technically. With this newly formed US pro league, fans in North Texas and around the country will have a chance to cheer on local teams in person.\nThe new league features six teams, including the Texas Super Kings, which will play its games in Grand Prairie. Other teams are based in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington DC.\n“The Dallas area has one of the largest groups of cricket fans in the country, with hundreds of thousands of expats from countries such as India and Pakistan in the area who love the game,” says Tom Dumore, VP of Marketing for Major League Cricket.\nAll matches take on the Twenty20 (or “T20”) format, which is a shortened version of the traditional game that was introduced professionally about two decades ago.\nHere’s what you need to know.\n \n“Cricket dates back to the 16th century, and sometimes the perception of it in the general population in the US is that it’s a stuffy game for British men in top hats, but nothing could be further from the truth,” says Dunmore. The T20 format, especially, is known for its fast-paced play, big hits, music, and fireworks. Matches clock in around two and a half hours, and the ball’s in play a lot more than in baseball, where abundant strikeouts can keep fans waiting multiple innings for action. For more on the rules, check out this helpful explainer from Vox.\n \nEarlier this year, MLC hosted a draft that allowed each team to select nine domestic players—most plucked from the Minor League Cricket circuit—and round out their rosters with international signings. Captain Faf du Plessis hails from South Africa and has enjoyed a successful career there as well as in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nThe Super Kings are coached by Stephen Fleming, a former captain of New Zealand’s national cricket team and the current head coach of IPL team the Chennai Super Kings. That’s not just a coincidence. The Texas team is co-owned by the Chennai Super Kings along with Ross Perot Jr. and businessman Anurag Jain.\n \nThe inaugural season is more like a tournament, with 19 matches played July 13 through July 30, when the championship takes place in Grand Prairie. Dunmore explains that next year is likely to enlist a similar format, especially as the T20 Men’s Cricket World Cup will also host games in the US. But as the league grows and stadiums are built in the home cities for each team, we can expect the season to expand in length and matches to occur in more markets.\n \nThe Super Kings have taken over the old AirHogs baseball stadium in Grand Prairie, renovating the space to accommodate 7,000 fans and a professional cricket pitch. The majority of games will be played in Grand Prairie this season, with additional games held at a dedicated cricket pitch in Morrisville, North Carolina, outside of Raleigh.\nThe first match is Thursday, July 13, when the Texas Super Kings take on the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\nIf you can’t attend in person, no worries, matches will also be available to watch on TV. Live matches will be shown on Willow TV, a dedicated cricket channel, and available to stream on Sling TV.\n“There’s a reason the IPL now rivals the NFL and the English Premier League for media rights revenue,” adds Dunmore. “It’s a fantastic experience to watch live on TV or in person.”\n \nWant more Thrillist?

It’s the first game of a new professional cricket league for the United States.\nThe bat-and-ball sport that’s kinda but not really like baseball is hugely popular in a lot of places that used to be part of the British empire. \nBut here in the U.S.? Not so much.\n​The leaders of the startup Major League Cricket hope to change that. They’ve invested $100 million to set up a six-team league — with rosters that include international stars — that will compete over the next two weeks.\nThe league is banking on interest from South Asian communities in the U.S. But the road to turning a profit could be bumpy.\nCricket has grown a lot in the U.S. since Ravi Etwaroo started his cricket equipment business in the Bronx, New York, in 2006.\n“We have local schools, high schools now taking part in cricket. We have college cricket,” Etwaroo said.\nMuch of that growth is an effect of South Asian immigration to the U.S. Cricket has a huge fan base in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Now, Major League Cricket hopes to take the sport pro here — and tap into those growing communities and their enthusiasm, said league spokesperson Tom Dunmore. \n“This probably wouldn’t have the same upside if we were doing this in the 1980s or even early ’90s,” Dunmore said.\nThere are now over 5 million Americans with roots in South Asia. Plus, there are expats from other cricket hotbeds — the U.K., Australia, South Africa and the Caribbean. \nThe next question is, “Would Americans take this on wholesale? And that’s probably going to take a lot longer,” said Stefan Szymanski, a professor of sport management at the University of Michigan.\nMajor League Cricket is keeping its ambitions relatively small for now, with the season just two weeks long. And even though all of its matches will be played in Texas and North Carolina this year, its teams are assigned homes — Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Washington and Texas, all locations where the league hopes to build stadiums.\nEven if it manages to expand, profitability could be further off, said Victor Matheson, a sports economist at the College of the Holy Cross.\n“This is not something you measure success in months or years. It really is something you measure in decades,” Matheson said.\nEven the NFL took that long to get a foothold, he said.\n“The folks that think, you know, ‘Oh, if we can just get through year one or two, we’re set,’ are deceiving themselves,” Matheson added.\nThe league said its inaugural season will be broadcast in cricketing nations around the world, and if you want to watch it here, you have to subscribe to a channel called Willow TV. \nThere’s a lot happening in the world.  Through it all, Marketplace is here for you. \nYou rely on Marketplace to break down the world’s events and tell you how it affects you in a fact-based, approachable way.

(WNCN) — Thousands of fans crowded into Church Street Park in Morrisville Monday evening for another sellout at a Major League Cricket match. \nThe league, in its first season, has had full attendance in all of its games in both Texas and North Carolina.\n“These are the biggest games that’ll happen out here. 70-80 of the world’s best players in a very, very intimate setting, everyone close together, fans enjoying it. This is a dream come true for us,” said Sameer Mehta, the co-founder of MLC.\nPeople from across the country and world are in the Triangle for these matches. One fan held up a sign during Monday’s matchup saying they had come from Canada.\nWith the stands filled, dozens of fans even gathered outside the park, looking through a fence in hopes of catching even a glimpse of the action.\n“Someone who loves the sport, has played the sport for a long time, this is phenomenal,” said Sanjay Pal.\nPal has lived in the Triangle since the 1990s, helping to grow cricket locally since then.\n“Actually right next to this is the original field, which is called the Shiloh Cricket Field, which some of us helped build. And then I was fortunate enough to run the cricket league in the area for a couple of years in 2000-2001, and then it’s just taken off since then,” Pal said.\nCricket captures the hearts of many across different corners of the globe. Fans and organizers are hopeful the U.S. and Morrisville won’t be any different.\n“This version of cricket we play takes about three to four hours a game, and you will see a lot of families, younger families come together. That’s kind of the next evolution of cricket from the traditional cricket that’s been there for hundreds of years,” said Pal.\n“If we had a larger stadium we’d sell that out, if we had a stadium five times the size, we’d sell that out. The community out here is passionate about the sport, and they know a good product when they see one,” Mehta added.\nMLC will have its final match in Morrisville Tuesday night before returning to Texas for the remainder of the season.\nCopyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

Get features like\nDespite its long association with cricket - it entered North America as early as the 18th century through British colonies - the United States of America never quite saw the sport spread its wings. At a time cricket saw rapid growth in countries like Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, it was nowhere near an A-listed sport in the USA. Its popularity was no match for soccer, basketball, tennis and of course, baseball, which was America's simpler and indigenous version of the game of bat and ball. All this, however, may change soon with the advent of Major League Cricket (MLC).\nThe inaugural edition, which featured six teams - Seattle Orcas, MI New York, Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom, Sanfrancisco Unicorns, and Los Angeles Knight Riders - saw packed houses, huge interests and swelled-up viewership, prompting the organisers to dream bigger. \nThat the final will be played in front of a full house was expected but the kind of crowd that gathered in Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas during the league games, took everyone by surprise. Over the course of the nine match days at the venue, it was 80% to its capacity on average every day, while the Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina saw a sell-out in its six match days. \nIt means that more than 70,000 spectators saw season one of MLC, bringing in $2.8 million in ticket sales revenue. This is an astounding amount for any match played on US soil, excluding India's regular trips to Lauderhill to play T20 Internationals against the West Indies.\nSports entrepreneur and investor, Joe Pompliano in his podcast ‘The Joe Pomp Show’, termed cricket as the second-most followed sport in the world. Pompliano said cricket, with 2.5 billion fans worldwide, is only behind football in terms of global popularity. To add more context to his numbers, he compared the Instagram followers of star India batter Virat Kohli with leading sportspersons across the globe.\n\"For context on how big cricket is outside the US: Virat Kohli has 256 million Instagram followers, which is more than LeBron James, Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Shohei Ohtani, Patrick Mahomes, and Tiger Woods....combined,\" he said.\nShohei Ohtani, the current heartthrob of USA baseball fans, has only 6 million followers.\nQuoting data from a report, Pompliano added that India is the biggest market for cricket with close to 550 million people engaging with the sport annually. As astonishing as this may sound, there are no other full member nations in the top five apart from India. The data says China is the second-biggest market for cricket with 408 million people showing interest in cricket annually while the USA is third on the list with 63 million interested in cricket per year.\nDespite near-zero participation in ICC tournaments, such a high demand for cricket in the USA comes largely from its immigration population mainly from cricket-crazy countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Singapore. This huge interest was one of the primary reasons behind MLC's birth. Big investors saw an opportunity to cash in on the craze.\n\"A group of investors that includes the CEOs of Microsoft and Adobe has raised $120 million to build Major League Cricket in the United States,\" said Pompliano.\nReports state that this could just be the beginning of what could turn out to be the biggest sporting league in the USA. The rousing success of the first edition of the MLC has already given rise to the organisers considering bigger stadiums in New York and Los Angeles. According to an ESPNCricinfo report, MLC could collaborate with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to build a 34,000-seat pop-up venue in New York City at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bron.\nIf that proposal gets the greenlight then It could be one of the three venues for next year's ICC T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by USA and West Indies.\nAnother major factor going in MLC's favour is the fact that the USA Cricket Association has given sole rights to MLC to host professional cricket tournaments in the country. That means MLC organisers have a monopoly and they can be the biggest channel between USACA and ICC to take the game to new heights.\n \n\n At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

A sea of yellow filled Grand Prairie Stadium, whistling and cheering for the Dallas area’s newest sports team, the Texas Super Kings.\nFans supporting the local team didn’t leave disappointed, either. The Super Kings put on a dominant display, defeating the Los Angeles Knight Riders 181-112.\nSea of Yellove in Texas💛#TSKvsLAKR #TexasSuperFans #WhistleForTexas pic.twitter.com/1TycE6C9u6\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\nHip-hop music blared through the stadium speakers, and cheers grew louder as a countdown appeared on the scoreboard, counting down to the first ball of the inaugural MLC season.\n“This is cricket’s American dream,” was said on the opening of the TV broadcast.\nSince the start of the Indian Premier League in 2008, professional cricket has become a lucrative business across the world. However, that success abroad never translated in the U.S.\nLeagues such as the American Premier League and Pro Cricket started in the U.S., but could never come near the success of the sport abroad.\nMLC hopes to change that, and Thursday night was the first step. The match was sold out, as over 6,000 tickets were claimed, creating a celebratory atmosphere for opening night.\n“It felt like we were definitely the home team,” Super Kings captain Faf Du Plessis said.\nEach fan received a Super Kings flag when they entered the stadium, creating a sea of yellow in the stands. Smoke, fireworks and drums rang out with every big hit, generating consistent excitement throughout the night.\nEven for the most casual fan, the match delivered exciting moments from the first ball. The Super Kings piled on 181 runs in the first innings, as Lahiru Milantha hit the first six. Ten more followed as the ball flew out of the park in the Texas humidity. After an innings of runs and sixes, the excitement shifted to an innings of wickets when the Knight Riders were up to bat. They were unable to chase the Super Kings’ score, and after 10 of the 11 Knight Riders players were out, the match was over.\nChants of “T-S-K” rang out as the fans exited the stadium.\nIt was the perfect platform to introduce a sport that has garnered hundreds of millions of views across the world to an American audience that felt long overdue for a product at the highest level. International stars such as Du Plessis and Devin Conway featured for the Super Kings, giving many hardcore D-FW cricket fans a chance to see their favorite players for the first time.\nThe crowd was a mix of die-hard cricket fans and Dallas-area sports fans looking for a new type of entertainment. Among the Super Kings jerseys, India jerseys and various jerseys representing teams in the Indian Premier League, were a number of fans wearing Rangers, Cowboys and other Texas-themed sports attire.\nWhile much of MLC’s promotion targeted the hardcore fans, the mix that was present on opening night symbolized the opportunity on which the league is looking to capitalize.\n“Just very excited to see what is gonna pan out over the next couple years,” Du Plessis said. “I think its got a great future.”\nThe opening night atmosphere laid the foundation, and the hype is expected to continue. Matches on Saturday and Monday are already sold out, according to a league spokesperson, signaling a successful start to the league’s inaugural season.\nMatches will continue throughout July and will stay in Grand Prairie for the rest of the opening weekend. The action will then move to Church Street Park in Morrisville, N.C., returning to Grand Prairie for playoffs starting July 27.\nOn Twitter: @peter_rauterkus\nPeter Rauterkus.

  "source": "Cricket Web",
  "body": "\n\nMajor League Cricket launched in the United States in 2023 in a longstanding attempt to bring the game to American audiences. Ownership groups from the Indian Premier League have brought their respective franchises to the USA, including the Super Kings, Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, and Delhi Capitals, while two of the other franchises have support from Australian states New South Wales and Cricket Victoria.\nAs a result, many stars of the white-ball format such as England’s World Cup winners Jason Roy and Liam Plunkett along with international stars Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, and Kagiso Rabada are plying their trade in the new league.\nThe immediate attraction of star power has resulted in a competitive series, and perhaps more importantly sell-out crowds for the six teams and venues in Major League Cricket situated across the United States.\nThe question now for Major League Cricket and all involved is whether the competition is sustainable in an already jam-packed schedule for both domestic and international cricket.\nTaking cricket into the mainstream of US audiences has always been a dream of the International Cricket Council, but there has never been the right demand. Challenging the entrenched hierarchy of baseball as America’s summer sport is always going to be a daunting prospect and it won’t change any time soon.\nAudiences have responded to Major League Cricket, selling out the six stadia over a three-week period. The news will please the ownership groups of all six franchises, but there will be the desire to see the league expand in the coming years if it can sustain its success and appeal to American fans. It has been popular too among the leading betting sites in the United States, who have all carried MLC odds for individual games and futures markets.\nSo, there is plenty of evidence that there is a foundation for Major League Cricket to build on.\nThe inaugural Major League Cricket season had only 19 games in its schedule, including four playoff games. Compared to over major T20 leagues in the world, the competition is a small one, which could well play into its hands given the schedule.\nAmerican fans may appreciate the novelty of a short sharp competition that allows them to enjoy a niche sport for a couple of weeks before tuning back into baseball. The problem Major League Cricket will have is to determine whether these fans are enjoying the novelty for one season or whether it can be sustained over a period of time.\nOther T20 leagues around the world have benefitted from being situated in countries where cricket already has a strong following, notably South Africa where SA20 was launched in 2023. The structure of the league is similar to Major League Cricket, where the franchises were also owned by the leading IPL outfits. SA20 enjoyed a fruitful first season, but they too will have the issue of sustainability over a long period of time, including one of the key issues that could make or break Major League Cricket.\nThe primary issue that Major League Cricket faces is its competition. It fits into the international cricket schedule at the height of the English summer, meaning that none of the major England stars will be available unless a gap can be made.\nRoy decided to make the move to Major League Cricket by sacrificing his England incremental contract and turning his back on the opportunity to play for his county Surrey for their Vitality Blast campaign. Roy is an extreme case and has made his intentions clear that he is a white-ball specialist, but the revitalisation of the England Test team under Ben Stokes may result in players opting to make themselves available for all red-ball matches in the future.\nThe likes of Stokes, Harry Brook, Jonny Bairstow, and Mark Wood who specialise in both red-ball and white-ball formats will not turn their backs on their lucrative England contracts. So, there could be a problem attracting the top-tier English talent and whichever teams are touring England during their summer months, which coincide with the Major League Cricket season. Unless the campaign can be shifted to a more amenable period those players will not be available.\nEven the IPL has had its issues securing the best English talent, despite offering huge salaries.\nThere are other issues too. The Global T20 Canada is played at the same time, which steered a portion of players away from MLC north of the border, notably England opener Alex Hales among others from New Zealand such as Tim Southee and Colin de Grandhomme and West Indies’ superstar Chris Gayle.\nMajor League Cricket will need to open up lines of communication to prevent a crossover, allowing both competitions to take advantage of the top players that are available in the summer months.\nRoy’s example of tearing up his England contract to play in Major League Cricket is an interesting precedent, which may begin to rear its head across the sport. Mumbai Indians have already locked up players to represent their teams across all T20 competitions such as Dewald Brevis.\nRajasthan Royals are looking to follow suit by tempting Jos Buttler with a four-year contract that would secure the England white-ball captain’s services for the IPL and their other franchises Paarl Royals in SA20 and the Barbados Royals in the Caribbean Premier League. Jofra Archer is another player who has reportedly been offered a lucrative deal by Mumbai Indians.\nIf players were to accept those contracts it would threaten to tear up the fabric of the game as countries would be forced to ask permission of franchises to allow their players to represent their nations. It is undoubtedly an exciting time in cricket, and although there have only been a few players to take the plunge and accept franchise-only deals at the moment, there may come a time when it spreads throughout the game.\nNew Zealand’s Trent Boult opted to take a step back from international cricket, while numerous other players are considering rationing their availability for all formats amid the packed schedule.\nThese contracts could work in the favour of Major League Cricket because of the six teams’ affiliation with their IPL partners. If Archer were to sign with the Indians, he would be available to play for MI New York instead of featuring for England in their summer. It would be at Archer’s discretion what team to choose.\nWe’re just entering the infancy of these contracts, but outside of the big three nations of India, Australia, and England, international teams are struggling to match the financial packages that can be provided to players from franchise cricket in all corners of the globe.\nThe MLC and other leagues could soon be flooded with superstars from around the world that will focus on T20 competitions rather than all formats.\nMajor League Cricket has arrived at a pivotal moment in the history of the game, and its development could well dictate the future of how players are handled between the franchise revolution and the status quo of the international game.\nHowever, there are issues that need to be addressed, notably whether MLC is just a novelty for an American audience and interest could quickly wane after a couple of seasons. It may also need to work on its place in the cricketing calendar to avoid other major competitions, especially in England, where luring stars could further boost its profile.\nThe first season has been a success commercially and it has the chance to be a building block for a permanent place in the US sporting zeitgeist.\nNinety per cent of people in the stands were south Asian.  MLC has reached two per cent of Americans.  It has not reached the other 98. How is this a “success”?\nComment by Tim johnson | 3:46pm BST 31 July 2023\nIf so, please register your details here, and one of our management team will be in touch."

  "body": "Major League Cricket has arrived in Dallas, and it rules. The atmosphere is electric, the players are world-class, the stadium is comfortable, and the game itself—well, it’s fast-paced, and I’m starting to understand it. As a food writer, of course, I was attracted to another aspect of the experience: the concession stands, which sell South Asian food and drinks.\nThe playoffs are coming up this week, in four games: day and night games this Thursday, a Friday night matchup, and a Sunday night championship. Here’s what to eat and drink when you go.\nAll the concessions at Grand Prairie Stadium are operated by a local mini-chain called Foodistaan. Foodistaan’s first location opened in Irving in early 2022; now it’s got a second location in Southlake and plans to debut soon in Frisco and Cedar Park (outside Austin). Four restaurants and a whole darn stadium is an ambitious expansion in less than a year and a half. But, based on our stadium experience, Foodistaan is handling it pretty well.\nThe menu includes South Asian appetizers—samosas, chili garlic fries, and bagged snacks—along with American ballpark staples like nachos and popcorn. Chicken and veggie burgers are available (not beef), and chicken wings, too.\nWe thought the wings were ordinary, but the potato and pea samosas were stars. Ballpark samosas have no right to be this good: full of flavor and seasoning, with fresher pastry than some I’ve had in actual restaurants. One guy in front of us in line carried away a paper boat of six samosas.\nWhen we picked up our samosa order, the man at the counter pointed and told me, “The ketchup’s over there.” So I dutifully dunked a bit of samosa in ketchup. I’d never done it before, but it turns out that if you start with a spicy enough samosa, it’s not bad with ketchup. (The stadium also stocks packets of mustard, relish, mayo, and tamarind chutney.)\nThe big-ticket items, at $20, are takeout trays of biryani, the dish of long-grained rice, spices, and (here) your choice of veggies or boneless chicken. We passed our chicken biryani back and forth—it’s big enough for a group of four—and let the rolling heat pass over our tongues.\nBeers are $8—except for Arka, an Indian-style lager with rice added, which is $7. It’s light, malty, and easy to drink. There’s not a lot of information about Arka online, but based on the bottle label and some information I dug up online, it appears to be contract-brewed at the Abita Brewing Company facilities in Louisiana. It comes in glass bottles, which stadium staff pour out into red plastic cups.\nAt the concession stall behind our section, a lot of items were already sold out or unavailable. I was ready to take down some chili garlic fries. Maybe next time. In theory, all of Foodistaan’s stalls carry the same menu. Make no mistake: we’ll be back, and we’ll go hungry. Major League Cricket is serving up a good experience—and that includes the stadium food.\nGrand Prairie Stadium, 1600 Lone Star Pkwy., Grand Prairie.\nAttractions\nBars and Clubs\nShops\nRestaurants\n\n750 North St.Paul St.\nSuite 2100\nDallas, Texas 75201\n\n\nTel: 214.939.3636\n \nFax: 214.748.4579\n"

Get features like\nCricket is set to return to the United States of America, and what better way to celebrate the momentous occasion by brining together some of the biggest stars under one roof. Welcome to the inaugural edition of the USA Major League Cricket – the first-ever global T20 league in the country. The USA has seen some classic global match-ups earlier – such as the Indian cricket team playing in Lauderhill, Florida or the widely celebrated three-match charity series between Sachin's Blasters and Warne's Warriors in 2015. However, the MLC promises to overshadow it as six star-studded teams in Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, San Francisco Unicorns, MI New York, Washington Freedom and Seattle Orcas battle for bragging rights. With less than eight hours to go for the opener between Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders, here is all you need to know about the much-anticipated T20 extravaganza.\nSuperstar players set to take part in MLC include Afghanistan T20 captain Rashid Khan, Pakistan's Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf, South African internationals Faf du Plessis and David Miller, West Indians Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell, Australians Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch, England's Jason Roy and New Zealand's Trent Boult.\nMajor League Cricket announced today a line-up of illustrious announcers from across the globe, bringing a rich range of international cricket experience to give colour to broadcasts showcasing the historic season. The commentary team includes the legendary Sunil Gavaskar (India), one of the greatest batters of all-time, former South Africa captain Graeme Smith, former New Zealand international Danny Morrison and former Zimbabwe international Mpumelelo Mbangwa. Experienced announcers Natalie Germanos (South Africa) and Alan Wilkins (Wales) along with rising star Nikhil Uttamchandani (Barbados) complete the line-up.\nMLC will feature top-class international talent playing alongside America's best players, with 19 games scheduled to take place. The inaugural season will be played in a round-robin format with the four best performing teams competing in a multi-game playoff and final round to decide a champion, to be crowned on July 30.\nFaf du Plessis, Texas Super Kings Captain: The stadium looks beautiful. Walking into the stadium it was amazing to see how much work has gone into getting it ready. The outfield looks green and lush. The pitches were really good and impressive. From that perspective, the tournament is already impressive. I see myself, in 10 or 15 years, coming into American sports and you can see the American feel watching the game of cricket which is unique to anywhere else in the world.”\nAaron Finch, San Francisco Unicorns Captain: \"We are blown away about the amount of people that turned up for our fan day. Having the opportunity to speak to young cricketers was brilliant. The ability to grow the game in this part of the world and hopefully fast track the next generation of players to become world class players in these facilities is unbelievable. So I think that is our role for us and this competition.\"\nMoises Henriques, Washington Freedom Captain: \"I'm excited to get out there and play. The standard of the international players is amazing but I think what is going to be great for this tournament and country moving forward is the influence on the local talent. If you ask anyone in the world it is the local talent that wins you tournaments in this type of T20 tournament.\"\nSunil Narine, Los Angeles Knight Riders Captain: \"Based on how much cricket has been played here, it will be high quality with all these international players feeding information to the youngsters – it will grow from strength to strength.\"\nWayne Parnell, Seattle Orcas Captain: \"Being in America, it is a land for dreamers. For us as international cricketers in America, it is our duty to promote the game in America and make sure over the next five to 10 years it takes off. A lot of expats play the game, but to get the Americans who were born and bred here, it is vital.\"\nKieron Pollard, MI New York Captain: \"From an MI Perspective, we look at new talent and are able to scout those international players and when we look at it and go around the world in each tournament, the most important people are the domestic talent.\"\nMajor League Cricket's six teams each added a tenth domestic-based player to their rosters following the MLC Domestic Wildcard Draft held on Monday, July 3. The selections provide a further opportunity for domestic players to participate in America's new professional franchise cricket league, taking place from July 13-30 in North Texas and North Carolina All six players drafted have taken part in Minor League Cricket, the leading pathway competition in the United States, with four of the wildcard picks having represented the United States National Team in international play. Here are the six picks\n1 Mohammad Mohsin – Texas Super Kings\n2 Gajanand Singh – Los Angeles Knight Riders\n3 Amila Aponso – San Francisco Unicorns\n4 Jasdeep Singh – MI New York\n5 Usman Rafiq – Washington Freedom\n6 Nisarg Patel – Seattle Orcas\nMLC's highly anticipated Opening Night of its inaugural season is finally here. Tonight's match between the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders will kick off a new era of cricket with the launch of America's new professional cricket league.

  "body": "Cricket was the USA's national game once upon a time, and the nation also served as the birthplace of the sport's very first international match. It may sound like an unbelievable story, but the historic encounter between the United States and Canada took place in none other than the city of New York.\nIn 1844, an enthusiastic crowd of 10,000 spectators gathered at NYC's Bloomingdale Park to witness this momentous event. Cricket's roots had firmly planted themselves on the American soil, captivating the imaginations of enthusiasts. However, as the years passed, it faded into the background, overshadowed by the rise of other popular sports such as baseball and basketball.\nBut now, a new chapter in American cricket is being written as Major League Cricket arrives in the Lone Star State of Texas. The question on everyone's lips is whether this sport, with its rich history, can once again capture the hearts and minds of the American people.\nWhile crowds may not immediately pack the stadiums to the rafters, the Major League Cricket is fresh and holds the promise of rekindling the nation's forgotten love for the game. With its strategic location, diverse population, and a renewed interest in embracing different sports, Texas serves as the ideal backdrop for this cricketing revival.\nInstagram Post\nAs the bat meets the ball on the American soil once again, Major League Cricket aims to capture the essence of the sport's glory days, injecting it with a fresh and modern twist. By showcasing the skills and talents of international players alongside a crop of promising American cricketing talent, the league seeks to establish a new era of cricketing excellence and fan engagement in the United States.\nThe rapid and action-packed T20 cricket format has gained immense popularity through franchise leagues in various countries like Pakistan, Australia, the Caribbean, and England. However, the crown jewel is undoubtedly the Indian Premier League (IPL), which recently emerged as the most-watched digital sports event worldwide.\nWith its extravagant success, the IPL has become a multi-million dollar powerhouse. It generates broadcasting fees exceeding $15 million per match and has positioned itself as the second richest league globally, second only to the NFL.\nThe IPL owes much of its financial strength to significant investments from American stakeholders such as Silver Lake Partners, TPG Capital, and KKR \u0026 Co. This infusion of capital has propelled the league's growth, transforming it into a desirable product to emulate.\nThe three-hour matches, packed with colossal sixes, top-tier talent from around the world, captivating on-field entertainment, and cutting-edge technology showcased in impressive stadiums, have contributed to its mass appeal.\nNow, Major League Cricket finds itself in a similar position, armed with substantial financial backing. The next steps involve creating a compelling visual experience, establishing state-of-the-art facilities, and building a dedicated fanbase.\nThe tournament is a collaborative effort between The Times of India Group, the country's largest media conglomerate, and has garnered substantial initial funding of $120 million (£94m). This impressive financial backing includes prominent figures such as Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft.\nCricket's global landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation with a gradual shift towards franchise-based cricket. This could mark a groundbreaking turning point with the introduction of the Indian Premier League's (IPL) franchises into the United States through the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) edition.\nThe impact of this development cannot be overstated, as four of the six MLC franchises have already been taken over or received significant investments from IPL giants. Kolkata Knight Riders have set their sights on Los Angeles, Chennai Super Kings are expanding to Texas, Mumbai Indians are making their mark in New York, and Delhi Capitals have found a home in Seattle as the Seattle Orcas.\nSuch a move is set to reshape the cricketing ecosystem permanently, attracting new audiences, and enhancing the sport's global appeal. The participation of IPL franchises in MLC brings a wealth of experience, star players, and a passionate fanbase, which is sure to create a thrilling and engaging cricketing spectacle.\nEven the remaining two franchises, namely Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns, though not directly affiliated with the IPL, still have strong connections with Indian roots. San Francisco Unicorns boast top investors in Venture Capitalists Venky Hariharan and Anand Rajaraman, who have secured the involvement of Australian state side Victoria, adding an international dimension to their lineup.\nSimilarly, Washington Freedom is owned by Indian American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil, who has partnered with the New South Wales state cricket body from Australia. This infusion of diverse backgrounds and expertise will undoubtedly enrich the cricketing experience for players and fans alike.\nAnd let's not forget the star power involved. The Seattle franchise's inclusion of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella as one of the investors adds a touch of tech and glamor to the mix, further fueling excitement and interest in the league.\nAs cricket enthusiasts eagerly await the kickoff of Major League Cricket with these influential franchises on board, it's clear that the sport's future is set to be more enthralling and diverse than ever before. \nThe fusion of Indian cricketing prowess, international partnerships, and high-profile investors is a recipe for success, promising a new era for the sport on a global scale. The world of cricket is in for a thrilling ride as it embraces this bold and exciting evolution.\nCricket has been played in the United States for many years, but it has traditionally been a niche sport with a relatively small following, compared to those like baseball, American football, basketball, and soccer. Major League Cricket (MLC) is a professional cricket league that aims to promote and popularize the sport in the United States.\nMajor League Cricket's success and popularity will depend on several factors. These include its efforts to market and promote the sport effectively, the quality of play and competition, the accessibility of cricket facilities, and the level of interest among the American population.\nCricket faces significant challenges in breaking into the mainstream sports market in the United States due to the dominance of other established sports. However, there has been some growth in its popularity in recent years. This is driven by an increase in immigrant populations from cricket-playing countries and the efforts to develop cricket infrastructure and grassroots programs.\nIf Major League Cricket can capitalize on these trends, generate a strong fanbase, secure media coverage, and attract talented players, it could have a chance of gaining popularity in America. However, it will likely take time and sustained efforts to establish itself as a major sport in the country.\nUltimately, Major League Cricket's future popularity in America will depend on its ability and stakeholders to overcome the challenges and generate widespread interest and support for the sport.\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) has the potential to revolutionize cricket in the United States. With its ambitious plans to establish a professional league and promote the game at the grassroots level, MLC aims to introduce cricket to a wider audience and create a thriving cricket culture in the country.\nThe league's focus on engaging local communities, developing young talent, and fostering international collaborations demonstrates its commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.\n\nAs MLC gains momentum and attracts top players from around the world, it has the opportunity to establish itself as a prominent cricket league on the global stage. With its innovative approach and unwavering passion for the game, Major League Cricket is poised to make a significant impact and reshape the cricket landscape in the United States.\nQuick Links\n\nBe the first one to comment on this story"

  "body": "It’s July 13 in sunny Dallas, Texas and that means it’s finally time for Major League Cricket. The inaugural game features Ali Khan and the Los Angeles Knight Riders against Rusty Theron and the Texas Super Kings at 7:30pm local time. The international stars of MLC are well known by cricket fans around the world, so let’s take a look at the domestics who live and play right here in the USA.\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\nOne of the things I love about this team is that their acronym is two letters shy of Lakers. That begs the question: Who is the Magic Johnson of the Knight Riders? This team is packed with an exciting variety of dynamic domestics. Let’s take a look at how each might factor into LAKR plans.\nAli Khan is the most internationally famous American product since Bart King at the turn of the 20th century. A veteran of the T20 franchise cricket circuit, Ali is also a major star for USA Cricket. Known by many as the “Yorker King,” Ali specializes in bowling the most difficult lengths for batters and consistently comes through in the toughest moments for his team. If Ali can claim wickets early, it will set the stage nicely for international stars Lockie Ferguson and Adam Zampa at the end of the power play and into the middle overs.\nJaskaran Malholtra almost certainly finds himself as the team’s wicket keeper, as no overseas options are included in the team. A world record holder, along with three others for smashing six consecutive sixes in an international over, Jaskaran is also featured in Jomboy Media’s ongoing Ball In Play League, an indoor hybrid of cricket and baseball designed in part to teach cricket to baseball fans.\nUnmukt Chand is well known for helping India claim the 2012 U19 World Cup, but his record in Minor League Cricket has shown that he still has a knack for winning big games. Unmukt captained the Silicon Valley Strikers to the championship in 2021 and back into finals weekend in 2022. Unmukt is also the career leader in runs for Minor League Cricket. It appears as if Unmukt will open the season in the playing eleven and serve as LAKR’s backup wicket keeper, should Jaskaran not perform.\nA fast bowling all rounder position will most likely be filled by a domestic as well, and LAKR have three strong options. \nSteady veteran Shadley Van Schalkwyk, a true all rounder for the Minor League Champion Seattle Thunderbolts, is the most balanced of LAKR’s options. Shadley possesses the experience and the mentality required to bowl reliably in the death, and would be a steadying presence in the late middle/early tail of the batting from the left side. \nCorne Dry brings a lot with the ball, as he’s shown for two seasons in Minor League Cricket leading the way for the South Division’s top team, the Atlanta Fire. The tall right arm quick can also put the ball into the seats with the bat. \nBhaskar Yadram is a true powerhouse with the bat, blasting sixes as far as you’ll see anybody hit them. With the ball, he almost bowls off of the wrong foot, but is effective and skillful. Though not the swiftest in the field, the U23 selection has a bright future ahead of him and is too talented to hold back for long. \nAlong with the splendid balance of Zampa and Narine, LAKR might want to add another spin option in their opening game against TSK. Luckily, they’ll have a good variety of spin styles to choose from domestically.\nUSA U19 all rounder Ali Sheikh’s tremendous performance in the draft combine resulted in his name being called before the U23 round, bringing attention to the young talent which abounds in the USA. Ali’s athleticism and effort in the field are difficult to match, and his left-arm finger spin bowling gives LAKR another bowler to trouble right handed batters. \nWith so many quality left handed batters in the TSK lineup, don’t be surprised to see Nitish Kumar in the team. The former Canadian Captain moved to Texas in 2021 and though his primary role is as a top order batter, Kumar is a solid right arm off spin option. \nTop order batter Saif Badar, who moved to the USA from Pakistan recently, could also be used as a legbreak option if LAKR opt for his bat in the team. \nGajanand Singh is coming off of his first ever ODI Century for USA, one of the few bright spots of the World Cup Qualifier tour. Gaj gives LAKR a left hand batting option in the middle of the order, and some handy off break bowling if needed. \nPredicted in the XI: Ali Khan, Jaskaran Malholtra, Unmukt Chand, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Nitish Kumar \nTexas Super Kings – \nEssentially playing at home, as well as being part of the most followed Franchise cricket brand in the world, TSK should have immense fan support at Grand Prairie Stadium on opening night. \nThe Super Kings first pick in the domestic draft, few cricketers enjoy the spotlight more than Rusty. While the pick surprised many, as Rusty has withdrawn himself from availability in recent tours for USA, it makes good sense when the brevity of the tournament and scarcity of quality fast bowling domestic options is taken into account. \nFast bowling all rounder Calvin Savage lives up to his surname in the T20 format. A knack for early wickets with the ball, Calvin sets up his slower ball well. As captain, Calvin led the unlikely Chicago Tigers to the Minor League playoffs in 2022, where the defending champion Silicon Valley Strikers needed all three games of the Conference Semifinal to knock them out. Calvin’s big bat is a major bonus and puts him in rare air among American all rounders. Along with Rusty and Jaskaran, Calvin also features in Jomboy’s Ball In Play League. \nPossessing perhaps the best gloves in the USA, wicket keeper Lahiru Milantha also brings a versatile, aggressive left handed bat to the TSK order. Able to take advantage in the power play, or finesse and punish spinners in the middle overs, Lahiru never looks outmatched by pace or spin. \nSkillfully finding gaps, especially to the off side and behind point, Sami Aslam’s batting more closely resembles swordplay than the violent ball bashing that dominates T20 cricket. But when he’s unburdened by the responsibility of leading a team, Sami’s scoring rate climbs and his talent for the format shines. \nWill TSK play both of these talented left handed batters, or will opt for a right handed domestic batter to balance out the order, considering LAKR’s versatile and varied bowling attack? \nMilind Kumar was one of the top performers in the East division of Minor League Cricket in 2022. Able to accumulate and score quickly, Milind can bat in the middle overs and handles spin bowling very well. He also provides TSK the option for right arm off break with the ball, if necessary. \nCody Chetty brings versatility from the right side to TSK, as he can bat at the top or middle order. Though he doesn’t bowl often at higher levels, he can provide an over or two of off break bowling if needed. \nWith the recently announced arrival of legbreak legend lImran Tahir, and Mitchell Santner already in the roster, the question of how many domestic spin options TSK include is an interesting one. \nBy taking Mohammad Mohsin in the recent “wildcard” domestic draft, TSK could be signaling the desire to double down on spin that turns away from right handed batters.\nZia Shahzad was taken in the initial domestic draft, an all rounder who is possibly the top right arm legbreak spin bowler in the country, and so the edge would logically go to him to start the tournament. Shahzad should gain eligibility to play for USA this year. \nConsidering the inclusion of Dwayne Bravo, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee as overseas in the roster, it seems unlikely that right arm fast medium bowler Cam Stevenson would be in the same eleven along with Calvin and Rusty. But that doesn’t mean Stevenson won’t be included in place of one of his domestic teammates. Cam has been reliable in his role with USA cricket and has experience in T20 franchise in the BBL. \nAnd that leaves Saiteja Mukkamalla. There is perhaps no better young batting prospect in the country than TSK’s U23. USA Cricket’s youngest centurion, Sai is mature beyond his years and opened the batting for his New Jersey Stallions on their way to back to back finals weekend appearances in 2021 and 2022. \nPredicted in the XI: Rusty Theron, Calvin Savage, Lahiru Milantha, Zia Shahzad, Milind Kumar \nHow to watch\nFans in the USA can watch Major League Cricket by subscribing to Willow TV.\n \nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nPlease enter an answer in digits:\n\n \n\n\n© Emerging Cricket 2021"

  "body": "The latest T20 league to be launched, the USA-based Major League Cricket, has attracted a number of international stars but will operate without official status.\nWithout official T20 status, the records achieved by the players during the tournament will not be reflected in their career stats. Even if Andre Russell scores the fastest T20 hundred in the edition or Anrich Nortje registers his career-best figures, the feats will be relegated to the “miscellaneous” or the “other T20” section in the database of the statisticians.\nThe Major League Cricket has been sanctioned by USA Cricket after initial disputes with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the league’s organisers. Soon after the country’s official administrative body approved the league, the International Cricket Council sanctioned the league as well. The stamp of approval by the ICC allowed the Full Members to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to their players to participate in the league.\nIf the league had not been sanctioned by the ICC, it would have been termed Disapproved Cricket, with Members requested not to provide NOCs to their cricketers.\nAny tournament that does not adhere to ICC’s guidelines is an unsanctioned league. Players who take part in such events can face consequences, varying from fines to lifetime bans. The Indian Cricket League, held between 2007 and 2009, was termed a “rebel league” with all players being banned from other events.\nThe ICC can approve leagues anywhere in the world if the formalities are in order as per the Regulations on Sanctioning of Cricket Events. However, a nod of approval by the ICC only means that players from across the world can take part in the tournament without the fear of being debarred.\nOn the other hand, a league is given official status only if it is hosted by a Full Member country. The ICC regulations state that sanctioned events hosted by non-Full Member countries cannot have stats and records attributed to them.\nAs the MLC is being held in the USA, an Associate country, it does not have official status. The lack of official status does not mean that the MLC is not a legitimate tournament. It simply means that the records achieved by the players during the tournament will not be counted towards their career statistics.\nA number of T10 leagues in the world do not have official status, including the Abu Dhabi T10 League or the upcoming US Masters T10 League.\nThe Global T20 Canada, which was held in 2018 and 2019, did not have official status, and neither did this year’s ILT20, which was hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a non-Full-Member country.\nIn the women’s game, the Fairbreak Invitational Tournament, an event run by a club in Hong Kong, is sanctioned by the ICC but is not recognised as an official competition statistically.\nIf you enjoyed this story, please share with your fellow cricket fans and team-mates\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n12 Issues for just £39.99\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox.\n\"It's such a lame excuse\"\nFollow on:\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox."

  "body": "Z is for Zampa. Z is also for zany. Australian cricket star Adam Zampa has attracted instant headlines for America’s fledgling Major League Cricket competition - and it had nothing to do with what he did with bat or ball.\nThe extroverted Aussie leg spinner instead caused a storm with his choice of number on the back of his LA Knight Riders’ playing shirt. Zampa opted for number 420 - presumably as a reference to marijuana - for the match against the Texas Super Kings.\n'SURPRISED': Alex Carey's telling response to Jonny Bairstow Ashes outrage\nCLASSIC: Mitchell Starc's hilarious Alyssa Healy reveal amid Ashes battle\nHUGE: Michael Neser puts Ashes selectors on notice in astonishing feat\nThe origins of 420 are a little murky, with one suggestion it was the police radio call used for any dope related offence in the US. Another explanation is it’s the room number the Grateful Dead insisted on staying in during their touring days.\nA more plausible reason is it’s the codename a bunch of schoolboys gave their group in 1971 after discovering a marijuana crop in San Francisco. The boys would meet after school at 4:20pm, hence the tag.\nEvery year around the world, marijuana enthusiasts meet on April 20 (4/20 on the American calendar) to celebrate their love of weed and push for its decriminalisation. Zampa has not publicly declared why he chose shirt number 420 but fans have decided it’s his way of bringing a bit of life and colour to the American tournament.\nIt certainly became a major talking point. Fans from around the cricket world took to social media to speculate about Zampa’s motives for using 420.\nAdam Zampa is throwing his apparently throwing some not so subtle support behind efforts to get cannabis legalized in Texas.

  "body": "The inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket competition has got underway in the United States of America, with the first leg of the matches being played out at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\nA lot of impressive performances have already been on display, with some of them quite frankly taking our breath away. The standard of the game has been phenomenal.\nMI New York and Texas Super Kings have dominated the competition so far, with the likes of Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom coming into their own as well. Los Angeles Knight Riders, a subsidiary of Kolkata Knight Riders of the Indian Premier League, have had perhaps the worst showing so far, losing both the matches that they have played and that too by big margins.\nA lot of local American players have caught our eye, too. Since this tournament is, in a way, meant to provide them with a pathway and help them develop, we have compiled a listicle of three such names who have impressed us the most.\nHere are three local players to watch out for in Major League Cricket 2023.\nExpress fast bowler Ali Khan, who turns out for the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the competition, is one of the brightest stars of American cricket. Known to possess decent pace, Khan can swing the ball too, often getting it to angle across the right-handers who come across him.\nKhan can also bowl yorkers consistently, and this is what makes him different from others of his ilk. He has picked up four wickets so far in the competition, having bagged a couple of wickets each in the two games that the Knight Riders have played so far, against the Texas Super Kings and MI New York.\nDespite his team doing poorly in this competition, Khan has done well individually. He has been seen hurrying the batters for pace, and with the prized scalp of Nicholas Pooran in his pocket, his confidence is only bound to soar further.\nMI New York have had a poor start to this competition so far, winning one and losing two. Although he was not a part of their first game against San Francisco, Shayan Jahangir found his way into the team for the next two matches.\nHe failed to perform against Los Angeles Knight Riders but scored a fabulous 41 against Texas Super Kings. Born in Karachi, Pakistan, Jahangir is the regular wicketkeeper for the USA national team but plays as a batter in MLC, given the presence of Nicholas Pooran behind the stumps.\nA calm presence at the crease, Jahangir did well in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifiers held recently in Zimbabwe, with a brilliant century against Nepal being the icing on the cake. His ability to use his feet against the spinners has often come in handy in MLC.\nIf Jahangir continues in this vein of form, MI New York's batting worries might be solved very soon.\nOne of the biggest stories of the inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket competition is that of Mohammad Mohsin.\nLeft out of the initial draft, Mohsin was disappointed but managed to keep a smile on his face. He was picked up by the Texas Super Kings in the wildcard round just seven days before the tournament began, and now has seven wickets to his name! He is also the leading wicket-taker of the tournament at the time of writing.\nMohsin starred in his debut game itself, picking up 4/8 against Los Angeles Knight Riders, and followed it up with 1/28 against Washington Freedom and 2/36 against MI New York. His captain Faf du Plessis is extremely pleased with him, owing to the wide variety of tricks the leg-spinner has in his bag.\nBorn in Peshawar, Pakistan, Mohsin has played seven first-class matches and an equal number of List A games. Watching a leggie is always easy on the eye, and that is especially the case with Mohsin. With impeccable control over his length and drift, he can go on to achieve a lot of big things.\nCheck out India Squad for World Cup 2023 \u0026 South Africa Squad for World Cup 2023.

  "body": "It’s Faf du Plessis on strike as the famous Bollywood song Aaj ki party blares from the loudspeaker and a tantalising aroma of spices fills the air while the spectators — holding love for cricket in their hearts and biryani in their trays — roam around trying to get to their seats.\nThe setting has all the makings of a cricket match in India or Pakistan but if that’s your guess, you’ve got the geography completely wrong.\nIn the outskirts of Dallas, Texas lies a city named Grand Prairie that many have not heard of, and likewise is the town named Morrisville in North Carolina. One thing common between the two places is that they co-hosted United States’ first franchised T20 league, which came to an end on Monday with the victory of MI New York.\nCricket in the land of baseball, and that too at two lesser known venues could give sceptics the reason to doubt if the twin experiments would work. However, the heart pounding cricket encounters that displayed the determination of players to the electrifying music that resonated with the rhythm of the crowd, Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park turned cricket’s American dream into reality.\n“It is in our blood, us Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, cricket is in our blood,” said Swethan Srinivasan, executive committee member of Triangular Cricket League (TCL) in Morrisville.\nTCL is a non-profit organization that aims to promote the game in North Carolina among both adults and youth.\nIt started as a recreational league for adults to play cricket but now boasts multiple youth programs with a coaching staff that has produced many players for the U-19 national team in the US.\nIt also contributed to getting the Church Street Park facility built, which has hosted many notable events, including the 2018 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Americas Qualifiers and Minor League Cricket.\nSwethan, who is originally from Chennai and has been in the US for last sixteen years, works tirelessly as a volunteer to help cricket grow merely out of his love for the game that roots back to his time in his home country.\n“Everybody is a volunteer here and nobody gets paid except for some of our employed coaches. All the management and people who do other various things are volunteers.”\nThe love for cricket among South Asians runs deep and transcends boundaries, encompassing national pride, communal celebration, and a sense of identity that unites millions under one captivating bat and ball symphony.\n“I am supporting the team with Haris Rauf and Shadab Khan because I am very very Pakistani,” said Memhudah Rehman while holding a Pakistani flag during San Francisco Unicorns’ match against Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium on Tuesday.\n    \n\nRehman, who is originally from Karachi, lives in Dubai and was in the US to visit her family in New York. They travelled all the way from the east coast to Texas only to watch an MLC match.\n“When I walked in here I got stunned; the vibe, the environment, the lighting, the stadium itself, there is (are) actually good pitches here, in America. I never thought I would see actual cricket pitches so it is really amazing and the turnout, it is not even the weekend night. It is crazy,” she said excitedly as flocks of people moved by.\nMLC is first of its kind T20 franchise marquee event in the country featuring six teams and numerous international stars including Rashid Khan, Andre Russell, Faf du Plessis, David Miller, Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Aaron Finch, Jason Roy, and many others.\nThe league is founded by Vijay Srinivasan and Sameer Mehta, co-founders of Willow TV, the largest broadcaster of cricket in North America.\n    \n\n“We wanted to prove that the US is capable of holding and staging an event of this stature and scale and I think we have accomplished that,” said Vijay, who grew up in Delhi and migrated to the States in 1989 for his undergraduate studies.\nHe has been involved in cricket in the country for over twenty years now.\n“I grew up in India, playing cricket and watching cricket.  It meant everything to me,” he said. “I have been very fortunate that I have been involved in cricket for a good part of my professional life through Willow and now through Major League Cricket and I’m very lucky that I have managed to make cricket part of my professional life and also my personal passion. Very few people are lucky that way.”\nThe businessman plans to grow the game in the US by bringing in international stars, building new stadiums and training facilities in hopes of growing domestic talent. The idea behind creating a cricket league in the US was also to bring the game closer to fans who never had the opportunity to watch their favorite stars here.\n“We have only managed to bring MLC to two cities so far but the response in both those cities has been amazing, and the fans have come out in huge numbers,” Vijay said. “We are really excited to bring this game here that so many fans  love and have grown up.”\nHamza Khan, a 12-year-old from Austin who plays cricket for Hill County Cricket Association, was sporting Pakistan’s cricket team jersey at Grand Prairie Stadium to show his support for Shadab Khan.\nIt was his first time watching a cricket match in the US. He previously traveled to England in 2019 to watch his favourite players play in Edgbaston during ICC Men’s ODI World Cup.\n“I am very happy that I have a chance to actually watch a game and I do not have to go to a different country like I did for the other match,” the 7th grader said. “It is my favorite sport; I really enjoy watching it. Some of my favorite players are here today.”\nIt was Texas Super Kings (TSK), however, whose fans outnumbered the fans of all other franchises. The Yellow Army supported the home team not only in Dallas, but showed up in huge numbers in North Carolina as well in bright yellow jerseys and their signature buckets hats as they waved TSK flags.\nBut one could have wondered if it really was Texas they were supporting or the popular Chennai-based franchise from the Indian Premier League. The suspicions grew as even when David Miller smacked sixes off Adam Zampa and Sunil Narine in the opening game, the crowd was busy chanting “Dhoni, Dhoni”.\n    \n\n“I am supporting TSK in the memory of MS Dhoni,” said Jisha Patel, who had come from Coppell to watch Texas play against MI New York with her family on Monday.\n“TSK is a part of CSK and Dhoni is a part of CSK so, me and family are really hoping that Dhoni would come and play for TSK,” said the 40-year-old, who was watching her first MLC match.  “If Dhoni comes, I would not miss a match.”\nWhile the US is known for its diversity, there was not much of it on display during the ongoing T20 tournament. From the investors to the crowd, from team owners to the players, from food vendors to event officials, a vast majority of it was formed by the South Asian diaspora.\nAs this budding love affair continues, and cricket’s roots dig deeper into the American soil, one could hope for an even more vibrant community that brings people together regardless of their cultural background.\nDear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.\nCopyright © 2023\nScribe Publishing Platform"

The six-team tournament will feature eight Indian players who have recently announced retirement from Indian cricket to pursue their cricketing careers in USA.\nSome of the prominent names are India U-19 World Cup-winning captain Unmukt Chand and his teammates Smit Patel and Harmeet Singh. Ambati Rayudu had signed up with Texas Super Kings but pulled out of the tournament last week due to personal reasons. \nActive Indian players are barred from playing in overseas franchise leagues, including MLC, but the ones who have announced their retirement are allowed. \nHere are the Indian players who will be in action in MLC 2023: \nThe former India Under-19 World Cup skipper was picked by Los Angeles Knight Riders for $65,000 in the MLC player draft. The right-handed batter had announced his retirement from Indian cricket in August 2021 and moved to the USA. \nChand had a brief stint in the Indian Premier League (IPL) between 2011 and 2016, where he played 21 matches for Delhi Capitals (2011-13), Rajasthan Royals (2014) and Mumbai Indians (2015-16). He had little success, however, scoring 300 runs at a strike rate of 100.00 and averaging 15.00. The Delhi-born batter has also played franchise cricket in Australia (Big Bash League) and Bangladesh (Bangladesh Premier League). \n\nDelhi batter Unmukt Chand in action against Andhra in the Vijay Hazare Trophy at Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi in 2018.\n| Photo Credit:\nSHIV KUMAR PUSHPAKAR\n\nUnmukt Chand T20 career stats \nChand’s 2012 Under-19 World Cup teammate was one of the six players to be picked in the first round of the MLC player draft for $75,000 by Seattle Orcas. The left-arm spinner has played just one IPL game, for Rajasthan Royals in 2013. He picked one for 34 from his four overs in his lone experience in the league. \nOnce compared to spin legend Bishen Singh Bedi, Harmeet made his First-Class debut for Mumbai in 2009 and picked seven wickets in the game against Himachal Pradesh. From 2017-18, he played for Tripura in the Indian domestic circuit till 2020 before retiring from Indian cricket in 2021 and moving to USA. \n\nHarmeet Singh (left) celebrates with his teammates after India defeated Australia in the U-19 Cricket World Cup final in Townsville.\n| Photo Credit:\nPTI\n\nHarmeet Singh T20 career stats \nThe wicketkeeper-batter also shot to fame during India’s Under-19 World Cup win in 2012 under the leadership of Chand. He was India’s second highest run-scorer in the tournament, after Chand, scoring 178 runs in six games at an average of 59.33. He made his First-Class debut for Gujarat in the same year before playing for Tripura as a “guest player” in search of more opportunities. He ended his First-Class career in 2020 with Goa with a game against his original team Gujarat. \nSmit ended his Indian domestic career with Baroda in 2021 before deciding to move to USA. In 2021, he plied his trade for Barbados Royals in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL). \n\nSmit Patel of India bats against Australia in the ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup final in Townsville.\n| Photo Credit:\nAP\n\nSmit Patel T20 career stats \nThe leg-spinner from Punjab has an impressive First-Class record with 89 wickets in just 28 games. Ladda made his debut in 2007 and was Punjab’s second highest wicket-taker in the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy season. He earned an IPL cap in 2010 with Delhi Capitals and picked four wickets in five games at an economy rate of 9.53 in his debut season. He then played three matches for Kolkata Knight Riders between 2011 and 2013 but managed just one wicket. \nHis last IPL appearance was for Gujarat Lions in 2016. He played just one match that season and was wicketless in the two overs that went for 21 runs. That was also his last T20 match. Ladda’s First-Class career ended in 2015 while his last List A game was back in 2010. \n\nSarbjeet Ladda (left) and Rajwinder Golu of Punjab during a Ranji Trophy cricket match against Andhra in Patiala in 2015.\n| Photo Credit:\nAKHILESH KUMAR\n\nSarbjeet Singh Ladda T20 career stats \nBishnoi played the most recent Indian domestic season, opening the batting for Haryana across formats. He was his side’s top run-scorer in the T20 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with 217 runs in eight matches but at an underwhelming strike rate of 104.32. In the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy, Bishnoi was Haryana’s third leading run-getter and scored 213 runs in six innings and also struck a hundred (134). In the Ranji Trophy, Bishnoi amassed 282 runs in eight innings, averaging 35.25 and picked three wickets with his left-arm spin. \nThe 28-year-old was bought by Chennai Super Kings for his base price of Rs. 20 lakh in 2018 and was retained by the side for the 2019 season but never played an IPL match. \n\nChaitanya Bishnoi in action.\n| Photo Credit:\nTHE HINDU\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi T20 career stats \nThe lower-order batter from Rajasthan has an impressive career strike rate of 144.16 in T20s and is also a handy off-spinner who has a career economy of 6.52 in the shortest format of the game. He was picked for Rs. 55 lakh by Mumbai Indians in the 2018 auctions before Punjab Kings acquired his services for Rs. 20 lakh in 2020. Despite his penchant for big-hitting, Tajinder never played an IPL match. He made his First-Class, List A and T20 debut for Rajasthan in 2017 and plied his trade in the Indian domestic circuit till 2019. \nTajinder Singh Dhillon T20 career stats \nMilind is a proven performer on the Indian domestic circuit. The all-rounder made his First-Class debut for Delhi in 2011 and has also represented Sikkim and Tripura in the Ranji Trophy. The right-handed batter amassed 1,331 runs for Sikkim in Ranji Trophy 2018-19 in the Plate Division, which is the third highest tally in a single season. In a testament to his all-round abilities, Milind also picked 22 wickets with his off-spin in the same season. The 32-year-old played his last game in Indian domestic cricket in 2021 for Tripura before announcing his retirement. \nThe Delhi-born all-rounder was picked by Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore but never made his IPL debut. Milind has an impressive average in First-Class and List A cricket, 46.68 and 43.04, respectively. In T20s, he has a strike rate of 112.32, which has surged to 142.97 in Minor League Cricket. \n\nDelhi’s Milind Kumar plays a shot on the third day of the Ranji Trophy Group B match against Orissa in Mohali in 2016.\n| Photo Credit:\nAKHILESH KUMAR\n\nMilind Kumar T20 career stats \nRanjane is of rich cricketing heritage. His grandfather Vasant played seven Test matches for India between 1958 and 1964 while his father Subash reperesented Maharashtra in 29 First-Class and 11 List A games. Following in his footsteps, Shubham played 15 First-Class, 23 List A and 29 T20 games for Maharashtra. The all-rounder is a handy lower-order batter and is economical with his right-arm medium pace. Ranjane ended his career in Indian cricket with Goa in 2022. He was picked by Rajasthan Royals in the 2019 auctions but never received an IPL cap. \n\nShubham Ranjane of Mumbai plays a shot during the Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Tamil Nadu in Kalavakkam near Chennai in 2018.\n| Photo Credit:\nK.

The Major League Cricket, operated by the American Cricket Enterprise (ACE) has been sanctioned by the USA Cricket. It has also been sanctioned by the International Cricket Council. However, the records accumulated by the players will not be reflected on their profiles as the USA is not a full member country.

Each team could only pick nine international stars, and they had to select at least one under-23 player from the USA. At least 10 domestic players also needed to be picked. In the final XIs, teams can select five domestic stars and six overseas players.\nIndia’s Unmukt Chand and Harmeet Singh, former under-19 stars, will take part in the 2023 MLC, as will Chaitanya Bishnoi, Tajinder Singh, Smit Patel and Shubham Ranjane. Ambati Rayudu, who announced his Indian domestic retirement in May, was also slated to take part but had to withdraw as the BCCI has introduced a year-long cooling-off period for recently retired players before they can play in T20 leagues abroad.\nCatch all matches live and exclusive across TV and Digital in the US and Canada with Willow.tv\nYou can bet on the 2023 Ashes with our Match Centre partners, bet365.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please share with your fellow cricket fans and team-mates\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n12 Issues for just £39.99\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox.\n\"It's such a lame excuse\"\nFollow on:\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox."

Now, he is about to play in his 11th: Major League Cricket, the first major T20 league in the United States. The tournament launched in the early hours of Friday morning, when Texas Super Kings beat Los Angeles Knight Riders in front of a sold-out 7,000 crowd at a converted baseball stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\nThe team names on opening night - the Super Kings and Knight Riders - reflect the involvement of the Indian Premier League in Major League Cricket. IPL owners own four of the MLC teams - including MI New York, who are named after Mumbai Indians are will play in the same blue kit, whom Pollard will captain.\n“All the excitement is there,” he says. “Getting people to come out and understand what’s cricket about in America had different challenges before with different tournaments. But this one, with the backing of the Indian franchises - they understand what needs to be done for a tournament to be successful.”\nPollard has played in the US before for West Indies against India and in the Caribbean Premier League, at Fort Lauderdale in Florida. Though the India matches attracted sell-out crowds, the CPL games suffered underwhelming crowds, with fans put off by a lack of shade on suffocatingly hot days.\nYet this time, Pollard, believes, will be different. The creation of Minor League Cricket, a feeder league for MLC, two years ago has helped to begin the long process of nurturing American talent. The involvement of IPL franchises also gives MLC greater credibility. It has also ensured that MLC’s raft of overseas players is more impressive than the Hundred: Jason Roy, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway are among those playing, earning salaries up to £135,000 for the 18-day tournament.\nNo league, Pollard is sure, will compete with the behemoth of the IPL. But he believes that MLC can slot into the next tier of leagues.\n“I don’t think any one of the leagues can rival the IPL if it was very, very honest. With the right structures in place, I think they can be a force to be reckoned with because American sports is big in the world.”\nPollard knows the pitfalls of T20 leagues better than most. He played in the Global T20 Canada in 2018, which was since scrapped because of funding problems, and has seen a host of mooted T20 leagues never even make it to the first ball. The involvement of IPL owners - the two other franchises have investment from Cricket New South Wales and Cricket Victoria - gives him confidence that MLC will prove altogether more sustainable.\n“It’s about the future,” he says. “It is not just ‘put on a league I want to make a quick buck’. You just want to go there for the long haul, understanding the dynamics of the country, understanding who and what is needed to run the league for a period of time, the quality of the cricket, the quality of the overseas stars, the template of the tournament, and what you’re trying to achieve.\n“Hopefully with the influence of the IPL franchises, which have been successful for the last 15 years, they understand the model and it continues to grow.”\nFew players grasp this like Pollard, who has played more T20 matches than anyone in history and - now a coach in the IPL, but a player everywhere else - is gently winding down his remarkable career. Even more than his one T20 World Cup in 2012, and five IPL crowns with Mumbai Indians, Pollard’s greatest legacy is as a pioneer.\nIn 2010, Pollard rejected a central contract from West Indies to play with Somerset in the T20 Blast instead - effectively, choosing to become a freelance cricketer. One West Indies administrator asked Pollard: “Do you want to be remembered as a legend or do you want to be remembered as someone who is a mercenary?”\nNow, of course, administrators are rather more enlightened when players - as Pollard did - make decisions based on what is best for their families. When Jason Roy opted out of his England contract to play in this season’s MLC, England immediately clarified that the decision would not affect their willingness to pick him for international cricket.\nPollard stresses, “I’ve never turned down playing for West Indies to play franchise cricket.” Indeed, he played 224 times for West Indies across the two white-ball formats, including a stint as captain from 2019-22.\n“Hopefully one day they realise the mistakes they’ve made with the words that they chose,” Pollard reflects of how his embrace of freelance life was viewed. When it is put to him that he was ahead of his time, he says: “we understood the nature of where the sport was going and how things were happening, especially in the Caribbean.\n“Now I sit back and I see it’s the way of the world. Because as individuals, we have short careers and you have to think about the future and think about what’s right in front of you.”\nWhile Pollard grew up hoping to play Test cricket and actually has a far better first-class average - 37.7 - than many West Indies batsmen picked in recent years, he is fully content with how his career panned out. “I look at things as what is to be will be - and that was something that was not meant to be. I don’t actually lose sleep over it. It didn’t happen due to different circumstances.”\nAs West Indies white-ball captain until last year, Pollard still believes that the side can chart a way forward after the debacle of failing to qualify for this year’s ODI World Cup. It needs “everybody coming together,” he says. “The right thinking, the right people, the right strategy, the right plan, and the dedication.\n“There’s still a lot of people interested in playing cricket there’s still a lot of youngsters I see them. I interact with them. They need a right and clear pathway in order for that to happen.” For most young Caribbean cricketers, the template of Pollard’s career is altogether more relevant than that of the magnificent generation of Test players in the 1980s.\nPollard was one of the very first to spot where the game was heading; his career responded to - and then accelerated - these shifts. To him, MLC is merely another sign of cricket’s continued move towards a structure more like football, with the game revolving more around domestic leagues than the international game.\n“I think it’ll carry on going more to franchise cricket,” he reflects. “The leagues and the franchises are going to have a lot more influence - because you have leagues basically 12 months a year.”\n“I’m happy it has gotten to this stage and people have realised that T20 cricket is actually here to stay.” Few men have done more than Pollard to ensure that is so.\nKieron Pollard is an Investor and Ambassador for Me + U."

  "body": "New Zealand opener Finn Allen was comically run out during the San Francisco Unicorns’ 35-run loss to the Seattle Orcas in Major League Cricket on Sunday morning.\nThe 24-year-old got San Francisco’s run chase off to an explosive start at Texas’ Grand Prairie Stadium, slapping 28 runs from his first nine deliveries. He plundered five boundaries from Seattle captain Wayne Parnell’s opening over, including a glorious six over long-on.\nAfter combining with wicketkeeper Matthew Wade for a 42-run opening partnership, Allen fended a length delivery from West Australian seamer Cameron Gannon towards mid-wicket for what should have been a comfortable single.\nAllen leisurely jogged towards the non-striker’s end, only for Orcas fielder Shehan Jayasuriya to retrieve the ball and fling it at the stumps. The right-hander attempted to slide his bat, but instead dropped it short of the crease – replays confirmed he had been run out, gone for 28 (10). \nUnicorns captain Aaron Finch was not impressed with the dismissal, failing to hide his frustration from the dugout. \n“What’s going on here?” former Glamorgan all-rounder Alan Wilkins cried in commentary.\n“He can’t believe it … look at that, what’s he doing? Get to the other end!\n“Seriously, that is comedy.”\nFormer Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar continued: “That is sloppy cricket.”\nGet all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail.

San Francisco was ultimately bowled out for 142 in 17.5 overs, falling 35 runs short of the 178-run target.\nEarlier, South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen smacked 53 (31) in a player of the match performance, steering Seattle towards 4-177 from their 20 overs.\nGannon, representing the Orcas as a local player, claimed 4-23 from 3.5 overs during the run chase, including the crucial dismissals of New Zealand’s Corey Anderson and Pakistan’s Shadab Khan.\nThe Unicorns will next face the Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie on Wednesday morning at 10.30am AEST."

At the end of the day I am proud as everyone contributed. We knew it was a good batting wicket, we were prepared for this moment from a week ago. We had to be confident and believe in each other. We got over the line today, we were been put under pressure earlier this week. You are going to bat like Nicky P, I told myself, and backed my skill. I just had to execute my skills, I have been working on it since the last 5-6 years. It was really special for me. I just want to thank all the fans and supporters, they have been really amazing.”\nHaving won the toss and opting to bowl first, MI New York reduced Seattle to 183/9 in their 20 over quota. Trent Boult (3/34) and Rashid Khan (3/9) led the bowling attack from the front.\nFor Seattle, Quinton de Kock was the pick of the batters with his 87 off 52 deliveries.\n"

So it’s going to be a good quality game of cricket that gives us the best chance to show existing fans and new fans the game. \n“We’ve got as far as anyone ever has. So after all the false starts, I think it’s finally here.” \nPart of the groundwork that MLC did was been the creation of Minor League Cricket, a 26-team competition which began in 2021 to spark domestic player development. \nThe teams will feature a maximum of six foreign players and a minimum of five domestic players and Geale says developing a talent pool for the USA national team is a big part of the mission. \n“Building talent here domestically is one of our big pillars for sustainability,” he said. \nIt will be a challenge for coaches and captains to manage teams with experienced international players alongside emerging domestic players but South African Robin Peterson, head coach of the Mumbai Indians-backed MI New York team, says it will work. \n“In my experience, I found that the local boys tend to learn quite a bit playing alongside these superstars,” he told AFP. \n“I’ve seen it firsthand in the SA20 and even if you look at the growth and trajectory of the Indian cricket since the inception of the IPL, it has just been amazing the amount of talent that they’re producing. \n“I see the league here playing a similar role for USA cricket.” \nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia’s Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom. \nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India. \nPeterson is optimistic that T20, much more than longer forms of the game, has the ingredients to win eyeballs in the American market. \n“It’s becoming more entertainment,” he said. “It speaks to the American sporting psyche where the players are a lot more physical, fitter, stronger, hit the ball further. \n“It’s an exciting project. I think it’s about time people start taking cricket seriously in America.” \n\nComments\n\n\nMajor League Cricket\n\nBACK TO TOP\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

  "body": "The United States of America (USA), a first-world country is taking tiny little steps into the world of cricket, with its first major offering being the Major League Cricket (MLC). Cricket as a sport has remained USA's Achilles Heel and with some of the younger players set to rub shoulders with the best T20 players in the world, the tournament is not only hoping to expand the game beyond traditional territories but also give a platform to the young players, who will be seen with some of the best.  \n  \n\nThe 19-game tournament will be played at two venues - Dallas and Morrisville - with a hope to take the game beyond just a couple of centres and ensure that since there are two venues, the demand for tickets will be at an all-time high. The six teams are based in some of the most popular and traditional American cities - Los Angeles, Texas, New York, Washington DC, San Francisco and Seattle.\nThree of these teams have been purchased by the teams owning the IPL sides, Chennai Super Kings (Texas), Mumbai Indians (New York) and Kolkata Knight Riders (Los Angeles), while the co-owners of the Delhi Capitals have a stake in Seattle Orcas. The tournament promises to be a cracker since it's short and sweet while it could serve as the curtain-raiser for more games in the US, given there's a T20 World Cup to be hosted next year in June.\nThe Major League Cricket (MLC) while being an exciting proposition to expand the game beyond usual territories is a noble cause but since it's in America, the viewing will be affected in countries far east like the Indian subcontinent, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania. The day-night matches will begin at 6 AM while the day matches have a 2 AM IST start. \nThe inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC) will have a live broadcast through the Sports18 channel on TV while the streaming of all the games will be available on the Jiocinema app and website.\nLatest Cricket News\nTop News\nNipah virus presence detected in bats in Wayanad, no need to panic: Kerala govt\n'So cunning': Mannara Chopra bashes Ankita Lokhande in Bigg Boss 17 | WATCH\nENG vs SL Pitch Report: How will surface at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru play?\nRelated Cricket News\nENG vs SL Pitch Report: How will surface at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru play?\nAUS vs NED: Netherlands suffer biggest defeat in World Cup history \nBCCI appoints Amol Muzumdar as head coach of Indian women's cricket team \nGlenn Maxwell scores fastest century in ODI World Cup history, breaks Markram's record | WATCH\nAUS vs NED: Australian cricket team dons black armbands against Netherlands in Delhi\nLatest News\nHoroscope Today, October 26: Love to surround Capricorn, know about other zodiac signs\nPutin oversaw test firing of ballistic missiles, says Kremlin | DETAILS\nTata Motors developing new petrol engine to power premium SUVs Harrier, Safari\nHaqiqat Kya Hai: Modi government told the world its views on war\n© 2009-2023 Independent News Service.

  "body": "By Ria Gupta\nThe Major Cricket League has finally kicked off in the USA. The inaugural season of professional cricket, which has been sparking talks of a cricket revolution in the baseball-loving country, will see players from around the world come together under one roof to play 19 matches for the title. But the event is more than just cricket. From the likes of Satya Nadella claiming a stake in the games to AI recreating Indian flavours for the stands, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes. Here are six things you should know about the Major Cricket League (MLC):\nAll 19 of these T20 matches will be played over at the newly-constructed Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. The Grand Prairie Stadium was originally a baseball ground. But the venue has now been renovated with 7,200 seats and a grass wicket to serve as a cricket stadium. The MLC 2023 championship is the first-ever cricket event to be hosted at the venue. Formerly home to the minor league baseball Texas AirHogs, it’s now one of the largest complex of cricket fields in the United States.\nWith a sizable audience in its South Asian community, Texas is already witnessing a sold-out game. Cricket-loving diaspora, including Indian investors, make up for a majority of team-owners in the league. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella co-owns the Seattle Orcas, and is one of the major investors alongside Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan. Even before this, the state has had ample cricket activity, from Minor League Cricket events to Houston Women’s Opens. North Carolina is also a breeding ground for cricket enthusiasts, and regularly hosts Minor League Cricket at its cricket stadium in Morrisville.\nFor MLC 2023, food startup CloudChef is using Artificial Intelligence to record and recreate Indian recipes, and will serve chef Saransh Goila’s Goila Butter Chicken fries, kebabs from chef Sherry Mehta and other dishes prepared by chefs like Thomas Zacharias. How? Movements of the chefs at work are fed into an AI model (with inputs from cameras, thermal sensors and other devices), which comes back with a programme that chefs at a cloud kitchen anywhere in the world can follow to create the exact same dish and flavours without the chefs having to do it themselves.\nMLC 2023 is modelled on the Indian Premier League, and in fact, four of the six teams are owned by franchises of IPL–MI New York (Mumbai Indians), Texas Super Kings (Chennai Super Kings), LA Knight Riders (Kolkata Knight Riders) and the Seattle Orcas (Delhi Capitals). The other two teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom.Each team can have 16 to 19 member players, with at least one under-23 domestic player. The 110 players, in total, are a mix of international champions, including prominent names in Indian cricket such as Unmukt Chand and Sunil Narine. Also look out for former South Africa skipper Faf Du Plessis, Rashid Khan, Aaron Finch, Trent Boult and Jason Roy.\nThe first eight matches are being played in Texas, after which the season will move to North Carolina. The playoffs and the final will be played in Texas. For the full schedule as per Indian Standard Time, head here.\nThe Major League Cricket 2023 kicked off with a match between Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders today. The game streamed in India at 6am IST. The fixtures are on till 31 July, and Viacom18 and JioCinema will be live streaming the entire event in India. Fans can also watch MLC matches on other apps such as. Sports18 1, Sports18 1 HD and Sports18 Khel will telecast the MLC matches on TV.\nBy Ria Gupta\nBy Condé Nast Traveller\nBy Shikha Tripathi\nBy Arundhati Ail\nBy Samanth Subramanian\nBy Ria Gupta\nConnect with Condé Nast Traveller India\nAssociated Sites\n© 2023 Condé Nast.

  "body": "Crictoday\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCricket Today\t\t\t\t\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) has arrived in the United States, marking the beginning of a new era for cricket enthusiasts. With influential owners from the renowned Indian Premier League (IPL) investing in franchises, the inaugural season of MLC promises to be an electrifying spectacle. This exciting development has captured the attention of fans and players worldwide, as it presents a unique opportunity to witness the fusion of international talent and American cricketing infrastructure.\nThe league brings together a stellar cast of players, blending established stars with emerging talents from cricketing nations. The inaugural season is poised to showcase the highest level of cricketing skill and entertainment as teams battle it out to claim the coveted MLC title. Among the myriad of talented individuals set to grace the field, there are seven players who stand out as ones to watch closely.\nAs fans eagerly anticipate the debut season of MLC, these players are expected to set the stage ablaze with their captivating performances, creating a lasting impression on American cricketing history. In addition to their captivating performances, these seven players are expected to leave their mark in history with their outrageous stunts, goofy antics, and epic pranks!\nIn this article, we highlight seven players who are set to make a significant impact in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket.\n1) Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings)\nFaf du Plessis, the former South African captain, brings immense experience and leadership to the Texas Super Kings. Known for his impeccable technique and calm demeanor, du Plessis is a reliable top-order batsman capable of anchoring the innings. His ability to construct innings and score big runs will be invaluable to his team’s success. Not to forget his recent form with the bat for the Royal Challengers finishing 2nd on the list, and an impeccable career in T20.\n2) Rashid Khan (MI New York)\nThe Afghan spin sensation Rashid Khan has consistently performed in various T20 leagues worldwide. His deceptive leg spin and remarkable control over line and length make him a lethal weapon in any bowling attack. Rashid’s ability to take wickets regularly and restrict the opposition’s scoring rate will be pivotal in MI New York’s quest for glory. Having finished 2nd on the purple cap list and continuing to maintain his mystery, Rashid would be unplayable. \n3) Sunil Narine (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\nSunil Narine, the crafty West Indian all-rounder, is renowned for his unconventional but effective bowling style. His variations, particularly the mystery spin, have troubled many batters. Narine’s ability to stifle the flow of runs in the middle overs and contribute crucial runs with the bat makes him an integral part of the Los Angeles Knight Riders’ setup. Sunil will be rearing to undo his below-par IPL season. \n4) Andre Russell (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\nAndre Russell, the explosive Jamaican all-rounder, is a force to be reckoned with in the T20 format. His powerful hitting and ability to clear boundaries will make him a nightmare for any bowling attack. Russell’s dynamic presence in the middle order and his knack for delivering impactful performances with both bat and ball will be vital for the Los Angeles Knight Riders. Although he is on the back of a bad year in IPL 2023, Dre Russ has had a phenomenal T20 career, and the grounds in the USA would be too small for him.\n5) Devon Conway (Texas Super Kings)\nThe talented New Zealand batsman, Devon Conway, has been making waves in international cricket with his consistent run-scoring ability. His elegant stroke play, combined with a solid technique, allows him to adapt to different situations. Conway’s ability to build innings and accelerate when needed will be crucial for the success of the Texas Super Kings. Devon was instrumental in CSK’s 5th IPL title scoring vital runs and clinching the player of the match in the finals. \n6) Tim David (MI New York)\nTim David, the Singaporean-born Australian cricketer, has impressed with his explosive batting displays in various T20 leagues. His aggressive approach, coupled with an extensive range of shots, makes him a dangerous middle-order batsman. David’s ability to provide quick runs in the death overs and his athleticism in the field will be invaluable for MI New York. His exploits in the recently concluded season of IPL 2023 will be a massive boost for the team. \n7) Kagiso Rabada (MI New York)\nKagiso Rabada, the South African pace sensation, is known for his express pace and ability to generate bounce. With his ability to swing the ball both ways and deliver lethal yorkers, Rabada is a nightmare for batters in the death overs. His wicket-taking prowess and ability to contain runs under pressure will make him a key player for MI New York.\nAs Major League Cricket prepares to embark on its inaugural season, the league boasts an impressive array of talent from across the globe. The presence of experienced campaigners like Faf du Plessis, Rashid Khan, Sunil Narine, and Andre Russell, along with emerging stars like Devon Conway, Tim David, and Kagiso Rabada, is set to provide thrilling cricketing action for fans. These seven players, with their unique skills and match-winning abilities, are bound to significantly impact the inaugural season of Major League Cricket. But let’s not forget. They’ll also provide us with plenty of entertainment off the field. They’ll surely bring us some hilarious pranks, wacky outfits, and maybe even a few epic dance moves!\nRamiz Raja\nwarning to Pakistan\nRashid Khan\nWasim Akram\nMS Dhoni\nWankhede stadium\nR Ashwin\nSachin Tendulkar\nBCCI warns\nUrvashi Rautela\nSanju Samson\nDavid Warner\nIND VS ENG\nAl-Nassr\nVirat Kohli\nPAK vs AFG\nBabar Azam\nHardik Pandya\nDavid Warner\nShubman Gill\nSA Vs NED\nInd Vs Pak\nICCWorldCup\nRohit Sharma\nAbout Us\nMagazine\nFeedback\nCareer\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nRSS Feed\nPolicies \u0026 Standards\nContact Us\nMedia Kit\nGrehlakshmi\nDiamond books\nक्रिकटुडे हिंदी\nTingaland\nCricket Today\n  "

The captains of the six MLC teams gathered for photos and a media conference ahead of MLC’s inaugural season, which starts this week.\nA photoshoot with the team captains took place at the newly-completed Grand Prairie Stadium, followed by a media conference at Hillwood Corporate Offices in Dallas. MLC co-founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan and all six team captains came together to celebrate the future of cricket in the United States ahead of the sold-out inaugural match between the Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders this Thursday evening at Grand Prairie Stadium.\nThe highlight of the event was the grand unveiling of the new MLC Championship Trophy. Designed and produced in America by the renowned Bennett Awards, out of California, the trophy is a stunning embodiment of the modern era of cricket in the United States. Its contemporary design in bronze metal pays homage to the sport's rich heritage while emphasizing the forward-thinking vision of Major League Cricket. The Trophy's dynamic shape captures the spirit of innovation and progress, symbolizing the growth and potential of cricket within the American landscape.\nDuring the media conference all eyes were on the six team captains as they took the stage. Captains in attendance included international stars Kieron Pollard (MI New York), Sunil Narine (Los Angeles Knight Riders), Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings), Aaron Finch (San Francisco Unicorns), Wayne Parnell (Seattle Orcas) and Moises Henriques (Washington Freedom). The captains engaged in a Q\u0026A session with the media in attendance – their first collective media presence since arriving in the Lone Star State.\nAaron Finch, San Francisco Unicorns Captain, said, \"We are blown away about the amount of people that turned up for our fan day. Having the opportunity to speak to young cricketers was brilliant. The ability to grow the game in this part of the world and hopefully fast track the next generation of players to become world class players in these facilities is unbelievable. So I think that is our role for us and this competition.”\nLos Angeles Knight Riders captain Sunil Narine was assured of high quality action, while Seattle Orcas skipper Wayne Parnell is looking for a bright start to the league. “Based on how much cricket has been played here, it will be high quality with all these international players feeding information to the youngsters – it will grow from strength to strength,\" Narine said.\n“Being in America, it is a land for dreamers. For us as international cricketers in America, it is our duty to promote the game in America and make sure over the next five to 10 years it takes off. A lot of expats play the game, but to get the Americans who were born and bred here, it is vital,” said Parnell.\nFaf du Plessis, Texas Super Kings captain, is impressed with the preparationsf for the stadium. \"The stadium looks beautiful. Walking into the stadium it was amazing to see how much work has gone into getting it ready. The outfield looks green and lush. The pitches were really good and impressive. From that perspective, the tournament is already impressive.\n“I see myself, in 10 or 15 years, coming into American sports and you can see the American feel watching the game of cricket which is unique to anywhere else in the world,\" he said.\nKieron Pollard, MI New York captain, said, \"From an MI Perspective, we look at new talent and are able to scout those international players and when we look at it and go around the world in each tournament, the most important people are the domestic talent.”\nThe league also announced a line-up of illustrious announcers from across the globe, bringing a rich range of international cricket experience to give color to broadcasts showcasing the historic season.\nThe commentary team includes the legendary Sunil Gavaskar (India), one of the greatest batters of all-time, former South Africa captain Graeme Smith, former New Zealand international Danny Morrison and former Zimbabwe international Mpumelelo Mbangwa. Experienced announcers Natalie Germanos (South Africa) and Alan Wilkins (Wales) along with rising star Nikhil Uttamchandani (Barbados) complete the line-up.\n\n At HT Sports Desk, passionate reporters work round the clock to provide detailed updates from the world of sports.

  "body": "MLC 2023 Final: Nicholas Pooran put up a superlative effort with the bat to help MI New York clinch the first-ever Major League Cricket title on Sunday.\n\nThe wicketkeeper-batter scored 137 runs off 55 balls as MI New York took down Seattle Orcas by seven wickets at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas. MI New York restricted Seattle Orcas to 183/9 before chasing down their target in just 16 overs.\n\nMI New York didn't get off to the best of starts as Imad Wasim dismissed Steven Taylor in their third delivery of the opening over. However, Pooran made his intentions quite clear for the night when he struck consecutive sixes off Wasim's bowling in the same over. The West Indian showcased tremendous form as he hit Dwaine Pretorius for three sixes and two boundaries in the third over.\n\nOpening batter Shayan Jahangir fell to Wayne Parnell in the fifth over, but Pooran continued to find maximums at the other end. He struck three sixes off Andrew Tye's bowling to take MI New York's score to 80/2 in just 6 overs. Pooran kept finding the middle of his bat and smashed a total of 10 fours and 13 sixes during his innings. The Captain remained unbeaten on 137 runs off 55 balls and single-handedly took MI New York over the line with 4 overs to spare.\n\nEarlier in the day, MI New York won the toss and put Seattle Orcas into bat. Quinton de Kock looked in prime touch as he struck Jessy Singh for consecutive boundaries in the second over. However, Rashid Khan sent De Kock's opening partner Nauman\nAnwar packing for 9 runs off 13 balls in the fifth over. Thereafter, Shehan Jayasuriya provided excellent support to De Kock as he hit David Wiese for a four and six in the seventh over. But Steven Taylor bowled him out for 16 runs off 15 balls in the tenth over.\nFollowing Heinrich Klaasen's early departure, De Kock and Shubham Ranjane put up a fantastic partnership of 51 runs from 24 balls to take Orcas' score to 142/4 in 16.1 overs. Thereafter, the Orcas kept losing wickets at regular intervals, but Dwaine Pretorius' cameo of 21 runs from 7 balls helped his team post a formidable total on the board.\nSpeaking about his team's victory, the leading run-scorer in the tournament and MLC Season 1 MVP Nicholas Pooran said, \"We spoke today about having an opportunity to do something special. I am very proud of everything every individual did and everyone contributed in some way. The people in the dressing room told me that I just needed to bat like Nicky P and not think about batting like the captain. I just backed my skills. The platform was there today and the opportunity was there.\"\nMeanwhile, the Seattle Orcas' Captain Wayne Parnell said, \"Whenever someone plays like that, you have to give them credit. Credit to Nicky and his team. It did not look like he (Pooran) would mishit a ball today. We put up a decent total but we have to give them credit today. The first MLC season has gone really well. Credit to everyone who has organized it. Credit to our owners and the management for picking this team and giving us the freedom to play this brand of cricket.\"\nBrief Scores:\nMI New York 184/3 (Nicholas Pooran 137*, Dewald Brevis 20, Imad Wasim 1/14) beat Seattle Orcas 183/9 (Quinton de Kock 87, Shubham Ranjane 29, Rashid Khan 3/9) by 7 wickets.\nCatch the latest stock market updates here.

Taylor's struggle eventually ended and while the likes of Tim David, Nicholas Pooran and Rashid Khan tried to hit big, TSK put up a bowling masterclass, particularly in the death overs, to defend the target. Earlier, Devon Conway threw his hands a lot in the last two overs of the powerplay and the gambled somewhat paid off. It got TSK to a score of 46/1 at the end of the powerplay. Kagiso Rabada got his fellow South African Faf du Plessis in the powerplay and that remained the only wicket to fall in that period of the match.

MINY desperately need the big Aussie to explode. \nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Match 7 Live: MINY 106/5 in 16\nThey need 49 to win of 24. Tim David was stuck at the non-striker's end for the entire over but Hammad Azam managed to hit two fours in it.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: OUT! Pollard falls for a duck!\nThat's two in two for Mohsin. Another googly from him and Pollard seems to know little about it. Ball goes past the inside edge and hits him on the pad, umpire gives it out but Pollard reviews. Bat and pad are quire close and for a second, it looks like Pollard might have got something on it. But the third umpire rules that he has inconclusive evidence and asks the umpire to stay with his decision.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 7 Live Major League Cricket: OUT!\nShayan Jehangir is stumped. Mohsin with a googly on off, Jehangir comes down the track well in advance and totally misses the ball. Straightforward stumping for Conway.\nMajor League Cricket 2023 Live: Nicholas Pooran is run out!\nWhat a big wicket this is and what a terrible way for MINY to lose it. Pooran calls for a second run that was just not on. The fielder at deep extra cover comes in and puts in a bullet throw to Conway, who whips off the bails. Replays show that Pooran was well short. Pooran himself was slow to turn and has ran himself out. \nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Match 7 Live: BACK TO BACK FOURS!\nThis has turned into a good over for MINY. Shayan hit the fourth ball past backward point and then reverse sweeps the next past third man.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: SIX! First of the MINY innings and Pooran gets it\nWell Steven Taylor's sluggish 15 off 21 came to an end in the ninth over and that might be a boon for MINY because it has brought the dangerous Nicholas Pooran out there. Mohammad Mohsin bowls the second ball of the 10th in his arc and Pooran smashes it over the bowler's head.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 7 Live Major League Cricket: End of powerplay, MINY 32/1\nA sedate start to the chase, as had been the case for MINY, though they were about 10 runs ahead at this point. \nMajor League Cricket 2023: FOUR! Ends the over with another\nNew York are 31/1 in 5 overs. This time it is Shayan Jahangir who does it. Flighted on middle and off, Jahangir smashes it over mid on. \nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Match 7 Live: FOUR!\nSantner comes in to bowl the fifth and is welcomed by Taylor with a boundary. Short on middle and off, Taylor makes room and sends it over square leg.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: 2 overs gone, MINY 4/1\nUSA legend Steven Taylor is now out in the middle with Shayan Jehangir. Just one run came from that second over by Theron. \nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 7 Live Major League Cricket: GONE! Fantastic delivery from Theron\nMINY's opening stand lasts just eight balls. A fantastic delivery from Theron, full and jagging away late. Monank Patel plays it and edges it to Conway.\nMonank Patel c Conway b Theron 0 (2), MINY 4/1 in 1.2 overs\nMajor League Cricket 2023 Live: The players are back!\nShayan Jahangir and Monank Patel open the innings for MINY, Daniel Sams opening the bowling for TSK. MINY need 155 to win. \nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Match 7 Live: TSK 154/7 in 20 overs\nSantner's little dash in the end has helped TSK put up  a score of over 150. It hasn't been the most fluid of T20 innings you would ever see. But then if it was difficult for the team batting first, there is a very good chance that it won't be easy for the team batting second. \nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: Into the last over\nTSK are 149/5. Santner has gone hunting in the last two overs and raced to 24 of 11. Daniel Sams will be on strike, facing up against Trent Boult. \nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 7 Live Major League Cricket: TSK 122/4 in 17 overs\nDJ Bravo is out there, hero of the last match for TSK even though they lost it. Santner is at the other end. It is kitchen sink time now for TSK. \nMajor League Cricket 2023: GONE! Miller falls to Rabada!\nRabada goes full and wide outside off, Miller throws his hands at it. The fielder at deep backward point runs forward to take the catch. Fantastically set up there and MINY have got the big wicket of Miller just as the death overs are about to start.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: SIX! Conway with the first maximum of the match\nThat also brings up the 50 partnership between him and David Miller off just 39 balls. Fifth ball of the 15th, Conway goes after one flighted by Rashid on middle and leg. That goes sailing over deep midwicket. Conway on 66 off 50, Miller on 16 off 13, TSK are 110/2 in 15 overs. \nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 7 Live Major League Cricket: 50 for Conway!\nIt has come in 42 balls but TSK would want him to stay till the end. They are now 92/2 in 13.2 overs\nMajor League Cricket 2023: TSK 91/2 in 13 overs\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Match 7 Live: FOUR!\nRashid with a delivery on middle and leg, Conway meets it with a reverse sweep. Beats short third man to his right.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: GONE! Pollard gets one\nOff pace delivery from Pollard, Chetty tries to go over long off after coming down the track. No power at all and he holes out to Rashid Khan at long on.\nCody Chetty c Rashid Khan b Pollard 12 (18), TSK 58/2 in 8.3 overs\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 7 Live Major League Cricket: TSK 46/1 at the end of the powerplay\nConway on 28 off 18, Chetty on seven off nine. Conway has tried his luck and the gambles have paid off. Now for them to keep up the run rate as much as possible despite the field restrictions being off. \nMajor League Cricket 2023: FOUR! Conway riding his luck\nConway just looking to put bat on ball here and why not, this is the last over of the powerplay. Throws his hands at a length delivery outside off, doesn't keep it down but finds the gap between backward point and point.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Match 7 Live: Inside edge and four! TSK are 27/1 in 4 overs\nCody Chetty comes in to replace Du Plessis and he gets a thick inside edge off the last ball of the fourth. It evades leg stump and beats the keeper too.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: BOWLED HIM! Rabada strikes!\nWhat a wicket that is for Rabada and he doesn't celebrate it almost as if he knows he got lucky with that one. Attempted yorker becomes a full toss, Du Plessis looks to ramp and misses it entirely. \ndu Plessis b Rabada 8 (9), TSK 20/1 in 2.5 overs\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 7 Live Major League Cricket: FOUR!\nHalf volley outside off from Boult, du Plessis goes over extra cover and it dribbles to the boundary after taking a bounce.\nMajor League Cricket 2023: TSK 10/0 after the 1st over\nA four off the fourth ball and a four off the sixth. and Conway is away. Bowling the second over is Trent Boult and he will be up against Faf du Plessis. Two proper giants of international cricket across formats. \nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Match 7 Live: Here we go then!\nDevon Conway and Faf du Plessis are out there for TSK, with the former facing up. Ehsan Adil has the new ball for MINY.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: The pitch\nNatalie Germanos and Sunil Gavaskar were on pitch report duties today: It's pretty warm - 40 degrees Celsius. Same strip that was used yesterday. Even square boundaries, longer hit straight. More wickets have fallen to pace in this tournament but spinners have been consistent. This looks like a very good pitch to bat on, little bit of grass and new ball bowlers will get some help early on.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Match 7 Live Major League Cricket:  TOSS ALERT!\nFaf du Plessis has won the toss and TSK will bat first. \nMajor League Cricket 2023 Live: Dwayne Bravo's classic\nTSK had to chase down a target of 164 in their last match. That started looking like an impossible task when they were reduced to 78/6 in 14 overs. However, then came an act of rolling back the years from veteran Dwayne Bravo. Bravo smashed 76 off 39 balls in an innings that included five fours and six sixes and almost single-handedly brought Texas to within six runs of the target. He was not dismissed but it was too steep a gradient to climb in the end for TSK.\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Match 7 Live: MINY full squad\nDewald Brevis, Shayan Jahangir, Monank Patel, Hammad Azam, Nicholas Pooran(w), Kieron Pollard(c), Tim David, Kagiso Rabada, Nosthush Kenjige, Trent Boult, Ehsan Adil, Steven Taylor, Sarabjit Ladda, David Wiese, Jason Behrendorff, Waqar Salamkheil, Jasdeep Singh, Tristan Stubbs\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: TSK full squad\nFaf du Plessis(c), Devon Conway(w), Lahiru Milantha, David Miller, Milind Kumar, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, Calvin Savage , Gerald Coetzee, Mohammad Mohsin, Rusty Theron, Cody Chetty, Imran Tahir, Sami Aslam, Daniel Sams, Cameron Stevenson, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Zia Shahzad\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York 2023 Live MLC: Hello and welcome!\nCricket has joined the Major League planet in the USA that is already occupied by its baseball and football, or soccer, iterations. The former, of course, is on a different planet altogether, a pioneering league that is considered one of the inspirations of the IPL itself. The MLS has done wonders for the sport of football in the country. Now comes the MLC, hoping to do the rather unimaginable task of making cricket as much an American sport as baseball or basketball. If that is to be, then encounters like CSK vs MI in the IPL is sorely needed. Let's see if the MLC versions of these two teams can emulate their success both on and off the field. For now, though, this is a game that could break a four-team deadlock this year. Let's get to it\n\n"

  "body": "MI New York won the first edition of the Major League Cricket. Here is the Overseas Team of the 2023 edition.\nA number of overseas stars stood out in the USA-based league, and we have picked the best overseas XI of MLC 2023.\nWade’s powerplay strike rate of 188 was the highest among all openers in the season. Though he made only one fifty, he gave his team fiery starts throughout, the highlight being a 41-ball 78 against Los Angeles Knight Riders that propelled San Francisco to 212.\nApart from Wade, de Kock was the only opener to make 100 runs at a strike rate of 130 at the 2023 MLC, forcing us to go in with two left-handers at the top. While not at his best in the first six overs – he struck at 117 – he made up for it in the middle overs, scoring at 159. De Kock ended as the second-highest run-scorer in the league, topping his season with 87 in the final.\nPooran’s unbeaten 137 in 55 balls in the final helped New York clinch the title, but he was as lethal in the group stage as well. He started with a 28-ball 40 in the opener and also struck two successive sixties and ended as the only player with more than 300 runs in the MLC.\nKlaasen had the best strike rate among all players in the league with 30 runs, and made one of two hundreds in the edition. He reached 25 four times, and had a strike rate of more than 190 thrice. His knock of 110 not out against New York was off 44 balls.\nLAKR finished last, but Russell was the lone performer as he often is with Knight Riders franchises around the world: no one else from the side made more than 135 runs. In the first game, LAKR were all out for 112, Russell top-scoring with a 34-ball 55. He then powered the side in their chase of 213 against San Francisco, and starred in their only win of the season, with an unbeaten 37-ball 70 against Washington Freedom.\nThere was stiff competition for this spot, but Anderson edged ahead of Tim David for performing better under pressure. He started with an unbeaten 91 after his team had collapsed to 50-4, hitting seven sixes during his match-winning knock. His 20-ball 39 also proved to be a game-changer as the Knight Riders fell 21 runs short of the target of 213.\nShadab was the only player to pick up five wickets and make 125 runs in the first MLC. He played a number of handy knocks throughout the season, including a 30-ball 61 in his team’s game against MI New York. He top-scored for San Francisco against Seattle with a 23-ball 37 and rose through the batting order to No.4 as the tournament progressed.\nImad was the top wicket-taker among spinners in the tournament, and got a scalp every 14.50 deliveries. He picked up at least one wicket in every match that he played, including ending with two-fors thrice.\nAdam Zampa had nine wickets at a better average, but we picked Rashid due to his heroics in the final against Seattle. In a high-scoring game, Rashid stood out for his spell of 3-9 in four overs, ending as the most economical bowler by a huge margin across both teams, establishing his class in high-octane clashes once again.\nBoult picked twice the number of wickets as second-placed Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye, and was miles ahead of the rest in the league. He finished with less than two wickets only once in eight games, and scalped three successive four-wicket hauls, and claimed 3-34 in the final, including the wicket of de Kock.\nThough Tye was expensive on occasions, he got the wickets, and ended with a strike rate of 13.63. He was the standout pacer in the team alongside Gannon and picked at least a wicket in his six games.\nIf you enjoyed this story, please share with your fellow cricket fans and team-mates\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n12 Issues for just £39.99\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox.\n\"It's such a lame excuse\"\nFollow on:\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox."

  "body": "Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell believes the Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA is \"more attractive\" than England's T20 Blast to some international stars because of the former's simpler and shorter schedule and bigger crowds. He complained about the excessive travel and less time between matches in the Blast.\nMaxwell played for Birmingham Bears in this year's Blast, which was a nine-team tournament and involved at least 14 matches for each side. The Aussie, however, pulled out of The Hundred to manage his workload. \nMeanwhile, the MLC is a six-team tournament, where each side plays the others once in the group stage followed by the playoffs.\nMaxwell didn't have the best of T20 Blast seasons with the Bears, scoring 248 runs from 14 matches at an average of 17.71, striking at 153.08.\nGlenn Maxwell is playing in the County Championship in England for Warwickshire. \nIn his first match of the season, he scored a 67-ball 81, hitting 10 fours and two sixes. The knock, which came soon after Australia's loss in the third Ashes Test, sparked interest in him having an outside chance to be in the Aussie team.\nThe fourth Ashes Test of the five-match series will be played between July 19-23 in Manchester.\nCheck out India Squad for World Cup 2023 \u0026 South Africa Squad for World Cup 2023.

  "body": "By Matt Hughes For Mailonline \n Published:  05:24 EDT, 25 May 2023   |  Updated:  14:47 EDT, 25 May 2023   \n\n 59\nView  comments\n\nJason Roy is set to cancel his ECB central contract in order to sign a lucrative deal to play Major League Cricket in the United States this summer. \nThe World Cup-winning opening batter has been offered a two-year deal worth around £300,000 by the Los Angeles Knight Riders, which he wants to pursue despite the risk it could jeopardise his place in England's squad for this year's 50-over title defence in India.\nRoy is currently contracted by the ECB on a so-called incremental deal until October, which gives the governing body some control over his schedule. \nIn a historic move Roy would become the first England player to walk away from a central contract in order to pursue alternative ambitions with a Twenty20 franchise.\nRoy was a mainstay of England's white ball revolution under Eoin Morgan which climaxed with winning the 50-over World Cup for the first time at Lord's four years ago, but lost his place in the side last summer and was left out of the squad for the Twenty20 World Cup last autumn, which England went on to win. \nJason Roy plans to walk away from his England central contract to sign a lucrative two-year deal with new Major League Cricket franchise Los Angeles Knight Riders\nRoy has been a regular presence at the top of the order for England in 50-over cricket\nThe 32-year-old was recalled to the 50-over team after the short-form World Cup however and played nine one-day internationals against Australia, South Africa and Bangladesh last winter, so remains in contention to be named in Matthew Mott's 50-over World Cup squad this autumn.\nRoy has held talks with the ECB over the last few weeks with an announcement on his future expected shortly. \nAs Major League Cricket clashes with the County Championship and T20 Blast it is understood that the ECB are only prepared to grant Roy the No Objection Certificate required to play if they cancel his incremental deal.\nWhile Roy retains ambitions to play for England the security of the two-year offer he has received from LA Knight Riders is a significant factor in his reasoning. \nMail Sport first revealed the American interest in Roy, who would become the first England player to sign up for the new league that has already recruited other overseas stars such as Aaron Finch, Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje.\nThe ECB have told Roy that his decision will not impact on Mott's selection plans or the next round of central contracts, which are awarded in October. \nWith the Ashes starting next month England do not have any white-ball matches until series against New Zealand and Ireland in August and September, by which point Roy will be back in the country as he is also contracted to play for Oval Invincibles in the Hundred.\nRoy's willingness to walk away from an ECB deal illustrates the threat to international cricket posed by the rise of T20 franchise leagues, fuelled by the huge growth of the IPL. \nRoy played a key role when England won the 50-over World Cup back in 2019 \nHe has been playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders during the latest Indian Premier League\nMail Sport revealed earlier this month that Mumbai Indians are preparing to offer Jofra Archer a 12-month contract that would take precedence over his ECB deal and Roy's move reflects this trend, as the LA Knight Riders are owned his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders.\nThe inaugural Major League Cricket which launches in Texas this summer represents a particular threat to English cricket due to scheduling, with Mail Sport revealing on Wednesday that the new competition will expand into August next year, leading to a clash with the Hundred. \nFour of the six franchises in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Washington are owned by IPL teams who are offering salaries of up to £300,000, compared to a top rate of £125,000 in the Hundred.\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday \u0026 Metro Media Group"

They faced off against the Seattle Orcas (SEO) in a high-scoring battle.  \nThe inaugural MLC final, held on July 30, 2023, at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, was a spectacle of cricketing prowess and strategic gameplay. The match saw MI New York triumph over the Seattle Orcas, securing the championship title in a thrilling encounter.\nSeattle Orcas set a target of 183 in the first innings thanks to a gritty 87 off 52 from opener Quinton de Kock and some notable contributions from the middle order. In reply, MI New York's victory was largely attributed to the exceptional performance of their stand-in captain, Nicholas Pooran. Displaying an extraordinary display of batting, Pooran scored a staggering 137 runs off just 55 balls.  \n𝓞𝓷 𝓻𝓮𝓹𝓮𝓪𝓽 🔄 Can’t stop watching @nicholaspooran’s 1️⃣3️⃣ sixes he hit today‼️ #MLC2023 #MLCFINAL pic.twitter.com/OynKTi2xnD\n    \nPooran's  innings, which included 10 fours and 13 sixes, were instrumental in MI New York successfully chasing down the 184-run target set by the Seattle Orcas with four overs to spare. Pooran's innings began aggressively, with him scoring a half-century off just 16 balls. He continued his onslaught, launching towering maximums and becoming the second batter to score a hundred in the tournament. His unbeaten 137 is recorded as the second-highest score by a captain batting second in T20s.\nWest Indian Nicholas Pooran was the star of the tournament bagging 5 awards in total.

  "body": "Although it won't have official status, the most recent T20 league to be established, the USA-based Major League Cricket, has drawn a number of international names.\nTrending Photos\nMajor League League 2023 is the latest T20 league which has been launched by USA. The competition has attracted lots of cricket fans following the involvement of numerous international stats. However, the competition will operate without any official status and records achieved during the tournament will not reflect on the players career stats playing in the league.\n\n\nThe Major League Cricket has been sanctioned by USA cricket after their dispute with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the league organisers. When the country's official administrative body allowed the league to take place, the International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctioned the league as well. The approval by ICC allowed members to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to their cricketers participating in the tournament.\nIf the league was not sanctioned by ICC, the tournament would have been termed as Disapproved Cricket, with members requested not to provide NOCs to their players.\n\n\nOur domestic boys were shining bright tonight \n\nWho enjoyed the first-ever match of #MajorLeagueCricket pic.twitter.com/lTmsrBlztT\n— Major League Cricket (@MLCricket) July 14, 2023\nWhichever tournament is not approved following ICC's guidelines, is an unsanctioned league. Players who take part in these kind of tournaments face major consequences. The Indian Cricket League (2007 and 2009), was deemed as a \"rebel league\" with all players facing bans in other events.\n\n\nThe MLC lacks official legitimacy because it is taking place in the USA, an Associate nation. The MLC is still a valid competition despite its lack of official recognition. Simply said, it indicates that the players' tournament records won't be included in their career statistics.\nBoth the 2018 and 2019 Global T20 Canada events and this year's ILT20, which was hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a non-Full-Member nation, also lacked official status.\n\n\nComing back to MLC 2023, a total of six teams are playing in the tournament. The tournament kickstarts on July 14. The good news for Indian fans is that the league will be available to watch in India. There are going to be 19 matches played in this tournament for 18 days. Four of the six teams in this tournament are backed by IPL franchises.\nLive Tv\nThank you\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device and the processing of information obtained via those cookies (including about your preferences, device and online activity) by us and our commercial partners to enhance site navigation, personalise ads, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

But he’s 100 per cent committed to playing for England, so I wouldn’t read into it the fact he signed one year that he’s not.\n“By no means is it Ben Stokes saying: ‘I don’t want to play for England’. All he talks about is being completely committed to playing for England and also captaining that Test team – planning for India, planning for the Ashes, planning for West Indies and Sri Lanka next summer. I don’t think it has crossed his mind not playing for England for the next four, five, six years.”\nA total of six three-year deals were offered – with Joe Root, Harry Brook and Mark Wood signing up, while white-ball captain Jos Buttler and injured seamer Jofra Archer have gone for a middle ground by taking two-year options.\nThere are 26 deals in all, spanning the age range from 19-year-old Rehan Ahmed to 41-year-old James Anderson. Fifteen are on two-year options, with eight on traditional 12-month terms and top-up payments handed to seam trio Matthew Fisher, Saqib Mahmood and the uncapped John Turner.\nNobody has refused to sign, but several may have been disappointed not to make the cut. David Willey is the only member of the World Cup squad in India not to make the list, highly-rated all-rounder Will Jacks was also omitted despite being capped in all three formats over the last year and Jason Roy is out after terminating the remainder of his previous deal to play Major League Cricket in the United States last summer.\nKey was speaking in Bengaluru, where England will be hoping to boost a dreadful World Cup campaign with victory over Sri Lanka on Thursday, and admitted having a tough conversation with Willey.\n“It’s fair to say David wasn’t best pleased, as you can understand, being the only one out here not to get a contract,” he said.\n“It’s bloody tough, to be honest. We’d love to live in a world where you can just say we have a pot of extra cash and you can just give him something because he’s come out for the World Cup.”\nKey believes the new raft of contracts have effectively safeguarded England’s interests at a time when the sports tectonic plates are shifting fast.\nThe spending power of the biggest Indian-backed T20 brands means international boards are struggling to compete and there has been a real fear at the ECB that its most prized assets could be lured away from the national set-up entirely.\n?️ We've announced our England Men's Central Contract offers for 2023-24…\nAnd seven players have received offers for the first time!\nFind out more ?\n— England Cricket (@englandcricket) October 24, 2023\n“You don’t know what the future holds with franchise cricket; you don’t know when the first year-long deal for an English cricketer is going to be offered from a franchise,” he said.\n“So I’m pretty pleased because I think for the first time in this changing landscape for cricket we start to see what players really think and what they really do. And we’ve seen that everyone’s committed to English cricket.\n“I don’t want a world where you see your best players going off and (only) playing franchise cricket. I want to see them playing for England.”\nH Brook, J Root, M Wood.\nR Ahmed, J Archer, G Atkinson, J Bairstow, J Buttler, B Carse, Z Crawley, S Curran, B Duckett, L Livingstone, O Pope, M Potts, A Rashid, J Tongue, C Woakes.\nM Ali, J Anderson, B Foakes, J Leach, D Malan, O Robinson, B Stokes, R Topley.\nM Fisher, S Mahmood, J Turner."

  "body": "Watch: A fielding violation prevented Texas Super Kings from dismissing Los Angeles Knight Riders’ Jaskaran Malhotra in the fifth over of the opening clash of the 2023 Major League Cricket.\nMalhotra survived after TSK were found to have one fielder fewer than the required number in the 30-yard circle during the fourth ball of the fifth over of LAKR’s innings. During the first six overs of each innings in a T20 game, only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle. TSK violated this clause and had three fielders outside the circle on the ball Malhotra was dismissed. He got a second chance, and the delivery was declared a no-ball instead.\nTSK were in the driver’s seat after posting 181-6 in the first innings and then had their rivals on the mat, at 34-4 in four overs. Malhotra attempted to break the momentum with a four and a six off consecutive balls in the fifth over before Calvin Savage dismissed the batter on the fourth ball.\nMalhotra played the length delivery with a flat bat to mid-on, where the fielder Rusty Theron latched on to an easy catch. Malhotra, however, immediately signalled that it was a no-ball, seemingly aware before the delivery itself that there was one fielder short of the inner circle.\nThe on-field umpires converged and signalled it a no-ball, as Malhotra survived, much to the frustration of TSK skipper Faf du Plessis.\nThe reprieve did not cost the Super Kings, as Malhotra added one more run to his tally, eventually falling for an 11-ball 22. Knight Riders were dismissed for 112 as Texas registered a mammoth 69-run win in the opener.\nSavage (Forgotte Rotten) bowls to Malhotra (Hookline Sinkers) who is caught out by Theron (Love Yas) but one of the fielders was out of position so it doesn't count.@JMWarehouse_ pic.twitter.com/KnuSyyvZVM\n— Jomboy (@Jomboy_) July 14, 2023\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please share with your fellow cricket fans and team-mates\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n12 Issues for just £39.99\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox.\n\"It's such a lame excuse\"\nFollow on:\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox."

  "body": "Major League Cricket got underway in Texas on Thursday, and the most serious attempt yet to establish a domestic competition in the United States provided all the ingredients of a modern Twenty20 league.\nFans at the purpose built cricket stadium, just a 15-minute drive from Dallas Fort Worth airport, were decked out in the yellow shirts of the victorious home side, the Texas Super Kings, and were treated to the familiar sight of big sixes and non-stop action.\nThe Super Kings won by 69 runs after making 181 for six and then bowling out the Los Angeles Knight Riders for 112.\nGet all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail. Sign up now!!!\n\nAny concerns that cricket in America might not be the real deal vanished when the action got under way and the crowd began cheering the big hitting of the home team.\nThe stadium previously belonged to the now defunct Texas Airhogs minor league baseball club, but since taking over the venue, MLC has spent over USD$20 million making it cricket-specific.\nFor viewers watching the TV broadcast, it would have been hard to tell the difference between MLC and the other T20 tournaments that have sprung up around the world.\n\nWith international players competing alongside domestic talent from the USA national team, the standard of play was clearly professional and the field and wicket looked up to scratch.\nThat was in marked contrast to many previous, short-lived attempts to “break the American market” with one-off events in unsuitable venues, and was also light years away from much of the domestic cricket, which for years was played on matting tracks.\nTexas’ South African bowler Rusty Theron was taken aback by the success of the opening game.\n“I am actually a little bit emotional, to be honest. This is such a grand event. There was an unbelievable atmosphere and I want to thank each and every individual who has come out here,” he said.\n\n\nSuper Kings batsman David Miller, who was awarded Player of the Match, for his hard-hitting 61 from 42 balls, including four sixes, was also impressed.\n“It’s fantastic to see such a great turn out and the facilities have been fantastic. I think there have been a few guys, kind of questioned around what it was going to be like but it shot the lights out here,” said the South African, one of a number of players with a background in the world’s top Twenty20 competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nMLC has backing from four IPL franchises including the Mumbai Indians, whose New York team began play on Friday.\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia’s Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India."

So after all the false starts, I think it’s finally here.”\nFormer Australian skipper Aaron Finch and Sydney Sixers veteran Moises Henriques will lead the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom respectively, while the two franchises will be coached by former Test all-rounder Shane Watson and NSW Blues mentor Greg Shipperd.\nMany other Australian internationals will feature, including Adam Zampa, Tim David, Jason Behrendorff, Andrew Tye, Matthew Wade, Marcus Stoinis, Daniel Sams, Ben Dwarshuis and Josh Philippe. The Seattle Orcas had initially secured the services of Mitchell Marsh, but the Australian all-rounder was forced to withdraw due to Ashes commitments.\nThere are also several international superstars taking part, including West Indies champion Andre Russell, New Zealand quick Trent Boult and South African prodigy Dewald Brevis.\nGet all the latest cricket news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail.

  "body": "A mix of Pakistan cricket’s cream and some familiar expats will be in action in the United States when the inaugural season of the Major League Cricket (MLC) — a long-awaited T20 tournament — kicks off on Friday (July 14).\nFast bowler Haris Rauf and all-rounders Shadab Khan and Imad Wasim are some of the big names from Pakistan who will participate in the first-of-its kind event being jointly hosted in Texas and North Carolina.\nHaris and Shadab, the two centrally contracted players, will represent San Francisco Unicorns, while Imad will be playing for Seattle Orcas.\nLos Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, Texas Super Kings, and Washington Freedom are the four other teams participating in the league. The 19-day competition will go on from July 13 to July 30 at Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park.\n    \n\nThe announcements came in earlier this month as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) granted no-objection certificates (NOCs) to the players after getting approval from the team management, medical panel, and the selection committee.\nThere were reports suggesting that the PCB demanded $25,000 per player to grant the NOCs.\nSeveral international players, who left Pakistan for greener pastures of the US, will also be seen in action, including Hammad Azam, Sami Aslam, Ehsan Adil, Saif Badar, Saad Ali, and Mukhtar Ahmed. They will be participating in MLC as local players.\nAzam and Adil will be representing the New York franchise owned by the Mumbai Indians of the Indian Premier League. While they left the country almost two-and-a-half years ago, the duo officially announced their retirement from Pakistan cricket only last week, as per a press release from PCB on Sunday.\n    \n\n“If you’re a former professional in another country, like Pakistan or West Indies, you have to show an NOC and an intent of retirement and then you’re considered a local for domestic leagues here,” Zubin Sarkari, tournament director of Minor League Cricket, said.\nSarkari, who is also currently handling operations at MLC, said that any player who can provide proof of intention to live in the US by having spent ten out of 12 months of the year in the country, and carries an approved visa is considered a local player by the domestic leagues’ management.\nLack of opportunities, excessive competition at home and, in a few cases, disregard from the PCB had led some of these cricketers to move to the USA.\nAslam, who has represented Pakistan in 13 Test matches and four One-Day Internationals, was dropped from the national squad in 2017. After struggling to find his way back in the team despite performing well domestically, the left-hander decided to move to the US in 2020 to seek a fresh start to his professional career.\n“Every player who is not playing in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is willing to come here,” Aslam told Dawn.com.\n“I know people who are currently leading teams in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy [and they are] saying that if they get an offer to play in the US, they will come here without thinking twice.”\nThe 27-year-old rued that countries such as Australia, England and India reward players who play red-ball cricket, but Pakistan ignores its longer format players. “That’s the reason why Test cricket is going down in the country.” he said.\n“Nobody wants to play the longer format and those who do, do it as an obligation. Players know that selectors don’t choose players who perform in the four-month long domestic season but the ones who perform in one season of the PSL.”\nCo-founded by Indian businessmen Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan among others, MLC has six teams, of which four are owned by various franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nAslam, who was picked by the Texas Super Kings in the domestic players draft held earlier in March, said he “wasn’t expecting to be picked by an IPL franchise because there were rumors of Indian teams not selecting Pakistani players but that didn’t happen”.\nHe added that they (the Super Kings) might have considered him as a US local resident instead.\n“I’m having a lot of fun. It’s a very professional setup. They (Chennai Super Kings) recently won the IPL and it is the same management for the Texas team so it is nice being a part of it.”\nBrashna Kasi is a Fulbright scholar and journalism graduate from Syracuse University New York.\nDear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.\n Compunode.com Pvt.

  "body": "West Indian all-rounder and MI New York captain Kieron Pollard smashed a 110 metre long six, the biggest of the Major League Cricket (MLC), on Tuesday, July 25.\nThe massive hit came on the second ball of the 12th over against the Seattle Orcas. Right-arm pacer Cameron Gannon from over-the-wicket dropped a slower-one short outside the off-stump. It didn't bounce much, allowing Pollard to clear his front leg and clear the ground over mid-wicket.\nHere's a video of the six:\n10 balls later, the all-rounder mistimed a short delivery from spinner Harmeet Singh for an easy catch to Gannon at deep mid-wicket. He went back after a brisk 18-ball 34, which included three sixes and a boundary.\nThe innings added to Nicholas Pooran's 68 (34) and took MI's score to 194/8. It was a par score but the Orcas chased it down in 19.2 overs courtesy of a stunning 44-ball 110 from Heinrich Klaasen, including a 26-run over vs Rashid Khan.\nUnfortunately for MI, Kieron Pollard suffered an injury in the second innings. While trying to save a straight shot from Klaasen against David Wiese's bowling at long-off, he fell right on his shoulder and called for the physio immediately. He walked back to the dugout in pain with his arm tucked into the t-shirt.\nIt could be a decisive blow for the side ahead of their knock-out Eliminator clash against Washington Freedom on Thursday in Dallas. The skipper hasn't scored a lot of runs in the competition but has the fourth-best strike rate of 166.15.\nPollard plays an important middle-order role which, if he's ruled out, would be difficult to replicate. MI will likely go with Dewald Brevis and Pooran, and Tim David will be asked to finish the innings as well as hold the middle order together.\nCheck out India Squad for World Cup 2023 \u0026 South Africa Squad for World Cup 2023.

  "body": "Watch: Nicholas Pooran smashed one of the greatest T20 centuries in the final of the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket yesterday (July 30) leading his team MI New York to a maiden title.\nHaving won the toss, New York decided to field first and were given a target of 184 after Quinton de Kock carried the Seattle Orcas innings with a 52-ball 87 at the top.\nFor New York, Trent Boult picked 3-34 in four overs, while Rashid Khan was at his miserly best, giving away just nine runs in his four overs and picking three wickets to go with it.\nIn response, New York lost their first wicket off the third ball of the innings when Imad Wasim cleaned up Steven Taylor. Pooran arrived at No.3 and set the stage on fire immediately.\nHe hit his second and third balls – the last two of the first over of the innings – for sixes. The third over, bowled by Dwaine Pretorius, went for 28 runs, including three sixes and two fours, while the last over of the powerplay bowled by Andrew Tye went for 18, including three more sixes.\nBy the end of six overs, New York had raced to 80-2, with Pooran scoring 69 of those. And he did not relent after that either. He hit four more boundaries in the next two overs and reached his hundred in the 12th off just 40 balls.\nA chase that had looked difficult on paper when at the beginning was turned into a cakewalk. By the end of the 12th over, New York needed only 49 in 48 balls.\nPooran scored 37 off the last 17 balls he faced after his hundred, and New York completed the chase on the last ball of the 16th over when he squeezed out a Cameron Gannon yorker to the fine leg fence to collapse on the pitch and let out a roar.\nWith this victory, the Mumbai Indians brand have now won the inaugural editions of the Women’s Premier League and Major League Cricket this year, to go along with their five IPL and two Champions League trophies.\n𝓞𝓷 𝓻𝓮𝓹𝓮𝓪𝓽 🔄\nCan’t stop watching @nicholaspooran’s 1️⃣3️⃣ sixes he hit today‼️ #MLC2023 #MLCFINAL pic.twitter.com/OynKTi2xnD\n— Major League Cricket (@MLCricket) July 31, 2023\n\nSubscribe to the Wisden Cricket YouTube channel for post-match analysis, player interviews, and much more.\nIf you enjoyed this story, please share with your fellow cricket fans and team-mates\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n12 Issues for just £39.99\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox.\n\"It's such a lame excuse\"\nFollow on:\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox."

The 18-day tournament which begins on July 13, 2023, at Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, Texas, will feature some of the biggest stars in world cricket taking part alongside the United States’ best domestic talent.\nThe new program expands Cricket Victoria’s existing global footprint which includes an ongoing cricket development relationship with Japan Cricket, as well as having hosted and worked closely with international teams competing in World Cups and English county cricket teams at its headquarters in St Kilda over the last three years.\nThe initial phase of the partnership in 2023 will see Cricket Victoria and the San Francisco side focus on building their team ahead of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket, but ultimately could lead to a number of high-performance oriented initiatives that will provide opportunities for Victoria’s emerging talent as well as the chance to US-based players to learn and grow within Victorian cricket.\nThe professional services agreement with the San Francisco franchise, and its lead investors Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan (both Founding Partners of Rocketship VC and leading Bay Area entrepreneurs), focuses on preparing the team for on-field success during the inaugural season of MLC.\nCricket Victoria representatives will be in attendance at the iconic Space Center Houston, the official Visitor Center of NASA Johnson Space Center, on March 19 for the inaugural MLC Player Draft, as they assist in compiling a talented squad for the San Francisco franchise ahead of MLC’s inaugural season.\nCricket Victoria CEO Nick Cummins said the partnership with the Bay Area based franchise was an exciting prospect.\n“It’s an incredible opportunity and we’re excited to see how it unfolds over the months ahead. We’ve had very productive conversations with MLC and the lead investors of the San Francisco team over the last few months which have led us to this point,” Cummins said.\n“Beyond that, we have a responsibility to present new opportunities to Victorian cricket. In a rapidly evolving global cricket landscape, we believe our partnership with San Francisco and MLC gives us a chance to do just that.”\nLead investors of the San Francisco MLC franchise, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, said:\n“As MLC launches a new era for the game of cricket here in the US, this important partnership with Cricket Victoria represents a significant step for our San Francisco-based MLC franchise. In our discussions to date, we have been delighted to see Cricket Victoria demonstrate their capability and expertise to support our on-field ambitions with a best-in-class approach. We’re excited to build this partnership and accelerate our preparations ahead of Major League Cricket’s inaugural season this year.”\nSameer Mehta, Co-founder of Major League Cricket, said:\n“Following the announcement of the partnership between the Washington D.C. MLC franchise and Cricket NSW last month, we are thrilled that another globally recognized cricket organization like Cricket Victoria shares our vision to advance the sport of cricket in the United States. Cricket Victoria’s experience in growing the Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades to become two of Australia’s most recognizable sporting franchises will provide invaluable assistance to the San Francisco MLC franchise ahead of the upcoming season.”\nMajor League Cricket will be the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States.

The Super Kings put up 181/6 in their 20 overs before bundling the Knight Riders out for 112 in just 14 overs.\nThe Knight Riders found it difficult to get their innings going right from the start as speedster Rusty Theron dismissed Martin Guptill and Rilee Rossouw in the very first over. Calvin Savage and Gerald Coetzee backed up Theron's effort by sending Nitish Kumar and Unmukt Chand back to the pavilion in quick succession. The Knight Riders were reeling at 20/4 in the fourth over.\nAndre Russell gave a sliver of hope to the Knight Riders when he smashed a six and two fours off Coetzee in the fourth over, however, he kept losing partners at the other end. Captain Sunil Narine and Russell put the Knight Riders at a decent position at 103/5 at the end of the eleventh over, however, Mohsin got the Super Kings back into the game with two wickets in the twelfth over.\n\nALSO READ | With its own Major League, cricket looks for a foothold in the United States\nDwayne Bravo put the final nail in the coffin when he dismissed Russell for 55 runs off 34 balls in the thirteenth over with the Knight Riders 73 runs away from the target. Mohsin wrapped up the match in the very next over with the wickets of Adam Zampa and Lockie Ferguson.\nEarlier in the day, the Los Angeles Knight Riders won the toss and put Texas Super Kings into bat. Devon Conway got the Texas Super Kings off to a flying start with three boundaries in the first over, however, Lockie Ferguson dismissed Captain Faf du Plessis on the first delivery of the second over. The Knight Riders' bowlers continued to shine as Ali Khan sent Lahiru Milantha packing for 17 runs off 14 balls in the sixth over.\nBut thereafter, the two experienced campaigners, Devon Conway and David Miller changed the momentum of the match through a 77-run partnership in just 49 balls. Conway took charge against fast bowler Corné Dry and struck him for two boundaries in the seventh over before Miller also struck two fours off Dry in the ninth over. Miller found a maximum in each of the tenth, eleventh and thirteenth overs and took the Super Kings to 113/2 in 13 overs.\nThe Texas franchise kept losing wickets at regular intervals after Conway fell to Adam Zampa in the fourteenth over for a fantastic innings of 55 runs from 37 balls. However, Mitchell Santner and Dwayne Bravo smashed four sixes between them in the last few overs to help the Super Kings post a formidable total of 181/6 in their 20 overs.\nBrief Scores: Texas Super Kings 181/6 (David Miller 61, Devon Conway 55, Lockie Ferguson 2/23) beat Los Angeles Knight Riders (Andre Russell 55, Jaskaran Malhotra 22, Mohammad Mohsin 4/8) by 69 runs.\n  Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp\nO\n    P\n    E\n    N\nComments\n\nDisclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

  "body": "Watch: Casual running between the wickets cost Finn Allen his wicket in an MLC 2023 match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.\nDespite some tight bowling from Carmi le Roux (4-0-29-0) and Marcus Stoinis (4-0-28-0), the Seattle Orcas posted 177-4 in the fourth match of the 2023 MLC after Wayne Parnell won the toss and opted to bat. The big innings came from Heinrich Klaasen (53 in 31 balls).\nIn response, Finn Allen blocked the first ball he faced and edged the second, from Imad Wasim, before exploding in characteristic fashion.\nHe hit Imad for six. When Parnell replaced Imad for the third over, Allen went four, dot, six, four, four, four, racing to 28 off nine balls.\nMatthew Wade then flicked the first ball of the next over, from Cameron Gannon, for a run. At this point, San Francisco were 42-0 in 3.1 overs: they needed 136 in 101 balls with all their wickets in hand.\nBack on strike, Allen turned the ball towards mid-wicket and jogged for a single. Former Sri Lanka international Shehan Jayasuriya, playing as a local player in the US-based competition, threw the ball at the non-striker’s end.\nDespite the casual jog, Allen had his ground covered. He now tried to plunge his bat into the crease. He had timed it correctly, but his calculations were foiled by his bat, which got stuck in the turf.\nAs the bat fell from Allen’s hand, the ball hit the stumps, and the umpire ruled Allen run out.\nWade followed not too long afterwards, but Stoinis and captain Aaron Finch took San Francisco to 86-2. Then they perished in the space of three balls, and Seattle bowled out San Francisco for 142 as Gannon claimed 4-23. The only resistance came from Shadab Khan (37 in 23 balls).\nWHAT JUST HAPPENED⁉️ \nWas this the only way Finn Allen could get out tonight?  \nHEADS-UP play and a BEAUTIFUL throw from Shehan Jayasuriya!\n4⃣2⃣/1⃣ (3.2) pic.twitter.com/GZk5bkYG4Q\n— Major League Cricket (@MLCricket) July 16, 2023\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please share with your fellow cricket fans and team-mates\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n12 Issues for just £39.99\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox.\n\"It's such a lame excuse\"\nFollow on:\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox."

It’s not really like other T20 leagues that are using existing facilities in cricket-mad countries.”\nThough cricket remains a niche sport in the US it has been around for a long time in the country — the first international cricket match took place in New York in 1844 with the US taking on Canada.\nThe MLC could be cricket’s vehicle to break into a sporting landscape dominated by baseball, basketball and American football,  Dunmore said.\n“We’re cracking a new market for the sport,” he added. “Cricket hasn’t really broken into a major new market for some time.\n“So this is a chance not only to do that, but to do it in the world’s biggest commercial market.”\nDunmore said cricket’s existing fan base in the US made it the sport’s fifth-largest market.\n“If we slice off even a small percentage of the rest of the population, you’ve got a massive market.”\nWest Indies’ Kieron Pollard, one of the first players to fully embrace franchise cricket, was confident MLC would take cricket “prime time” in the US, even though others had failed to break open the market.\n“Obviously before MLC, different people have tried different things,” the 36-year-old, who leads the league’s New York franchise, said.\n“But now the difference is the backing of the Indian franchises and the international players that are coming.”\nSuccess on the global stage would help boost cricket’s profile in the US, and while there has been no big breakthrough as yet Pollard said they are getting closer.\nA US team featuring players mostly of Indian origin made it to the 50-overs World Cup qualifiers in June but failed to make the cut for the main tournament in India later this year.\nBut the experience of rubbing shoulders with the likes of former SA captain Faf du Plessis and England international Jason Roy would stand them in good stead, Pollard said.\n“It augurs well for US cricket, and hopefully the young talent that is there in America can use this opportunity to grow into better international cricketers,” he added.\nCo-hosting the T20 World Cup next year with West Indies will also give the game a boost in the US.\nThe launch of the MLC assumes even more importance coming at a time when the International Cricket Council (ICC) is lobbying for the game’s Olympic inclusion at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\nDunmore said the MLC was providing cricket much-needed visibility as the game bids to return to the Olympics for the first time since 1900.\n“The crowds and the excitement, the buzz, the media attention both in the US and globally, now that’s truly helpful,” he added.\nICC CEO Geoff Allardice acknowledged the buzz MLC has created in the US.\n“There are a number of developments in the US that are helping to raise awareness of the game.\n“The start of the MLC is one of them, they draw a lot of attention to the sport,” Allardice said last week.\nReuters\nWould you like to comment on this article?

  "body": "Listen to Story\nAustralia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has said that Major League Cricket could negatively affect the popularity of T20 Blast. Maxwell played for Birmingham Bears in this year's T20 Blast.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio, Maxwell said T20 Blast could be affected negatively with the advent of the popular MLC. In the previous T20 Blast season, Maxwell scored 248 runs from 14 matches at an average of 17.71, while striking at 153.08.\n“I think now the Major League Cricket tournament's come in, that's going to affect the Blast really badly. When you've got an opportunity to go over to America for two weeks, compared to 14 games here with a stressful schedule where you're travelling all over the place,” said Maxwell.\nHe went on to say that the fixture list of T20 Blast is packed which can really drain the players physically and mentally. MLC kick-started on July 14 with Texas Super Kings defeating LA Knight Riders in the opening match.\n\n“There was one week where we played on a Tuesday in Durham, Thursday in Leeds and then Friday here in Birmingham - that's three games in four days with a day's travel in between. It can really drain you, your body and mentally,” Maxwell added.\nThe Australian said Major League Cricket looks more attractive and can pull bigger crowds, while having a shorter schedule. \n\n“I found that very tough this year and I think with the Major League being a lot more attractive, bigger crowds, I think there's eight [six] overseas players per team, the excitement of a new tournament, it's only two weeks long. Less of a burden on your schedule. I think it's going a lot more attractive to some overseas players,” said Maxwell.\nMaxwell is not part of the Australian Test side which is currently facing England in the five-match Ashes 2023 series, with the fourth match of the series set to be played at Old Trafford in Manchester.\n"

  "body": "Watch: Pakistan-born American leg spinner Mohammad Mohsin picked two wickets off two balls, one of which involved pinning MI New York captain Kieron Pollard plumb in front first ball, to lead Texas Super Kings’ defence of 154.\nBatting first after winning the toss, Texas Super Kings had put up 154-7 at the Grand Prairie Stadium. Devon Conway led the way, scoring 74 off 55 balls, while Faf du Plessis was bowled off a high full toss by Kagiso Rabada for eight. Mitchell Santner chipped in with a crucial 13-ball knock of 27 towards the end.\nNew York lost opener Monank Patel for a duck but recovered quickly to set up a solid platform to launch towards the end. They brought down the target to 64 in 42 balls with seven wickets in hand.\nMohsin had bowled two overs by then, for 26 runs, 18 of which came in his second over – the 10th of the innings. Shayan Jahangir and Tim David were at the crease when he came on to bowl his third – the 14th of the innings.\nJahangir failed to score off the first ball, and stepped out to hit the second. He ended up missing the ball and was stumped by a huge margin.\nThat wicket brought New York captain Pollard to the crease. Pollard has a weakness against balls targeted at the stumps by leg spinners. Mohsin played on that weakness, and caught him plumb in front of the very next ball, denting New York’s chances significantly.\nHe ended up giving just two runs in that over and gave eight more in his fourth to finish with figures of 2-36. Texas won by 17 runs, a major reason for which turned out to be Mohsin’s double-wicket over.\n“OK GOOGLE-Y, GET ME TWO WICKETS!”🎙️\nMohammad Mohsin demonstrates the control of his SIGNATURE GOOGLY to get TWO massive wickets!♾ pic.twitter.com/K8N0RZF5NI\n— Major League Cricket (@MLCricket) July 18, 2023\n\nSubscribe to the Wisden Cricket YouTube channel for post-match analysis, player interviews, and much more.\nIf you enjoyed this story, please share with your fellow cricket fans and team-mates\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n12 Issues for just £39.99\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox.\n\"It's such a lame excuse\"\nFollow on:\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox."

At 115.6 kph, it had no pace for Pollard to work with, but it was too short.\nPollard rocked back and used brute force to dispatch it into the stands over deep mid-wicket. At 110 metres, this remains the biggest six of MLC 2023.\nPooran (68 in 34 balls, three fours, seven sixes) and Pollard (34 in 18, one four, three sixes) added 67 in 36 balls before falling in the space of three balls. Trent Boult (20 in six balls, one four, two sixes) then propelled New York to 194-8 as Imad Wasim finished with 2-23 and Harmeet Singh with 2-21.\nHowever, even that turned out to be inadequate. Nauman Anwar made 51 in 30 balls (six fours, three sixes) before Heinrich Klaasen (110 not out in 44 balls, nine fours, seven sixes) saw Seattle home with four balls to spare even as Boult returned figures of 4-31.\nONE HUNDRED… AND TEN METERS!😱\nKieron Pollard with the BIGGEST SIX of #MajorLeagueCricket!\n1⃣1⃣4⃣/3⃣ (11.2) pic.twitter.com/QGvQ2j2Lvs\n— Major League Cricket (@MLCricket) July 25, 2023\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please share with your fellow cricket fans and team-mates\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n12 Issues for just £39.99\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox.\n\"It's such a lame excuse\"\nFollow on:\nGet the latest news, recommended reading and offers sent to your inbox."

Lockie Ferguson bowled the ball outside off stump and du Plessis attempted to drive but only managed to send it to short extra cover, where Unmukt Chand took an easy catch.\nDu Plessis, who celebrated his 39th birthday on July 13, may not have had much to celebrate with the bat, but he walked away a happy man after the game as his team defeated LAKR by 69 runs.\nfirst ball duck for Faf du Plessis! tough way to start a new league and season.

Sri Lankan captain Dasun Shanaka is not in the best of forms but is a more than handy middle order batter. On the contrary, Zimbabwean all-rounder Sikandar Raza has been in a purple patch over the last couple of years.\nQuinton de Kock is as good behind the stumps as he is in front of them and the opener is known for bashing the bowlers to all parts in the powerplay. Compatriot Wayne Parnell can be a genuine wicket-taker with the new ball.\nWashington Freedom do not have the biggest names in the business, but in Anrich Nortje, Wanindu Hasaranga, Marco Jansen, Glenn Phillips, Adam Milne, Moises Henriques and Josh Philippe, they have gone for some smart buys.\nTheir bowling is clearly stronger than their batting with Anrich Nortje, Wanindu Hasaranga, Marco Jansen and Adam Milne in the mix.

  "body": "US ambassador to India says sport’s inclusion will ignite new generation of players, fans \nThe United States' ambassador to India believes his compatriots will come to share his joy in the \"unabashed fun\" of Twenty20 cricket when the format features at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\nInternational cricket's shortest form was approved as one of five new sports for LA 2028 during the International Olympic Committee's session in Mumbai on Monday.\nFlag football, baseball/softball, lacrosse and squash were the others.\nEric Garcetti, a former mayor of Los Angeles, told reporters in Mumbai late Monday that his passion for cricket had grown during his time living in the UK, but blossomed after he took his post in India six months ago.\n\"I became a real fan when I came here and the T20 format, because it's so fast,\" he said.\n\"Most of us don't have a few days to watch a Test match or an entire seven-hour stretch for a World Cup match. But here to see two or three hours of unabashed fun, I'm a convert.\"\nCricket's only previous appearance at the Olympics was during the 1900 Games in Paris, where a team from Great Britain defeated France in a lone match.\n\n\"This is a great day for the Olympic movement, a great day for India, a great day for the United States and a great day for cricket fans everywhere,\" said Garcetti.\n\"I think it will ignite a new generation of cricket players and cricket fans... We think that this format is perfect for the Olympics, perfect for cricket, and no better place to launch than here, in the middle of cricket madness.\"\nThe Indian Premier League, featuring the game's global stars, has cemented India's position as the unquestioned economic driving force of the sport, thanks to legions of fans and lucrative broadcasting deals in a nation where the game is almost a religion.\nMonday's vote also took place while India stages the men's 50-over Cricket World Cup.\nMajor League Cricket, a professional Twenty20 League, launched in the United States in July, with the US a co-host of next year's men's T20 World Cup together with territories in the West Indies.\n\"By the time of the Olympics, not only Major League Cricket will be significant in the US, we'll have the facilities and the fanbase,\" said Garcetti.\nOn a more serious note, Garcetti voiced his support for the concept of the Olympic truce, amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\"The tradition of the Olympics was the Olympic truce,\" he said.\n\"In ancient times, everybody put down their weapons to have sports unite us... So we hope that this inspires people that peace is better than war, that participating together is better than conflict.\"\nFacebook Conversations\n 3.46M\nHaunting the Silver Screen: The Evolution of Cult-Horror in Pakistan | Express Tribune\nPakistan vs India: The Cricket Rivalry - The Express Tribune || IND vs PAK\nThe World of Pakistani Science Fiction | The Express Tribune\nFading Glory: The Story of Hockey's Decline in Pakistan\nPost-Lockdown Pakistani Pop Revolution - The Express Tribune\nWhy do Pakistanis keep marrying their cousins? - The Express Tribune\nCombatting Climate change | Effects of Climate change | Express Tribune\nBeans to Brews: The Journey of Coffee | The Express Tribune\nThe chai drinking culture in Pakistan | Express Tribune\nUnmasking Colourism in Pakistan | The Express Tribune\nWhy do Pakistani studios love Eid?\nThe extraordinary moon landing of Chandrayaan-3\nOscar-winner Yeoh voted onto IOC\nIOC Session backs double award of 2030 and 2034 Winter Games\nIOC made 'only decision' in banning Russia\nIOC suspends Russian Olympic Committee over Ukraine move\n‘Massive day’ as cricket approved for LA Games\nCricket set for shot at Olympic glory\nAshraf honours Blind Cricket Team\nCricket cracker to hammer blow\nFIA to blacklist passports of professional beggars\nLists of Afghans eligible for asylum sought\nSC clarifies procedure act appeal rules\nIndia resorts to unprovoked firing along Working Boundary\nAt UN, Iran warns US will 'not be spared' if war in Gaza continues\nOutgoing G-B bureaucrat's legacy endures \nTable Talk: Noi Stir Fry\nThe Home Edit\nThe Runway Edit \n\n\nجنوبی افریقا کیخلاف میچ کیلئے قومی ٹیم میں دو تبدیلیاں متوقع\n\n\n\n\nسرفراز احمد ورلڈ کپ میں قومی ٹیم کی پرفارمنس پر دل گرفتہ\n\n\n\n\nورلڈ کپ: پوائنٹس ٹیبل پر پاکستان سے پانچویں پوزیشن بھی چھن گئی\n\n\n\n\nمکی آرتھر نے پاکستان کرکٹ ٹیم سے ’غیرمعمولی پرفارمنس‘ کی امید لگالی\n\n\n\n\nورلڈ کپ: دفاعی چیمپئن انگلینڈ سری لنکا سے بھی ہار گیا\n\n\n\n\nکراچی ریجن نے قائداعظم ٹرافی جیت لی، سرفراز احمد پلیئر آف دی ٹورنامنٹ قرار\n\n\nEconomic interests and India’s blanket support to Israel\nCollapse of Afghan republic — US policy review\nInvestigation — capacity of police\nPakistan needs a different leadership\nHunger is the mother of all curses\nHows and whys of rising fundamentalism in Balochistan\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten,\nredistributed or derived from.

  "body": "\n{{suggest.tag}}\nSearch for “”\n After the box office success of Major League Cricket (MLC), American Cricket Enterprises (owners of MLC) are keen to ride the momentum onto its pathway league Minor League Cricket (MiLC), launching this weekend. The 26 team franchise affair is touted to be a semi professional league underpinning the MLC, a developmental league on the lines of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. The tournament, spanning over 2 months, will see over 150 T20 games being played over 15 states in the US. \n There have been major overhauls in the makeup of the squads that took the field last year. Defending champions, Seattle Thunderbolts have been severely impacted by the spate of departures as captain Harmeet Singh, Andries Gous, Shubham Ranjane and Phani Simhadri move down to the Central and Southern Conference teams. \n In a surprise move, Silicon Valley Strikers parted ways with captain Unmukt Chand who's been the most prolific batter of the league over two seasons apart from having the Strikers lift the silverware in the inaugural season. Former Pakistan and MI New York allrounder, Hammad Azam will now be at Dallas Mustangs. Azam was named the MVP of the inaugural season before an injury laden second season mostly saw him out of action for Golden State Grizzlies. A slew of PSL cricketers will call quits to Pakistan cricket after qualifying as local cricketers in the MiLC including the likes of former Pakistan U19 captain Hassan Khan, Imran Khan Jnr. and Zia ul Haq. \n The league will also see USA national players in action as they strive to remain relevant in the wake of cricketers like Corey Anderson, Harmeet Singh, Smit Patel and Shadley Van Schalkwyk qualifying for the national team after serving their cool off period. Skipper Monank Patel will make his way across the Hudson to play for the New Jersey Stallion after appearing for the Empire State Titans last year. Steven Taylor is set to miss the season owing to his CPL commitments with the Jamaica Tallawahs. \n \"The recent success of Major League Cricket shows the strong appetite for cricket in America and the long-term plan to build American cricket is dependent on a successful pipeline of talent coming through Minor League Cricket,\" said Zubin Surkari, Tournament Director, Minor League Cricket. \"The third season of MiLC will allow fans to see many players who featured in MLC up close while giving the next generation of American cricket stars the chance to shine.\" \n The 26 teams are divided into Atlantic and Pacific Conferences. The Atlantic conference is further segregated into eastern and southern divisions while the Pacific conference is further bifurcated into western and central divisions. The league stage and playoff rounds will culminate in a finals week at the Grand Prairie Stadium, the site of the MLC final, on October 6-7. "

However, the investment the league has attracted and the hope that it could lead to a cricket revolution in the USA has already made it the cynosure of all eyes.\nBefore the MLC kicks off, here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming T20 league.\nIs USA a cricket playing country?\nYes, they are an Associate member of the ICC with ODI status and took part in the recently concluded ICC ODI World Cup 2023 Qualifiers in Zimbabwe. In fact, USA were also part of the first cricket match involving two countries in 1844.

They have partnered with Australia’s Cricket Victoria to run the franchise. Washington Freedom, owned by Sanjay Govil, have partnered with Cricket New South Wales.\nTV broadcast and live streaming\nWillow TV has the broadcast right for USA and Canada. The MLC will be shown live on Sports18 and JioTV in India.\nWhich big names will take part in MLC?\nA galaxy of stars will descend on the USA for the MLC including Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Rashid Khan, Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Jason Roy, Trent Boult, Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway, David Miller, Quinton de Kock, Shimron Hetmyer and Anrich Nortje among others.\nIs there a cap on overseas players?\nIn MLC, each franchise can have a maximum of 19 players and a minimum of 16. They need to have a minimum of 10 domestic players including at least one U23 USA player. In the playing XI, teams can have a maximum of six overseas players.\nAre there Indian players in MLC?\nThere are quite a few of them.

Well, not packing out to the rafters (yet). However, it’s a valid competition in a nation with a huge Indian expat population, amongst others. Arguably there’s potential to gain a solid foothold. And with the Texas Super Kings taking on the Los Angeles Knight Riders, the IPL franchising is helping connect to that demographic.\nDespite the early loss of Faf du Plessis for a golden duck, Devon Conway with 55 and David Miller 61 underpinned the Super Kings’ 181-6 over 20 overs. \nThe venue is a former baseball venue that was adapted to also host soccer. It’s now been redeveloped to be the Super Kings’ home ground – under lease to American Cricket Enterprises who are partnering USA Cricket. The original 5400-seat stadium is now to be not just a MLC venue but also a high performance centre for USA Cricket.\nIt had also been regarded as one of the best sports performance facilities in Minor League Baseball during its tenure with the now folded Texas AirHogs. \nThe long-term lease agreement with the City of Grand Prairie shows a determination for the medium term at least to sufficiently crack the US market.\nShould cricket crack the USA – sufficiently – with a goal of full ICC membership by 2030, what might that mean for close neighbours in the Caribbean? Could cricket in the West Indies undergo a much-needed resurgence? It may be the last chance for the West Indies to not be completely consumed by the combination of baseball, basketball and soccer. It would be wonderful if cricket in the West Indies could leverage off this in some way.\nThe LA Knight Riders lost Guptill 3 balls in and never gained any top order momentum; soon collapsing to 4-20. Eventually dismissed for just 112 off 14 overs, the only bright spot being a breezy 55 from Andre Russell with seven 4s and three 6s. \nIt’s especially vital that the old baseball diamond is gone. This is not a venue of compromise – a key element of the development being the conversion to an international size and quality cricket field capable of hosting major international competitions. Additionally, the plans include a number of training nets and batting ‘lanes’, as well as two additional outside turf fields that will be used for training and by the affiliated MLC academies.\nCrucial to this push for cricket in the USA is that it’s not just pie in the sky wishful thinking. And it is being driven by significant funding from investor groups driving the unprecedented cricket infrastructure development for the US. This brings the best cricketers to play at cricket specific venues with natural turf wickets and quality spectator amenity. And plans for high performance development of talent.\nSome of the investors include Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) and Soma Somasegar (MD of Madrona Venture Group) amongst others from the business world. A group of investors very keen on making this push a winner.\nIt should be noted that there is reportedly a population of more than 4.5 million Indian-Americans (around 1.35 per cent of the total US population and the largest group of South Asian-Americans after Chinese-Americans). Significantly, Indian-Americans are the highest-earning ethnic group in the US.\nSports opinion delivered daily \n   \nBuild your own fantasy cricket team and put it to the test with Draftstars daily fantasy competitions.  Pick your match, pick your team and watch the points roll in to take out cash prizes on each match.  What are you really gambling with?

  "body": "Written by: SportsCafe Desk\nNarine is appealing in MLC on Friday.\n(Major League Cricket/Twitter)\nKeeping in mind that ‘America is the biggest place in the world for sport’, Liam Plunkett is optimistic about the future of Major League Cricket. The former England pace bowler, in fact, feels MLC could surpass every other franchise league across the world, and will only be behind IPL.\nThe much-anticipated Major League Cricket (MLC) got underway on Friday, with Texas Super Kings thrashing Los Angeles Knight Riders by 69 runs in the curtain-raiser in Dallas. Devon Conway and David Miller starred with the bat, scoring 55 and 61 respectively to help their side post 181/6 before they dismissed Knight Riders for 112 in just 14 overs. Andre Russell top-scored with 55, but the other star batters, including Martin Guptill, and Rilee Rossouw among many others, failed miserably to suffer a thumping defeat.\nIn a recent conversation with BBC, Liam Plunkett was of the opinion about MLC, saying the tournament is here to stay. The former English paceman went on to remark that it could be the biggest T20 tournament in the sport behind the Indian Premier League.\n\"It can be right up there just behind the IPL. Obviously it will be hard to overtake the IPL but MLC is being taken very seriously and America is the biggest place in the world for sport,”  Plunkett told BBC Sport. \"Let's see where that ceiling is. Nobody knows and that's the exciting part, it is unknown. There's huge potential.\"\nThe ongoing MLC will have 19 matches played over two and a half weeks. Six teams – MI New York, Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, Seattle Orcas, San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom – will play up against each other for the prestigious trophy.\nFurther, Plunkett highlighted the Americans are very passionate about sports, and if they see the excitement and buzz around cricket, there will be a massive jump in terms of popularity around it.\n\"Away from cricket, there are all sorts of different sponsorships and partnerships. Who knows where that is going to take some of the superstars of the game?” Plunkett added. \"When Americans get excited about something, they go above and beyond. Like the Indians, they are very passionate. With these players coming across, it shows there's massive excitement. They want to be here because if it takes off, it could be huge.\"\nSportsCafe Desk\nOn a quest to update the Indian sports fan with real-time, insightful and engaging content.\nView all Articles"

  "body": "Home » Major League Cricket signs long-term lease to develop first MLC Stadium in Grand Prairie\nGRAND PRAIRIE, TX – Major League Cricket (MLC) has received approval from the City of Grand Prairie on a long-term lease agreement to begin an extensive redevelopment of AirHogs Stadium as the organization’s first major cricket stadium in the United States. The parent company of MLC, American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) — in cooperation with USA Cricket, the national governing body for cricket in the United States — has retained the internationally renowned design firm HKS to repurpose and design what will be a world-class stadium for cricket in the United States.\nOne of the best sports performance facilities in minor league baseball during its previous life as the home of the Texas AirHogs, the soon-to-be renamed stadium will now become a dedicated world-class cricketing facility. The redevelopment of the venue is scheduled to take place throughout 2021 before playing host to the Texas MLC franchise that is planned to launch in 2022, as well as a base for the USA Cricket National team and a premier High Performance Center.\n“As the first Major League Cricket stadium in the United States, Grand Prairie represents a seminal moment for the sport in America, and we are incredibly excited to partner with the City of Grand Prairie to bring Major League Cricket to Dallas,” said Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders of ACE and MLC. “Grand Prairie’s centralized location in the U.S. and the thriving Texas cricketing community, allied with the quality of the facility, made it the perfect site for us and we are certain that this is the beginning of a fruitful long-term partnership with the City that will bring much success.”\n\nThe City of Grand Prairie is an ideal location for a premier cricket stadium in Texas, with its strong cricket fan base and demographics in surrounding areas, favorable time zone for broadcast in major international cricket markets, and Dallas-Fort Worth’s pedigree for major sports teams and stadiums. The new cricket stadium will see the existing baseball diamond converted to an international size and quality cricket field capable of hosting major international competitions, a number of training nets and batting lanes added, as well as two additional outside turf fields that will be used for training and by the affiliated MLC academies. Upon completion, it will be the most extensive fully-dedicated cricket facility in the United States. \nThe venue will also be a centerpiece of USA Cricket’s efforts to bring major international events to the United States, including regional International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup and T20 World Cup Qualifiers for Men and Women, Cricket World Cup League 2 series, and International Series against local rivals Canada and the West Indies, as well as other contemporary nations. The stadium will also be a featured aspect of USA Cricket’s efforts to bring the ICC T20 World Cup and other major events to the United States by 2031, in a process that is ongoing as part of a joint bid with Cricket West Indies.\n“We are very excited about this opportunity to bring cricket to Texas by converting our minor league baseball stadium,” said Grand Prairie Mayor Ron Jensen. “Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world behind soccer, with a large and growing audience in the states. We look forward to an exciting future with our partners.”\nThe redeveloped stadium is slated to be ready for cricket in Spring 2022, but will serve as a key High Performance center for the USA Cricket Men’s and Women’s National Teams and other key youth and zonal cricket squads during the interim. The Men’s National Team is currently ranked 19th in the world, having gained One Day International status for the first time in 2019. The USA Women’s National Team will be attempting to qualify for the ICC Women’s World Cup for the first time next year, having advanced to the global qualifier in 2019.\n“In association with our partners at ACE, we now have a world-class facility to develop our domestic talent and help us fulfill the goals we announced in our Foundational Plan,” said Paraag Marathe, USA Cricket Chairman. “The successful development of a cricket-dedicated stadium has long been a priority for us, and it is a significant stride forward for the growth of cricket in America. We also look forward to bringing international cricket events, and the crowds that go with them, to our new stadium, and to help introduce the sport to a broader audience.”\n\nUSA Cricket has recently undergone a significant transformation that includes the release of the organization’s first Foundational Plan with a vision to establish cricket as a leading sport in the USA and become a full member of the International Cricket Council by 2030. Cricket is the world’s second-most popular sport in terms of global viewership, attracting billions of viewers worldwide with a significant, growing American fanbase. USA Cricket counts more than 150,000 regular players across the country, with roughly 20 million fans and more than 4 million regular viewers of cricket.\nHonored by Ballpark Digest as the Best New Ballpark in 2008 following its inaugural season, AirHogs Stadium served as the home of the Texas AirHogs of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball for 12 years. The stadium, located conveniently between Arlington and Dallas, is adjacent to Lone Star Park horse racing track and The Theater at Grand Prairie, currently seats a capacity of 5,445 and features 13 luxury suites and ample space for improved amenities to enhance the experience of fans and cricketers alike. The stadium will be repurposed to be completely dedicated for cricket, with an increase in the seating capacity planned to accommodate more than 8,000 spectators with additional and upgraded hospitality features.\nAlong with the changing demographics of the Dallas region that have made the area a prime location for the grassroots development of cricket, the sport has seen recent progress domestically at the professional level. Following a player draft in August this year, Minor League Cricket (MiLC) successfully staged a series of exhibition matches over five weeks, the largest national cricket competition in U.S. history. The best amateur cricketers in the U.S. combined with 36 first-class and international players to play 51 competitive and entertaining T20 matches across 17 venues involving 18 of the 24 MiLC franchises with 312 drafted players competing in at least one match. ACE is preparing to launch its full inaugural MiLC T20 cricket season in May 2021, with MLC expected to start its competition in 2022.\n\nMajor League Cricket, which is exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, represents the most ambitious and transformational venture ever undertaken in the American cricket landscape. Focused on staging the highest quality T20 cricket for U.S. cricket fans, MLC will feature top international cricketers from around the globe, and provide a stage for domestic cricketers to showcase their talents to a global audience.\nAs the ICC’s member body for the United States, USA Cricket selected MLC as its exclusive partner for the development of a professional T20 cricket league. As exemplified by this establishment of AirHogs Stadium as a High Performance Training Center for USA Cricket, MLC provides support for both the USA’s Men’s and Women’s teams, with the goal of elevating them to the highest level of international competition.\nThe founders of MLC have been deeply involved with cricket in the U.S. for years, particularly with the establishment of the U.S. as a major broadcast market for the sport. MLC is co-founded by the founders of Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America and the principals of The Times of India Group, India’s largest media conglomerate. MLC is also backed by a prominent and diverse group of investors from across the U.S.\nUSA Cricket\n17304 Preston Rd, Suite 800\nDallas, TX 75252\nTel: 972-980-3959\n[email protected]\n© 2023 USA Cricket.

His platonic relationship with sports had always been there since childhood, but Cricket managed to strike a special, intimate nerve of his heart. Although his initial dream of playing the sport at the highest level couldn't come to fruition, Gurpreet did represent the state of Jharkhand at the under-14 level. However, almost like taking a pledge to never let the undying passion for Cricket fade away even a tad, he made sure to continue the love relationship by assigning the field of journalism as an indirect Cupid. He thus, first finished his bachelor's in journalism and then pursued the PG Diploma course in English journalism from the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC). Soon after and since 2019, he has been working at The Sportsrush. Apart from sports, he takes keen interest in politics, and in understanding women and gender-related issues.\nAdvertisement\nCopyright: © RU Sport Private Limited.

  "body": "USA cricket's ambitious project - the Major League Cricket (MLC) - had its first-ever local players draft on Sunday (March 19). Six MLC franchises, with four of those partly or fully owned by Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises, got their thinking caps on and drafted 54 cricketers in their respective squads. \nOf these 54 cricketers classified as local residents eligible for draft selection in the 'residents category', notably, only 15 have played for the USA at the junior or the senior international level and only seven of these have been born in the country. \nBut there is no shortage of star attraction in the draft picks made by the franchises in Texas. Over nine rounds of draft selection process, six MLC franchises got nine picks each, including USA-based talents. The franchises also confirmed six marquee overseas signings. \nThe tournament rules had allowed the franchises to sign overseas players separately with a reported budget of USD 800,000 for the bracket. For the local player draft, ESPNcricinfo had reported, franchises had 300,000 USD available up their sleeves. \nAlso Read: Chennai Super Kings buy Texas-based Major League Cricket franchise in USA\n \nThe draft saw nine rounds of selection and players being assigned their respective teams over the course of the entire process in Texas. Former New Zealand and South African cricketers Corey Anderson and Rusty Theron were the first picks at the draft. Anderson went to the San Francisco Unicorns, while Theron was picked by the Team Texas. \nThe Unicorns also signed up former Australian captain Aaron Finch among their marquee overseas signings, apart from retired England seamer Liam Plunkett. Other notable signings from outside the residents category included big names such as Marcus Stoinis (Unicorns), Mitchell Marsh (Seattle Orcas), Anrich Nortje (DC Freedom), Wanindu Hasaranga (Freedom) and Quinton de Kock (Orcas). \nYee (and we cannot stress this enough) haw 🇺🇸  Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Mitch Marsh and Brody Couch are among a number of Aussies heading to the USA this July for the first ever season of Major League Cricket ✍️🤠 pic.twitter.com/dNSmxzOzWL\n Los Angeles Knight Riders swapped up Unmukt Chand, the famed 2012 U-19 World Cup winning Indian skipper, who bid adieu to Indian cricket last year and played the Big Bash League (BBL) as the first-ever overseas Indian pick. Since he is based in the USA now, Chand got counted in the resident's category to the KKR franchise. \nHarmeet Singh, another member of that 2012 side, was picked up the Seattle franchise. Mumbai Indians' based in New York got former USA captain Steven Taylor in their squad. The Knight Riders roped in USA wicketkeeper Jaskaran Malhotra and ex Canada captain Nitish Kumar, apart from Chand. \nThere were several other exciting young picks, including USA U19 left-arm spin allrounder Ali Sheikh, who was drafted in by the Knight Riders, with the tournament regulations compelling franchises to invest in USA-based talents, knowing each playing XI must feature six USA residents. \nAaron Finch\nRetiring from international cricket earlier in the year, Finch is set to take the USA route after being drafted in by the San Francisco Unicorns for the first-ever MLC tournament. Finch is an opener with captaincy experience and will be leading the franchise. \nAnrich Nortje \nNortje continues his Delhi Capitals association by playing for the franchise's USA-based Freedom side. The South African speedster was the headlining aspect of the Freedom squad, set to lead their pace attack in the six-team competition. \nWanindu Hasaranga \nJoining hands with Nortje in the Freedom unit will be Sri Lanka's incisive wristspin sensation and lower-order batting maverick Hasaranga. One of the brightest from the Island nation, Hasaranga will look to add to his T20 stocks with a fruitful campaign in the month-long MLC competition. \nQuinton de Kock \nThe Seattle Orcas made one of the smartest overseas signings. De Kock, who can not blast opposition attacks at the top of the order but also provide safe glovework behind the stumps, brings with him a lot of balance and Stability to the CSK-owned franchise. \nMitchell Marsh \nTalk of balance and stability, Marsh, the Australian fast-bowling allrounder, is another impactful plug along those lines for the Orcas side. Marsh can bat at the top, in the middle, bowl in the middle overs or with the new ball and do it consistently, providing the Orcas think-tank a great deal of flexibility. \nMarcus Stoinis \nLast but certainly not least among the marquee overseas signings in MLC was Stoinis, another Aussie fast-bowling allrounder, with the ability to blast off with the bat in hand and provide impactful utility with the ball. Stoinis will be playing for the Unicorns, where he will enjoy playing under his former Aussie skipper Finch. \nMI New York: Steven Taylor, Hammad Azam, Ehsan Adil, Nosthush Henjige, Monank Patel, Sarbjeet Ladda, Shayan Jahangir, Usman Rafiq, Saideep Ganesh \nSan Francisco Unicorns: Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Corey Anderson, Liam Plunkett, Tajinder Singh, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Carmi Le Roux, Brody Couch, David White, Smit Patel, Sanjay Krishnamurthi \nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Ali Khan, Unmukt Chand, Jaskaran Malhotra, Nitish Kumar, Corne Dry, Ali Sheikh, Saif Badar, Shadley Van Schalhywh, Bhaskar Yadram \nSeattle Orcas: Quinton de Kock, Mitchell Marsh, Harmeet Singh, Shehan Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjani, Cameron Gannon, Aaron Jones, Nauman Anwar, Phani Simhadri, Angelo Perera, Matthew Tromp \nWashington Freedom: Anrich Nortje, Wanindu Hasaranga, Andries Gous, Mukhtar Ahmed, Obus Pienaar, Saurabh Netravalhar, Saad Ali, Dane Piedt, Sujith Gowda, Justin Dill, Akhilesh Bodugum\nTeam Texas: Rusty Theron, Calvin Savage, Lahiru Milantaha, Milind Kumar, Sami Aslam, Cameron Stevenson, Cody Chetty, Zia Shahzad, Saiteja Mukamalla\n© 2022 CRICXTASY MEDIA"

  "source": "ABC News",
  "body": "It's cricket but with a relatively new spin\nGeorge Bernard Shaw asserted “the English are not very spiritual people so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.”\nIt has been a long game, traditionally.\nWhile cricket has flourished in England and some of its former colonies, it has never taken off to the same degree in the United States, where some have perceived it as impenetrable. \nA sport played in its purist form by players in long white uniforms, test cricket goes on for five days and still often ends with no winner, with days so long players twice have to leave the field for meals.\nMajor League Cricket, which begins on Thursday, could change that perception. For a start, the games only go for just over three hours.\nMLC will comprise six teams, from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, New York and Washington, which will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\nTeams will have a maximum of 19 and minimum of 16 players, combining international stars and home-grown players selected through a draft which was made when the league was launched, officially and metaphorically, at Space Center Houston. Each team was allowed to sign nine local players, one of which had to be under-23.\nThe salaries of international players will be drawn from an initial $120 million investment from corporate backers, mainly from India.\nThe teams will play Twenty20 style which might be portrayed as cricket with the dull bits removed. The format may be more appealing to the American sport palate because there is always a winner: if the teams are still tied after both innings — each comprising 20 six-ball overs — a tie-breaking “super over” is played to find the winner.\nMost matches will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, converted to a cricket stadium with 7,200 seats and a grass pitch. Other matches will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nThe league follows the model of professional Twenty20 — or more broadly known as T20 — leagues which already exist in places such as India, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Canada. They're all supported by a travelling troupe of international players — many of them T20 specialists — who give leagues marquee quality.\nThe most lucrative and glamorous of all these franchise competitions is the Indian Premier League, where the world’s best players are hired by teams owned by Bollywood stars, business giants and other celebrities. The gravitational pull of the IPL has reshaped cricket’s traditional schedules and made many new cricketing millionaires.\nMajor League Cricket inevitably will have some of the Indian Premier League glitz. Four of the six teams are owned and will be run by IPL franchises.\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders will be run by the Knight Riders Group which operate the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. MI New York will be run by the Mumbai Indians, Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas by the GMR Group which runs the Delhi Capitals.\nTwo of Australia's provincial organizations — Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales — will run the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom respectively.\nMany of the biggest stars from India, Australia and England are involved in test series — more of those five-day matches — but MLC has attracted a strong contingent of seasoned T20 performers.\nBollywood star Shah Rukh Khan co-owns the Knight Riders Group and has recruited West Indies stars Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, England’s Jason Roy, South Africa's Rilee Rossouw, Australian Adam Zampa and New Zealanders Lockie Ferguson and Martin Guptill.\n“We have assembled a strong and talented team for the debut season of MLC who can compete at the highest level and bring joy to cricket fans around the world,” Knight Riders Group chief executive Venky Mysore said.\nThe Texas Super Kings have hired South Africa’s Faf du Plessis as captain alongside international stars Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, David Miller, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee.\nChennai Super Kings chief executive K.S. Viswanathan said du Plessis “led the Joburg Super Kings at (the South African T20 league) from the front earlier this year and we’re confident of doing well under him in Texas.\"\nThe West Indies and Mumbai Indians star Kieron Pollard will captain New York, which will have Robin Peterson as head coach and Lasith Malinga as bowling coach. Their signings include fast bowlers Trent Boult from New Zealand and Kagiso Rabada from South Africa.\nSeattle has Australian star Mitch Marsh and South Africa’s Quinton de Kock.\nMLC has broader ambitions, to build minor leagues in a bid to develop training and development facilities and support the U.S. national team.\nNow it remains to be seen whether American fans will find Major League Cricket to their taste and make the league itself everlasting.\n___\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

  "body": "With backing from four franchises in the Indian Premier League, including the league's most successful teams the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings, MLC has plenty of money and expertise behind it, unlike prior attempts to crack the American market.\nAs well as financial muscle and television deals, MLC has also been sanctioned by USA Cricket and the International Cricket Council - rubber stamps that have been absent from short-lived private ventures in the past.\nLike the IPL, the league will play the shortest and most explosive version of cricket, Twenty20, and has recruited some experienced international players.\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\nWhile cricket has long been played at a recreational level in the USA - the first-ever international game being between the USA and Canada at New York in 1844 - there remains a shortage of facilities for the sport in a country where baseball is beloved.\nA former baseball park in North Texas, Grand Prairie Stadium, has been transformed into a cricket-specific venue and will be the site of the opener when the Texas Super Kings face the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\nWhile organizers expect good levels of support from fans with family backgrounds in cricket-loving countries, they aim to gradually win over the broader American public.\n\"The goal is to grow the game of cricket and expose the sport in the USA,\" tournament director Justin Geale, told AFP.\n\"We've got some of the best players in the world that can actually represent the product, do it justice. So it's going to be a good quality game of cricket that gives us the best chance to show existing fans and new fans the game.\n\"We've got as far as anyone ever has. So after all the false starts, I think it's finally here.\"\nPart of the groundwork that MLC did was been the creation of Minor League Cricket, a 26-team competition which began in 2021 to spark domestic player development.\nThe teams will feature a maximum of six foreign players and a minimum of five domestic players and Geale says developing a talent pool for the USA national team is a big part of the mission.\n\"Building talent here domestically is one of our big pillars for sustainability,\" he said.\nIt will be a challenge for coaches and captains to manage teams with experienced international players alongside emerging domestic players but South African Robin Peterson, head coach of the Mumbai Indians-backed MI New York team, says it will work.\n\"In my experience, I found that the local boys tend to learn quite a bit playing alongside these superstars,\" he told AFP.\n\"I've seen it firsthand in the SA20 and even if you look at the growth and trajectory of the Indian cricket since the inception of the IPL, it has just been amazing the amount of talent that they're producing.\n\"I see the league here playing a similar role for USA cricket.\"\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\nPeterson is optimistic that T20, much more than longer forms of the game, has the ingredients to win eyeballs in the American market.\n\"It's becoming more entertainment,\" he said. \"It speaks to the American sporting psyche where the players are a lot more physical, fitter, stronger, hit the ball further.\n\"It's an exciting project. I think it's about time people start taking cricket seriously in America.\"\nRetrouvez nos conseils sur joueurs-info-service.fr (09-74-75-13-13, appel non surtaxé)"

  "body": "Although cricket, a sport loved by billions of fans worldwide, has historically been slow to take hold in the United States, the current T20 tournament format offers a fresh opportunity to give the sport a foothold in the lucrative American market. T20 cricket, with games that can be completed in an evening (as opposed to five days for Test cricket and a full day for One-Day cricket) and its focus on fan entertainment, promises to provide a faster-paced, more engaging version of the traditional game. What’s more, with prominent international players taking part in the MLC tournament and games streamed live around the world, the league stands to get the benefit of a sizable international viewing base and multinational sponsors, giving it some runway to establish a dedicated American fan base.\nFor sponsors, the launch of MLC offers unique sponsorship and promotional opportunities and the potential ability to connect and engage with new audiences. Given cricket’s established international fan base in lucrative emerging markets such as India, US brands may view MLC as a new medium through which they can penetrate otherwise difficult-to-reach international markets and customers. In addition, the buzz of a new league in the US and the international star power present during the inaugural season may lead international brands to view MLC as a new opportunity to expand their reach in the US and engage with US consumers.\nThe excitement of the inaugural MLC season and the attention given to MLC also presents potentially lucrative opportunities for MLC and MLC teams and venues to monetize their investment by securing both short-term sponsorship opportunities with brands looking to capitalize on the current excitement and long-term partnerships with sponsors looking to “get in on the ground floor” of MLC and professional cricket in the US as a partner with the sport for years to come.\nThere are numerous risks and considerations that need to be taken into account with any sponsorship or promotional arrangement. Several notable examples include the scope of the sponsorship “category,” category exclusivity (if any), effect of force majeure events and work stoppages, allocation of costs, intellectual property protection, league rules, media rights and broadcast issues, and a whole host of other complex legal and business issues. Both the sponsors, on one hand, and the MLC and MLC teams and venues on the other, will need to create, negotiate, finalize, and activate sponsorship and promotional arrangements which are mutually beneficial for each party, which will likely model the arrangements used in the context of other professional sports leagues, but with modifications to reflect certain unique aspects inherent in the sport of cricket.\nArentFox Schiff’s Sports Practice Group boasts one of the most experienced and diverse sports practices in the country and regularly advises sports organizations (including leagues, conferences, teams, and national governing bodies), players, sponsors, and investors on a broad variety of sports matters, including numerous high-profile naming rights and sponsorship transactions.\nAll Perspectives from Alerts\nLinkedin Twitter Youtube\n© Copyright 2023 ArentFox Schiff LLP.

  "body": "GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas —The promise of cricket in America could be seen and felt in the most unlikely of circumstances. Awash in Friday night lights after a scorching Texas sun, the trim green cricket oval invited fanatics and families alike to watch the Seattle Orcas chase the Washington Freedom’s 144 runs. Deep in the Heart of Texas played cheerfully from the loudspeakers during a brief break in the action, and local law enforcement, sporting straw cowboy hats and boots, looked on in bewilderment. Major League Cricket debuted last week, the cricketing world’s American Dream, a new field of dreams.\nIn 2015, I wrote an article seeking to answer a question: Could cricket in the U.S. be a worthwhile investment? I flew to New York City to watch a tour of the world’s cricketing all-stars because, having fallen in love with the sport thanks to business travel to India and England, I was curious about its viability in America. Not long ago, the idea that Major League Soccer franchises would pop up in cities across America, each competing for international talent, was a dream to some, and a joke to others.\nCricket? It’s too complicated. Don’t matches stretch on for days? It will never work. But might the MLC and the Indian diaspora attract a legend at the end of his career, like MLS and its “soccer is life” Latino population attracted Messi to Miami? The night before Seattle’s match, the Texas Super Kings played the LA Knight Riders to commence tournament play. Ross Perot Jr.’s Super Kings beat the Knight Riders by a score of 181 runs and the loss of six wickets to 112 runs with the loss of all 10 wickets.\nThanks to an agreement with the Indian Premier League (IPL), several of the American teams share IPL mascots. Chenai and Texas are the Super Kings, Mumbai and New York are the Indians, Kolkata and Los Angeles are the Knight Riders. All six teams — Texas, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. — began this week’s tournament in Texas, to be continued in North Carolina, and then return to Texas for the playoffs on July 27.\nThe scene in Grand Prairie\nMajor League Cricket debuted to a sellout crowd of around 7,000 fans with the kind of diversity the NFL, the NBA, and MLB can only dream about. Television networks from around the world, including America’s Willow cable channel, broadcast the game live to hundreds of millions in cricket-mad places like India, Australia and New Zealand, the U.K., and South Africa. International news outlets have run coverage almost hourly through the weekend.\nMLC took over an abandoned independent league baseball stadium (the Airhogs) in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, and invested heavily in a world class cricket oval. There, fans in Dallas Cowboys gear and Bass Pro Shop hats mixed with the national team jerseys from every cricket nation. Country and Western, Bollywood, and hip-hop blasted overhead. Fans munched on chickpeas and rice seasoned with Tex-Mex Chipotle hot sauce. The Dallas metroplex made for a surprising backdrop. Looming over the new cricket stadium is Lone Star Park, a hulking horse racing venue. Soaring above the racetrack’s spire, commercial jets take off and land from nearby DFW Airport.\nInside the arena, an English gentleman from Birmingham, more recently residing in Jacksonville, stayed over in Dallas when he learned he could catch the first-ever Major League Cricket game. Tim Miller, 54, and his son Iain, 18, live locally in the Dallas metroplex and were standing near the field an hour before the action began. Iain began playing with friends, mostly Indian, in a nearby park as the pandemic began. He fell in love with the game and has now tried out for an Under-19 team. He and his father watch cricket on Willow. Mark Roberts and his kids, 10 and 13, drove 12 hours from Fort Collins, Colo., to see the launch. Dad took an interest in 2018 when he stumbled across the sport on Willow. He wanted to introduce his kids to cricket because “it’s a better alternative to baseball.” Why? The action. Like a winter league baseball game in the Caribbean, fans blew whistles and anticipated, and then reacted to, every play of the game.\nBy all accounts, the cricket grounds and the quality of play were top-notch. Likewise, the league clearly invested in slick, professional video and merchandise. Cricket in the Pacific Northwest Orcas cricket is backed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Madrona Venture Group Managing Director S. Soma Somasegar; Icertis co-founder and CEO Samir Bodas; GreatPoint Ventures managing partner Ashok Krishnamurthi; and former Microsoft and Avalara executive Sanjay Parthasarathy. \nSoma and his family attended both Orcas games over the weekend. “Seattle was initially not a day 1 city for the league,” he said. “But because of the strong and vibrant fan base and sports community in Seattle we made Seattle a day 1 city for the league. We have an important fan base to build upon.” He pointed out that the U.S. and Seattle should be part of the world’s second most popular sport. “Sports bring people from different perspectives together” he said. “ We want to unify.” Tech hubs like Seattle and Silicon Valley in California have long attracted software programmers from India. The Asian Indian population in the U.S. has grown steadily, rising from 2 million in 2000 to more than 5 million. In the Seattle area, Microsoft is incorporating a recreational cricket pitch on its new campus in Redmond. King County’s Marymoor Park, where Seattle’s amateur league has played for decades, envisions its own professionally-run stadium.\nWhat’s next for MLC?\nSeattle will play three more matches in Morristown, N.C., over the weekend. The teams return to Texas for the championship round. Beyond that, it’s a little uncertain. MLC franchises expect to have their grounds in order by the 2025 season. Tom Dunmore, who heads MLC marketing, said the hope is that 2025 will be the first regular season.\nNext year, the U.S. and the West Indies (Jamaica, Bahamas, Antigua) will co-host cricket’s World Cup. The International Cricket Committee (ICC), the equivalent of soccer’s FIFA, is currently working to identify host cities. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland are possibilities. With the Oakland Athletics heading to Las Vegas, that could open up a suitable stadium. The Oakland Coliseum is known for its generous foul territory, which would enable a proper cricket oval. Dunmore says MLC will wait to see what the ICC comes up with, and perhaps next year’s MLC tournament could be played on a World Cup pitch. “Not to be cliché, but if you build it people will come,” Dunmore said.\nRead the rest of the post on Geekwire.\nPublishing partner of founders, innovators, poets, thinkers, and tinkerers.\nSeattle | Washington, D.C.\nAbout Us\nWriting Collaborations\nMeet the Team\nContact Us\nImprints\nClyde Hill\nPulley Press﻿\nShare your email below to receieve updates, news, and behind the scenes info.\n\nThank you for signing up!

  "body": "Did you know that cricket is the second most popular sport in the world? Second only to football (aka soccer), this sport with roots in 17th-century England has more than a billion fans worldwide and is especially popular in India and Pakistan.\nMany Americans aren’t familiar with the sport – but Major League Cricket is on a mission to change that. Although pro teams have played around the world for most of this century, professional major league cricket made its American debut this month with six teams – including plenty of international stars – playing a championship series in stadiums near Dallas, Texas, and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.\nA post shared by Major League Cricket (@mlcricketusa)\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce America’s national pastime – before baseball took over in the late 1800s – cricket may already be more popular on our shores than people realize, especially in Texas. Tickets sold out for most of the matches in the competition, including the final game on July 30 in Grand Prairie, Texas – and there are multiple amateur cricket pitches (fields) around the country, the largest of which is the Prairie View Cricket Complex, a 90-acre, 10-field facility northwest of Houston that has partnered with the nascent pro league to create the first MLC National Cricket Center.\nOn the MLC website, league co-founder Sameer Mehta says, “The passion fans have shown for Major League Cricket in Texas has demonstrated the bright future the game has in the United States … and this is only the start of a fantastic new era for American cricket.”\nNaturally, that new era calls for licensed fan merchandise, and the league’s online shop offers jerseys, T-shirts and caps for four of the six teams, with links to two more team shops on separate sites. Optamark Graphics (PPAI 714796, D3), a Connecticut-based distributor, has partnered with MLC to develop a full promo program that includes uniforms and fan apparel for the four teams selling on its site, as well as gameday giveaways for the league.\nFor example, fans attending the first match – in triple-digit heat – received a yellow promo flag for the home team, the Texas Super Kings, who won the match and signed the flags for eager fans.\nA post shared by Major League Cricket (@mlcricketusa)\n\n\n\nTarang Gosalia, CEO of Optamark and a self-described “passionate fan” of the sport, sees huge growth potential for cricket and says he’s excited to help the league and teams build their brands.\n“There seems to be a real fandom behind the sport, and we’re excited that we have this kind of deal in place with Major League Cricket now, not just now but for next season as well,” he says.\nIt was important to understand the larger context of the sport in order to develop the initial uniforms and promo offerings, Gosalia adds. The U.S. teams are representative of beloved India Premier League teams, which have huge online fan bases worldwide. The Texas Super Kings are affiliated with the Chennai Super Kings, for example, and their gear needed to reflect that connection.\n“They have their own brand standards, their own brand guidelines, their PMS colors from Pantone,” Gosalia says. “We worked with the creative teams at each individual sports franchise. We conceptualized what their current design aesthetic was, and then we created the concept design for the U.S. teams.”\nFour essential apparel pieces – jerseys, tees and hats – were selected and produced for the initial fan merch collection using the new team branding elements.\n\nOptamark also created bucket hats given to fans attending the games. Those hats and the flags have proved so popular that they will be added to the merch collections online, Gosalia says. He notes strong demand for apparel in children’s sizes, as well.\nA post shared by Major League Cricket (@mlcricketusa)\n\n\n\nOnline traffic and sales for the initial collection have been “tremendous,” Gosalia says, and a great deal stronger than expected. Texas Super Kings gear sold out halfway through the tournament, prompting a quick reorder for the playoffs, and Optamark will use data collected from the online shop, as well as what they’ve learned from in-person sales at the games, to adjust inventory and expand the product offerings.\n“We think there’s a lot of opportunity to build on this,” says Gosalia, “because they’re looking to expand with more and more teams within the league as this league continues to grow – and it’s only season No. 1.”\nPromotional Products  Association International\n3125 Skyway Circle North  Irving, TX 75038  888-I-AM-PPAI (426-7724)  Mon-Fri: 8:30 am to 5:00 pm CST webmaster@ppai.org\n\n                            Go to PPAI.org\n                        \nPPAI © Promotional Products Association International 2022.

  "body": "“Deep in the Heart of Texas”, a popular song about Texas, blared from the speakers during a timeout a few days into the debut of a US professional cricket league near Dallas.\nFans waved the flags of the Texas Super Kings and the LA Knight Riders, with some wearing the jerseys of their favorite countries or clubs overseas. A couple had ballcaps of two of the biggest brands in the United States – the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys and Major League Baseball’s New York Yankees.\nMajor League Cricket’s debut\nThis unusual confluence comes during the debut of Major League Cricket, which is hoping to find a foothold for one of the world’s most popular sports in a sports-mad country that knows little about the other bat-and-ball game.\nBecause of a willing partner happy to see a fading minor league baseball stadium turned into one of the few legitimate cricket pitches in the country, the league made its start in Texas, famous for the Friday night lights of high school football. The 7,000-seat stadium is in Grand Prairie, not far from where the Dallas Cowboys football team play in front of 90,000-plus fans eight or nine times every fall under a retractable roof with a giant video board hanging over the field.\nAlso read: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023: Schedule, squads, format, live TV, streaming, match times in IST\n“Some days I think we’re crazy,” tournament director Justin Geale said. “We’re in the middle of Dallas and we’ve got a cricket ground. I saw the vision. I got very excited. I got goose bumps when I first came in here. I thought, We can do this.”\n3 IPL owners in the fray\nAs with many things, money is the key, and co-founder Sameer Mehta said investors behind the initial $120 million aren’t expecting to turn a profit for several years, if then. Much of the money is coming from India, where arguably the best T20 cricket, the three-hour version that most closely resembles baseball, is played in the Indian Premier League. Three IPL owners are helping run US teams.\nWith a salary cap that’s competitive with similar T20 tournaments around the world, Major League Cricket organisers secured most of the better-known players they pursued, including Texas Super Kings captain Faf du Plessis.\nThe South African was swarmed by autograph seekers during a match against Washington when his playing time was finished. There are US players as well on rosters that allow six spots for international veterans. Mehta said he had no concerns about the quality of play even without IPL players because of rules preventing them from being in the US.\nAlso read: Major League Cricket (MLC): Fleming to be Texas Super Kings coach\n“There’s some bloody good players out there, especially with the IPL owning some of the franchises here, they bring across some international players,” said Australia’s Matthew Short, the player of the match for Washington in a victory over Texas. “As the tournament gets on the next couple of years, I think it’s important we get those players here and really bring up the local guys here as well.”\nPriyank Shah, a native of India who has been working and studying in the US for six years, shouted toward the players he recognised as they walked to and from the locker room. There were plenty of them.\n“Besides Indian players, the other players who are playing here, they are like rock stars,” said Shah, who lives in the Dallas area, the metropolitan region that is seeing explosive growth in its Asian population.\nThe first eight matches in the six-team tournament were in Texas, with seven more set for Morrisville, North Carolina. The event returns to the Dallas area for elimination games, with the championship match on July 30.\nFor now, the league’s six cities, Washington, Seattle, New York, and San Francisco included, are merely represented by the players. The goal is a home-and-home league, with 30 matches per team spanning roughly two months, but that’s several years off. Mehta said the clubs are contractually obligated to open venues within five years.\nThe 2024 plan calls for another tournament format, perhaps with two more venues. And organisers hope to build off the T20 World Cup, which will be held in part in the US for the first time.\nFive-year growth program\nGeale is hopeful cricket will be added as an Olympic sport for 2028, when the Games are in Los Angeles.\n“All of a sudden, we’ve got this five-year growth program for the sport,” Geale said. “A big part of what we’re trying to do is strengthen the USA national team.”\nAnother part of the growth plan is more grass roots, which Mehta said will take time. Youth and recreational leagues will be crucial to the US becoming more competitive internationally.\nAnd while Houston has a strong-enough presence in cricket to have hosted training camps leading to the Major League Cricket debut, the league will need similar facilities in the six cities with teams.\nCricket in the US has to fight against heavy odds\n“The odds are stacked against us,” Geale said. “We’re trying to launch a new sport in a country that doesn’t know it needs it. I think we need to be realistic. But I think if we can showcase how cool we think the game is, if we can put out a really good TV product, we can get that to people in America and the world to show this is going to work.”\nThere are plenty of examples of how Geale and Mehta want to Americanise the sport. One of the best is the ball going into the stands for the cricket version of a home run – all of them are homers since the game is played over all 360 degrees of a circular field.\n“Baseball fans are used to keeping those balls. Cricket fans are conditioned to throw them back because the sanctity of play is that the same ball has to be used unless of course (it’s) out of shape,” Mehta said.\nAlso read: Ahead of IPL 2023, CSK eyeing stake in Major League Cricket’s Texas team\nOne day, Geale would love for fans to keep the balls. For now, he was worried about that for the debut but didn’t need to be. Fans promptly tossed the balls back, which made sense considering what Mehta said about marketing. The target for the debut was ex-patriots of countries in South Asia and the Caribbean, along with Australia and New Zealand.\nThat’s another part of the short-term plan.\n“What I would love to do is for these fans to quickly bring their friends, family, associates, colleagues along to a game and have them sample this,” Mehta said. “But it’s OK if it takes another year. And by next year, we’ll be doing a lot of general marketing, trying to reach out to mainstream American sports fans.”\nThere were a few of those fans in the tournament’s first few days, including Dan Strick. The Dallas-area resident who got hooked on cricket through TV about a year ago brought his son to see a match.\n“Based on a year and a half of experience, I’ve only watched the best teams in the world play,” Strick said. “So obviously this might be a little poorer. But it’s still fun.”\n(With inputs from agencies)"

The Super Kings won by 69 runs after making 181 for six and then bowling out the Los Angeles Knight Riders for 112.\nThe first ever #MajorLeagueCricket game has come to a close. @TexasSuperKings dominate, winning by a whopping 69 runs. 🏏 🦁 pic.twitter.com/0zI0DUoPCc\nAny concerns that cricket in America might not be the real deal vanished when the action got underway and the crowd began cheering the big-hitting of the home team. The stadium previously belonged to the now defunct Texas Airhogs minor league baseball club, but since taking over the venue, MLC has spent over $20 million making it cricket-specific. For viewers watching the TV broadcast, it would have been hard to tell the difference between MLC and the other T20 tournaments that have sprung up around the world.\nAlso Read: PM Narendra Modi lauds 'Superhit' French striker Kylian Mbappe, says he's more popular in India than in France\nWith international players competing alongside domestic talent from the USA national team, the standard of play was clearly professional and the field and wicket looked up to scratch. That was in marked contrast to many previous, short-lived attempts to \"break the American market\" with one-off events in unsuitable venues, and was also light years away from much of the domestic cricket, which for years was played on matting tracks.\nTexas' South African bowler Rusty Theron was taken aback by the success of the opening game.\n\"I am actually a little bit emotional, to be honest. This is such a grand event. There was an unbelievable atmosphere and I want to thank each and every individual who has come out here,\" he said.\nSuper Kings batsman David Miller, who was awarded Player of the Match, for his hard-hitting 61 from 42 balls, including four sixes, was also impressed.\n\"It's fantastic to see such a great turn out and the facilities have been fantastic. I think there have been a few guys, kind of questioned around what it was going to be like but it shot the lights out here,\" said the South African, one of several players with a background in the world's top Twenty20 competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nMLC has backing from four IPL franchises including the Mumbai Indians, whose New York team began play on Friday. England opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams. Other games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom. The league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE\n\nYou can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community.

  "body": "\nAnother year and it’s another title for the Mumbai Indians franchise, but this time in the USA’s Major League Cricket. This is the second title for the MI family in the year 2023, as MI Women’s team also won the inaugural WPL trophy. \nMajor League Cricket is a great initiative to promote the sport in the biggest sports market i.e., the United States of America. After the Minor League Cricket, which was the foundation of the Major League Cricket, MLC was successfully launched on the 14th of July 2023, with six teams participating in the inaugural season. \nOut of the six teams, three had parent franchises in the Indian Premier League. Texas Super Kings is owned by the Super Kings family, MI New York from the Mumbai Indians family and LA Knight Riders is owned by the Knight Riders group. The other three teams were; Washington Freedom, Seattle Orcas, and San Francisco Unicorns. \nFaf Du Plessis led Texas, Kieron Pollard captained the MI New York, Aaron Finch led the San Francisco Unicorns, Sunil Narine led the LA Knight Riders, Wayne Parnell was leading the Seatle Orcas, and Moises Henriques led the Washington Freedom Team.\nWinners of the inaugural Major League Cricket\nMI New York, led by Kieron Pollard, were nowhere near the playoffs after losing two of their first three games. It was the last game of the league stage that changed the fortunes of the team. \nWell, one can say that Nicholas Pooran changed the fortunes of the team. He was just impeccable throughout the tournament. His golden run continued in MLC as well. Sadly, his team won’t be featuring in the upcoming World Cup despite his exceptional performances. \nIt was a tough road for MINY to get to the final when they struggled to make it to the playoffs. But MI did what MI does, and we saw a whole different team in the knockout stage. Dewald Brevis and Tim David were no less as Brevis helped MI New York perform well in the Playoffs. And then Nicky Phammered the Seattle Orcas in the Final with his knock of 137 runs off just 55 deliveries. \nPooran became the highest scorer of the tournament, with 388 runs in just eight innings averaging nearly 65. And Trent Boult, who was also a part of this team, became the highest wicket-taker of the season with 22 wickets in just eight innings. \nApart from these guys, MINY also had Rashid Khan, David Wiese, Kagiso Rabada and a few local players. Despite this much strength and experience in the team, MINY suffered earlier in the tournament but eventually had a fairytale ending with the Caribbean brothers adding one more trophy to the MI cabinet. \nThe success of the MLC 2023\nThe inaugural season of the Major League Cricket was a successful stint as players from all over the world took part. Players like Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Dwayne Bravo, Devon Conway and many more were a part of this new and delightful league.\nEven Glenn Maxwell believes that MLC will attract the cricketers more as they will get to travel to the USA once a year.\nFor the local players, like Cameron Gannon, who was named the domestic player of the tournament, it was a great opportunity to have international players in their dressing room with highly experienced support staff. \nMajor League Cricket will not just take the US cricket forward but also help them grow and get recognition at the international level, and it will be no surprise if we see the USA cricket team in the next World Cup.\n\nnote– image sourced from Major League Cricket Twitter handle\n Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n \n\n\n\nCricket is a game played by 22 but opined by millions.\nI care to submit, I too am an opinion maker.\nQuite early in life, I decided not to snort drugs, and focus on Cricket instead.\nIt’s now, after seeing the Lara’s and Kallis’ walk into the sunset and having witnessed nothing new in Gayle’s dances moves that I decided to put a context to my words. It’s great that the likes of Afghanistan are finding their feat today, as Cricket is finding a global foothold.\nIn these pages you can expect to find a mix of musings, tributes and lamentation on contemporary and yesterday’s action and stars.\nCaught At Point will try to inform you and humour you on the game’s newsmakers, trends and, emerging patterns. Expect those deserving praise to be celebrated and expect tons of ‘arsehattery’ gifted to those who’ve earned it.\nI’ll cricket sincerely,\nDev Tyagi"

  "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) finally got underway in the United States last week after several false starts, fuelling hopes that the sport is poised to break new ground in a huge new market on the back of the popular Twenty20 format.\nFive years after USA Cricket shared its plans to launch a domestic T20 tournament, the inaugural edition of the MLC kicked off having assembled an impressive array of investors. Four of its six franchises are owned by business entities which also own teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the money-spinning standard bearer of franchise cricket.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is co-owner of the MLC's Seattle franchise, while Washington and San Francisco franchises have strategic partnerships with the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria. While franchise-based competitions are springing up all around the world, Tom Dunmore, MLC's marketing vice president, said the U.S. competition cannot be dismissed as \"just another T20 league\".\n\"We're building stadiums and youth academies, we're building training centres and bringing in coaches and players,\" he told Reuters from Dallas. \"Those will be available for the USA national teams as well.\n\"It's not really like other T20 leagues that are using existing facilities in cricket-mad countries.\" While cricket remains a niche sport in the U.S. it has been around for a long time in the country - the first international cricket match took place in New York in 1844 with the United States taking on Canada.\nThe MLC could be cricket's vehicle to break into a sporting landscape dominated by baseball, basketball and American football, said Dunmore. \"We're cracking a new market for the sport,\" he added.\n\"Cricket hasn't really broken into a major new market for some time. So this is a chance not only to do that, but to do it in the world's biggest commercial market.\" Dunmore said cricket's existing fan base in the U.S. made it the sport's fifth-largest market.\n\"If we slice off even a small percentage of the rest of the population, you've got a massive market.\" West Indies' Kieron Pollard, one of the first players to fully embrace franchise cricket, was confident MLC would take cricket \"prime-time\" in the U.S., even though others had failed to break open the market.\n\"Obviously before MLC, different people have tried different things,\" the 36-year-old, who leads the league's New York franchise, told Reuters. \"But now the difference is the backing of the Indian franchises and the international players that are coming.\"\n'THE BUZZ' Success on the global stage would help boost cricket's profile in the United States, and while there has been no big breakthrough as yet Pollard said they are getting closer.\nA U.S. team featuring players mostly of Indian origin made it to the 50-overs World Cup qualifiers in June but failed to make the cut for the main tournament in India later this year. But the experience of rubbing shoulders with the likes of former South Africa captain Faf du Plessis and England international Jason Roy would stand them in good stead, Pollard said.\n\"It augurs well for USA cricket, and hopefully the young talent that is there in America can use this opportunity to grow into better international cricketers,\" he added. Co-hosting the T20 World Cup next year with West Indies will also give the game a boost in the United States.\nThe launch of the MLC assumes even more importance coming at a time when the International Cricket Council (ICC) is lobbying for the game's Olympic inclusion at the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Dunmore said the MLC was providing cricket much-needed visibility as the game bids to return to the Olympics for the first time since 1900.\n\"The crowds and the excitement, the buzz, the media attention both in the US and globally, now that's truly helpful,\" he added. ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice acknowledged the buzz MLC has created in the United States.\n\"There are a number of developments in the U.S. that are helping to raise awareness of the game, the start of the MLC is one of them, they draw a lot of attention to the sport,\" Allardice said last week.\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\n Email: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15 \n© Copyright 2023"

  "body": "With the United States' foray into T20 franchise cricket set to take off in July, some of the sport's most influential figures in Australia have been calling the shots\nGraham Manou certainly didn't think in cricket he'd ever find himself at NASA.\nYet the one-Test wicketkeeper, now Cricket Victoria high performance manager, was there at the Space Centre in Houston calling the shots prior to launch in March.\nIt was draft night in Texas for Major League Cricket's inaugural season – the United States' foray into T20 franchise cricket – and some of Australian cricket's most influential figures were right in the thick of it.\nA few days earlier, MLC tournament director Justin Geale – who was born in Canberra and grew up in Wagga Wagga, and later spent eight years in cricket operations at the Indian Premier League – was sat next to Manou, CV chief executive Nick Cummins, Victorian assistant coach Ben Rohrer and Cricket NSW Head of Male Cricket Michael Klinger watching America's best domestic talent at a 13-day draft combine.\nAmong them was Victorian and Melbourne Stars fast bowler Brody Couch, one of four 'Australian-American' prospects up for grabs in the draft.\n\"It was quite surreal,\" Geale recalls, \"we're sitting in Houston in the middle of nowhere at these six turf cricket fields just thinking 'we could be anywhere in the world, but we're all together, Australians here in Houston'.\n\"It's been a learning curve for them as well, a steep one when you come from somewhere like the Big Bash, which is now well established, really well run, well organised, promoted and defined, to something a bit new and unknown like this.\"\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\nAfter South Africa (SA20) and the United Arab Emirates (International League T20), the US is set to become the third nation to launch a new domestic T20 league in 2023.\nGeale agrees \"there is too much cricket at the moment\", but he also believes the US has a significant advantage.\n\"We've got that clear window,\" he tells cricket.com.au from his home just outside of Chicago.\n\"Around that Christmas time this year you had Big Bash, then there was the SA20, there was the UAE T20 going on, Nepal, Bangladesh, all these ones at the same times competing with the same players.\n\"Our summer here, we can play cricket a lot of the year round depending where in the country you are … down in Florida or LA you've got a longer season.\n\"Fundamentally, our summer is the opposite to a southern hemisphere summer so really it's the UK that we're going alongside.\n\"That window helps, we can generally get some of the best players in the world for two or three weeks to come over and play some really good cricket.\"\nStarting on July 13, the six MLC teams will play 19 games in 18 days mostly at Grand Prairie Stadium – a former baseball park that's been converted into the league's new 7200-seat purpose-built home near Dallas.\nIt's already attracting plenty of global superstars too, including Aaron Finch and Marcus Stoinis (San Francisco Unicorns), Mitch Marsh and Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas), and Anrich Nortje and Wanindu Hasaranga (Washington Freedom).\n\"As a kid growing up, we're pretty heavily influenced by American sport and culture, so I think there's a degree of curiosity about cricket in this market and the players are no different to us,\" Geale says.\n\"They're quite keen to come and see and do something new.\"\nAnother advantage according to Geale is the scale of commercial opportunity with sponsors and broadcasting in the US sports market.\nAnd while there have been previous attempts to establish a cricket competition in the USA – such as Pro Cricket in 2004 – this iteration has the backing of more than a dozen of America's most successful business leaders, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe chairman and CEO Shantanu Narayen.\nThree IPL franchises have also bought in – Los Angeles Knight Riders (Kolkata), MI New York (Mumbai Indians) and Texas Super Kings (Chennai), while GMR Group, the co-owner of the Delhi Capitals, have partnered with the Seattle Orcas.\n\"The level of investment we have, being privately funded out of Silicon Valley, you've got some pretty high-net-worth individuals … that are personally invested in this,\" Geale says.\n\"We'll be able to drive a really competitive salary cap and we're there from day one.\"\nWhy are Victoria and NSW involved?\nUnlike the four IPL teams who have extensive experience running a cricket program, the lead investors of the San Francisco and Washington franchises don't.\nUnicorns pair Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan are the founding partners at Milliways Ventures and Rocketship.vc, while Freedom's lead investor Sanjay Govil is the founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions and CEO of Zyter.\nBoth franchises were therefore looking to partner with an existing professional organisation to run their respective cricket departments and help with the recruitment of players and coaches, establish training, sports science and sports medicine programs, and facilitate match day operations.\nThat's where Cricket Victoria and Cricket NSW come in – with more than 130 years of delivering cricket in their respective states, they are San Francisco and Washington's high performance partners.\nIt's how Manou and Klinger found themselves at NASA on March 19 trying to build a roster for their respective teams having only laid eyes on most of the domestic talent over the preceding two weeks at the draft combine.\n\"The interesting part for us was that you felt at times perhaps we're going in very blind here,\" Manou tells cricket.com.au after returning to Melbourne. \"But heading across and seeing them play and being around the combine was certainly worth us going and doing that.\n\"We felt quite lucky in the way we thought the draft would play out in terms of what players would and wouldn't be available at different times was right, which probably suggests there was some clear bands in terms of the talent.\"\nKlinger adds: \"We did a lot of research before heading over with our analysts … (but) the four days of two matches each day (at the combine) definitely opened our eyes a little bit more.\"\nWhat's in it for the two states?\nIt's a fair question – how does partnering with a US-based franchise help with the success of NSW in the Marsh Sheffield Shield or the two Sydney clubs in the KFC BBL?\nBeyond the obvious links it establishes for players to be picked up by their state's MLC club, Geale believes most sporting organisations in Australia realise that a lot of the growth opportunities are offshore.\n\"It's another way for them to expand their footprint in a global cricket world, which is changing rapidly all the time,\" he says.\nAlong with establishing links for players, there will also be opportunities for coaches, physiotherapists, team operations staff and analysts from Victoria and NSW to get experience in a new environment.\n\"The cricket landscape is changing very quickly so to be directly involved in the way cricket's moving and part of the landscape that's T20 franchise cricket … it was obviously a very attractive tournament to be involved in,\" Klinger says.\nBut both states also understand their first obligation is ensuring their Australian players and squads are being serviced well.\n\"In the first year, we'll make it a relatively skeleton staff,\" Manou says.\n\"We've got some high-quality senior players in (former England fast bowler) Liam Plunkett and Corey Anderson (ex-New Zealand) who will no doubt play more than just playing role, both are equally as good as any leader that I've come across and have both shown a lot of interest in developing as coaches and getting involved in off field management as well.\"\nFor Geale and the sport in the US, the partnership goes beyond just Major League Cricket (which received official sanctioning from the governing body, USA Cricket, last month).\n\"Importantly, it opens up opportunities … I really think some of our younger players could benefit from six or eight weeks or a season in grade cricket, that's really going to elevate their cricket being around better cricketers,\" he says.\n\"That's one of the appeals for us with the Australian market and the season works nicely for that.\n\"The same as coaching staff, the same if you look beyond that at curators, at event operations staff, so that summer works nicely, a lot of six or seven-month jobs there, they can come over here for a few months.\"\nKlinger revealed NSW would also explore having a coach based in Washington or the US to work with their players weekly, while Manou says the Australian pathway system would also benefit from the relationship with potential opportunities for Premier cricketers to play in minor league teams.\n\"It might be playing a Premier Cricket season, it might be getting involved with one of our two BBL teams and training with them for a few weeks and being part of a really good set-up with two very experienced coaches in Greg Shipperd (Sydney Sixers) and Trevor Bayliss (Sydney Thunder), we're certainly looking at ways we can help those individuals become better cricketers, but also help cricket in America overall,\" Klinger says.\nThere are 'Australian-American' players?\nCameron Stevenson says he's never been one to get \"super nervous\" but as he sat in his office in Melbourne about midday on Monday, March 20 watching Geale announce each pick, he couldn't look and had to step away from his computer.\nHalf a world away at NASA, the United States' best players were up for grabs and Stevenson – by virtue of his mum's heritage – was one of the top prospects.\nAn engineer by day whose firm SPORTENG has been helping the MLC develop their new Grand Prairie Stadium, the 30-year-old says being part of the inaugural draft had the \"heart pounding\".\n\"I was too nervous to look once we started getting into the later rounds that I might not go, and I actually stepped away from my computer,\" Stevenson, who was part of Tasmania's list until 2018, recalls to cricket.com.au.\nBrody Couch – whose mum was also born in the US – was another watching along on YouTube from back home in Victoria, having just returned from the draft combine in Texas.\nFinally, in the sixth round, Geale read out Stevenson's name – pick 31 to the Texas Super Kings – and two picks later the Australian-American tournament director was back at the lectern announcing Couch's selection by the San Francisco Unicorns.\nThe most experienced Aussie 'local' Cameron Gannon – who like the other two qualifies as a US domestic player due to his mum – had been picked up two rounds earlier by the Seattle Orcas, where he has been joined current West Australian teammate Mitch Marsh as an overseas recruit, though Marsh's availability for the tournament is now under threat due to his inclusion in Australia's Ashes squad.\nFormer Victorian and current Hampshire allrounder Ian Holland – who was born in the midwestern US state of Wisconsin – was the other 'Australian-American' in the draft pool, but he missed out on selection.\n\"It was a bit of relief in the end just to know that I'm going to be part of it all in the inaugural season,\" Couch says.\n\"I was definitely nervous at the time because I was hoping to go a bit sooner than I did but, when I heard my named called, I was just relieved.\"\nCouch – whose mum grew up on a dairy farm at Albany in upstate New York where her family still reside – had been at the combine from March 4-16, which he says helped him determine where he thought his ability was compared to the other local players.\n\"It was all completely new,\" the 23-year-old recalls, \"I had a roommate (Matthew Tromp, pick 49 to Seattle Orcas) who I'd never met before.\n\"It was a lot less structured and there was a big onus on myself just to put in what I wanted to get out of having that time over there.\n\"It was quite refreshing for me actually … being one of the very few Aussies over there at the time that I went, I put myself out of my comfort zone a little bit and built some connections with people who I probably never thought I would.\n\"The guys were really welcoming and just love their cricket … so it was no different to back here in that sense.\"\nWhat's the depth of American talent like?\n\"There's a lot more cricket in the US already than people realise,\" says Stevenson, who has played 18 ODIs and four T20Is for the USA owing to his mum being born Arizona and raised in California.\n\"There's definitely room for cricket over there and enough interest to build cricket in the US into something that's a little bit more mainstream than what it is now.\n\"These guys are as good as I've seen in terms of raw talent. The ability that they've got is up there with any state cricketer that I've seen here.\n\"It's a really difficult environment to flourish as a cricketer because of the lack of first-class facilities and the level of competition historically hasn't been there to help these guys hone their game at a really high level.\"\nBoth Manou and Klinger admit they were \"pleasantly surprised\" at the skills on display from the local US players at the draft combine.\nThe fact that Gannon was drafted in the fourth round, and Couch and Stevenson – all who have played first-class cricket and in the Big Bash, with Stevenson also featuring for the US national team as recently as last September – were taken in the sixth round, attests to this.\nOnly eight of the 48 non-rookie players drafted to MLC teams haven't played first-class cricket and not even being a reigning ODI World Cup champion was enough to get Plunkett picked in the first round.\nAnd former New Zealand allrounder Anderson, former Indian under-19 captain Unmukt Chand, Plunkett, No.1 MLC draft pick Harmeet Singh and former Punjab leg-spinner Sarabjit Ladda all have IPL experience.\n\"The depth of talent is there, there's no doubt about that,\" Klinger says.\n\"There's a lot of ex-players from the subcontinent who've played international cricket or been part of IPL franchises or PSL (Pakistan Super League) franchises. There were players who had been in first-class systems in the subcontinent, first-class systems in South Africa, who left for different reasons.\n\"So there was definitely a positive feel about the quality that was there and that they'd be able to match it against some of our high quality overseas players as well.\"\nManou adds: \"There was certainly a band of players that could play and have played first-class cricket and there was quite a significant band of players that would easily fit into Premier first-grade across (Australia).\n\"It is and has been a bit of a sleeping giant there for a while. And hopefully this is the catalyst to make it grow.\"\nWith at least five players in each team's starting XI required to be domestic players, which is more than the two required in fellow associate nation the UAE's ILT20 tournament, that depth will be needed to ensure the quality of the product in its first season remains high.\nWith a maximum of six overseas recruits allowed in the XI and nine in the squad, along with 10 domestic players on the roster, each franchise was also required to pick a rookie from the under-23 age group in the ninth round of the draft.\n\"When I first got to America, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good the cricket was here, there's literally thousands of leagues played across the country,\" Geale says.\n\"What I was probably most disappointed or shocked at was the infrastructure and where we play. A lot of it is soccer fields, baseball diamonds, which aren't perfect, it's guys diving around with no faith in the outfield or councils that couldn't cut the grass any lower because baseball is 'this' height.\n\"It's taken three years to try and build a domestic program working with USA Cricket, working with the local leagues to try and build a pathway to the national team and to really give our domestic players the best chance.\n\"So when the major league comes around, it's got to be about the cricket, the cricket has got to be a good product.\n\"We can bring 'Finchy' and all the boys across but if the domestic players aren't up for it, it won't work. We're really confident that we've spent these three years building up our domestic programs, so the strength of the game from day one is going to be really good.\""

  "body": "Twenty-two men will paint North Texas purple, gold and yellow Thursday for a game of bat and ball during the historic debut of Major League Cricket. The sport is wildly popular in many places, but not in the United States.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings will host the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the opening match of a 19-match tournament at the newly transformed 7,200-seat Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas.\n\n\"It's a new beginning for cricket in this country,\" said Zubin Surkari, who is managing operations for Major League Cricket. \"T20 (a shorter format) is an exciting three hours of cricket, the pitch looks great, the field looks great. This has never been done in terms of a stadium of this magnitude.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMLC is a six-team competition that will be played from July 13-30 across two venues.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium in Texas will host the first eight games while the next seven matches will take place in Church Street Park in Morrisville, N.C., near Raleigh and Durham. The teams will then move back to Grand Prairie to participate in the playoffs.\n\nMI New York, the San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom are the remaining four teams, all featuring plenty of international cricket stars.\n\nMLC is a $120 million investment from multiple entities — mainly Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders of Willow TV, the largest broadcaster of cricket in North America.\n\nThe two businessmen plan to grow the game in the United States by bringing in international talent, and building stadiums and training facilities in hopes of cultivating the new generation of U.S. cricketers.\n\n\n\nDespite being the world's second most-watched sport, behind soccer, cricket never managed to gain popularity in the U.S.\n\nSurkari said the new league's backers would like to change that and are marketing MLC to any American who likes bat-and-ball sport.\n\n\"The T20 format of cricket is very palatable to most people,\" Surkari said. \"Three hours of fun, getting ready for the stadium which has concession stands and lights and things for kids to do. It is like any other Minor League, Major League Baseball, but not just on that grand scale yet.\"\n\nHowever, Peter Della Penna, a former ESPN cricket writer, said the MLC has failed to cater to the sporting culture of the U.S. and has not done much to cultivate organic support from the general American public.\n\n\"A lot of the tickets have been given away as gifts to the families of the cricket players and organizers to fill in the stadium for the opening night,\" he said. \"There has been little to no effort made in terms of initiating grassroot level effort.\"\n\nPenna has been covering cricket in the U.S. for the past 18 years. He said that MLC's approach of developing cricket in the country is not different from that of USA Cricket (the men's and women's national cricket teams), as both have depended largely on migration patterns instead of building an organic pathway like other sports.\n\n\"There are a lot of people immigrating to participate in MLC but what does that say about the health and sustainability of the league and cricket more broadly in the country,\" Penna said. \"Instead of bringing in international stars that no Americans know about, cricket should rather be introduced as a high school league first which will create a pathway for it to be a NCAA Division 1 scholarship sport.\" \n\n Copyright 2023 NPR.

Cricket is similar to baseball in that it’s a bat-and-ball game played between two teams. Teams can score runs by hitting the ball thrown by a player on the opposing team, across the boundary. \nIf you need a better explainer (because we did) — watch this video.\nThe style of cricket that will be played is called Twenty20 — one of the three current forms of cricket recognized as the highest international level by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nLet’s give a Texas-sized welcome to the Super Kings and Major League Cricket. \nPhoto courtesy of MLC\n\nA total of 19 matches will take place over two weeks with 11 played in Grand Prairie and eight played in North Carolina. \nSix teams — from Texas, Seattle, Los Angeles, Washington, New York, and San Francisco — will compete in a 15-match, round-robin group stage, with the top four teams advancing to the playoffs to determine the ultimate champion.\nThe MLC Championship Finals will be played at Grand Prairie Stadium on Sunday, July 30.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings will call the stadium at 1600 Lone Star Pkwy. home. The venue was initially used by the Texas AirHogs — a minor league baseball team — between 2008-2020. \nTickets are going quickly with a high chance of sellouts for future games.

(AP Photo Surjeet Yadav, File) \nWELLINGTON, New Zealand - George Bernard Shaw asserted “the English are not very spiritual people so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.”\nIt has been a long game, traditionally.\n\nWhile cricket has flourished in England and some of its former colonies, it has never taken off to the same degree in the United States, where some have perceived it as impenetrable.\nA sport played in its purist form by players in long white uniforms, test cricket goes on for five days and still often ends with no winner, with days so long players twice have to leave the field for meals.\nMajor League Cricket, which begins on Thursday, could change that perception. For a start, the games only go for just over three hours.\nMLC will comprise six teams, from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, New York and Washington, which will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\nTeams will have a maximum of 19 and minimum of 16 players, combining international stars and home-grown players selected through a draft which was made when the league was launched, officially and metaphorically, at Space Center Houston. Each team was allowed to sign nine local players, one of which had to be under-23.\nThe salaries of international players will be drawn from an initial $120 million investment from corporate backers, mainly from India.\nThe teams will play Twenty20 style which might be portrayed as cricket with the dull bits removed. The format may be more appealing to the American sport palate because there is always a winner: if the teams are still tied after both innings — each comprising 20 six-ball overs — a tie-breaking “super over” is played to find the winner.\nMost matches will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, converted to a cricket stadium with 7,200 seats and a grass pitch. Other matches will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nThe league follows the model of professional Twenty20 — or more broadly known as T20 — leagues which already exist in places such as India, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Canada. They’re all supported by a travelling troupe of international players — many of them T20 specialists — who give leagues marquee quality.\nThe most lucrative and glamorous of all these franchise competitions is the Indian Premier League, where the world’s best players are hired by teams owned by Bollywood stars, business giants and other celebrities. The gravitational pull of the IPL has reshaped cricket’s traditional schedules and made many new cricketing millionaires.\nMajor League Cricket inevitably will have some of the Indian Premier League glitz. Four of the six teams are owned and will be run by IPL franchises.\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders will be run by the Knight Riders Group which operate the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. MI New York will be run by the Mumbai Indians, Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas by the GMR Group which runs the Delhi Capitals.\nTwo of Australia’s provincial organizations — Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales — will run the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom respectively.\nMany of the biggest stars from India, Australia and England are involved in test series — more of those five-day matches — but MLC has attracted a strong contingent of seasoned T20 performers.\nBollywood star Shah Rukh Khan co-owns the Knight Riders Group and has recruited West Indies stars Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, England’s Jason Roy, South Africa’s Rilee Rossouw, Australian Adam Zampa and New Zealanders Lockie Ferguson and Martin Guptill.\n“We have assembled a strong and talented team for the debut season of MLC who can compete at the highest level and bring joy to cricket fans around the world,” Knight Riders Group chief executive Venky Mysore said.\nThe Texas Super Kings have hired South Africa’s Faf du Plessis as captain alongside international stars Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, David Miller, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee.\nChennai Super Kings chief executive K.S. Viswanathan said du Plessis “led the Joburg Super Kings at (the South African T20 league) from the front earlier this year and we’re confident of doing well under him in Texas.“\nThe West Indies and Mumbai Indians star Kieron Pollard will captain New York, which will have Robin Peterson as head coach and Lasith Malinga as bowling coach. Their signings include fast bowlers Trent Boult from New Zealand and Kagiso Rabada from South Africa.\nSeattle has Australian star Mitch Marsh and South Africa’s Quinton de Kock.\nMLC has broader ambitions, to build minor leagues in a bid to develop training and development facilities and support the U.S. national team.\nNow it remains to be seen whether American fans will find Major League Cricket to their taste and make the league itself everlasting.\n___\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n                            Save $85 with our best offer.\n                        \n\n                            Cancel Anytime.\n                        \nYour browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:\nSorry, an error occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up with\n\nThank you .\nYour account has been registered, and you are now logged in.\nCheck your email for details.\nInvalid password or account does not exist\nSign in with\nSubmitting this form below will send a message to your email with a link to change your password.\nAn email message containing instructions on how to reset your password has been sent to the email address listed on your account.\nNo promotional rates found.\n\n+ Tax\n\n\n         Secure \u0026 Encrypted\n\n            Secure transaction.\n            Secure transaction.

  "body": " Match Details\n\nChasing a challenging score of 178, the opening pair of Finn Allen and Matthew Wade propelled the San Francisco Unicorns to a rollicking start. The left-handed Wade started the assault by cutting loose in the second over before the Kiwi batter Allen teed off in the following over and thumped the opposition skipper Wayne Parnell for 22 runs. That over included 4 fours and 1 maximum. The right-handed Allen threw his wicket away after a blistering knock of 28(10) owing to a lethargic effort in running between the wickets. \nWade continued his onslaught by smashing Imad Wasim for three consecutive boundaries in the 5th over before the left-arm spinner took retribution and cleaned up the Aussie batter for 28(16). Despite losing two wickets, the early pyrotechnics by Wade and Allen helped the Unicorns orchestrate 67 runs off the powerplay. The Australian duo of Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch failed to capitalize on the laid foundation and slowed down the innings. Both the batters fall victim to left-arm spin and the two wickets in quick succession gathered momentum for the Orcas. The San Francisco innings went haywire as they lost wickets in clusters in the middle overs. Shadab Khan played a valiant knock of 37(23) and tried to drag matter till the end but the Unicorns kept losing wickets at regular intervals and lower-order collapse did not help their cause. Cameron Gannon was the pick of the bowlers for the Orcas and attained exceptional figures of 4/23. Imad Wasim and Andrew Tye also extracted a couple of wickets. Earlier in the day, after winning the coin flip and elected to bat first, Seattle Orcas were off to a ruinous start as Haris Rauf extracted the massive wicket of  Quinton de Kock 7(6) in the second over itself by uprooting the southpaw with a scorcher of a delivery. Both Nauman Anwar and Shehan Jayasuriya negated the new ball well following the early departure of de Kock and helped Orcas to aggregate 53 runs off the powerplay. Anwar and Jayasuriya added 44 runs for the 2nd wicket before Liam Plunkett outsmarted the former with some extra bounce. \nThe South African right-handed Heinrich Klaasen paired up with Jayasuriya and developed another partnership of 47 runs. Klaasen was the primary aggressor in the partnership but the Orcas were able to control the flow of runs in the middle overs. Jayasuriya eventually succumbed to pressure and holed out at 33(27). Klaasen kept attacking the bowlers and registered his maiden half-century in MLC before he threw his wicket away at 53(31). However, his 54-run partnership with Shimron Hetmyer 36*(30) steered the Orcas to a competitive total.

Because, when the speedometer reads 90 mph or more, there's a chance that the lesser mortals go in survival mode and focus on self-preservation rather than going on an all-out offence which is the name of the game in T20 cricket.\nSouth African speedster and now Washington Freedom import Anrich Nortje is easily the fastest bowler in world cricket at the moment alongside England's Mark Wood and is sure to rattle a few batters in the inaugural Major League Cricket tournament. One can only imagine that when even the best batters in the business fail to tackle Nortje's searing pace at times, how would the local players fare against the Protea tearaway.\nAnrich Nortje would be one of the favourites to top the leading wicket takers in the tournament over at betway satta and is 2-1 to be top wicket taker in their opening match against Seattle Orcas\n \nRashid Khan\nIf a tearaway wasn't enough, the MLC batters will have to deal with the mystery spin of Rashid Khan as well who is arguably the best T20 bowler in the world at the moment. Rashid not only captains his national side Afghanistan but has set the global T20 circuit on fire with match-winning performances across the board.\nThe spin maestro was recently part of defending IPL champions Gujarat Titans who ended up as runners-up in the 2023 edition. Along with compatriot Noor Ahmad, Rashid made life hell for the batters and the fate of a lot of teams in MLC will depend on how they tackle the leg spin, the googly, the top spin and a host of other variations from Khan.\n \nTrent Boult\nDepending on the ball used and the atmospheric conditions, Trent Boult will extract massive or little swing in Major League Cricket 2023. Be that as it may, the Kiwi would be a handful to handle for all openers inside the powerplay.\nBoult, who is not part of a traditional central contract with NZC at the moment, has already decided to turn a freelance T20 globetrotter for the remaining years of his career, and will have another opportunity to display his chops in the upcoming competition.\nThe left-armer has the rare ability to bring the ball back into the right-handers from over the wicket and swing the new nut quite late which always poses tough questions for the openers.\n \nSunil Narine\nLike compatriot Andre Russell, Sunil Narine hasn't been at his absolute best over the last couple of years, but the mystery spinner still remains among the best in the world.\nCarrying forward his long-standing association with the Kolkata Knight Riders, Narine will ply his trade for Los Angeles Knight Riders in MLC 2023 alongside Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Lockie Ferguson, Martin Guptill, Adam Zampa, Rilee Rossouw, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan and Unmukt Chand.\nNarine provides great value due to his ability to bowl in any phase of the game - be it the powerplay, the middle overs, or the death. At his prime, Narine not only kept the runs dry but also picked truckloads of wickets. At the fag end of his career, even if he can do one of the two tasks, Los Angeles Knight Riders will have their money's worth. And don't forget his ability with the bat at the top of the order.\n \nLockie Ferguson\nMuch like Anrich Nortje, New Zealand's Lockie Ferguson has the ability to hit 95 mph and is capable of instilling fear in the opposition players - particularly the local batters.\nLockie Ferguson did not have a great IPL 2023, but he is a tried and tested player who hasn't compromised on his pace over the years. Used by New Zealand as a middle overs enforcer in the 2019 ODI World Cup, Ferguson can play the same role for Los Angeles Knight Riders, and with some distinction.\n \n© Cricket World 2023"

  "body": "USA's new Major League Cricket makes big hitting start\nMajor League Cricket got underway in Texas on Thursday, and the most serious attempt yet to establish a domestic competition in the United States provided all the ingredients of a modern Twenty20 league.\nFans at the purpose built cricket stadium, just a 15-minute drive from Dallas Fort Worth airport, were decked out in the yellow shirts of the victorious home side, the Texas Super Kings, and were treated to the familiar sight of big sixes and non-stop action.\nThe Super Kings won by 69 runs after making 181 for six and then bowling out the Los Angeles Knight Riders for 112.\nAny concerns that cricket in America might not be the real deal vanished when the action got under way and the crowd began cheering the big hitting of the home team.\nThe stadium previously belonged to the now defunct Texas Airhogs minor league baseball club, but since taking over the venue, MLC has spent over $20 million making it cricket-specific.\nFor viewers watching the TV broadcast, it would have been hard to tell the difference between MLC and the other T20 tournaments that have sprung up around the world.\nWith international players competing alongside domestic talent from the USA national team, the standard of play was clearly professional and the field and wicket looked up to scratch.\nThat was in marked contrast to many previous, short-lived attempts to \"break the American market\" with one-off events in unsuitable venues, and was also light years away from much of the domestic cricket, which for years was played on matting tracks.\nTexas' South African bowler Rusty Theron was taken aback by the success of the opening game.\n\"I am actually a little bit emotional, to be honest. This is such a grand event. There was an unbelievable atmosphere and I want to thank each and every individual who has come out here,\" he said.\nSuper Kings batsman David Miller, who was awarded Player of the Match, for his hard-hitting 61 from 42 balls, including four sixes, was also impressed.\n\"It's fantastic to see such a great turn out and the facilities have been fantastic. I think there have been a few guys, kind of questioned around what it was going to be like but it shot the lights out here,\" said the South African, one of a number of players with a background in the world's top Twenty20 competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nMLC has backing from four IPL franchises including the Mumbai Indians, whose New York team began play on Friday.\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\nsev/dhw\nSlovakia says 'informed' EU it's halting military aid to Ukraine\nHurricane causes 27 deaths, severe damage in Mexico's Acapulco\nHamas says Israeli strikes killed hostages\nOur Apps"

MI New York had a shaky start to their innings, as opener Monank Patel (2) lost his wicket cheaply by the third over.\nGet Club Cricket SA news on Whatsapp\nShayan Jahangir (19) soon followed him back to the pavilion as he failed to build on his start. New York was struggling to put runs on the board as Hammad Azam (2) lost his wicket in the seventh over soon after MI had crossed the 50-run mark. Nicholas Pooran and Captain of MI New York, Kieron Pollard constructed a crucial partnership that steadied the ship for their team.\nNew York came back roaring back into the game thanks to Pooran (68), who lost his wicket in the thirteenth over after scoring a blistering half-century and guiding his team past 100 runs. Pollard (34) lost his wicket in the following over as the scores for MI New York read 132 runs for the loss of 5 wickets.\nA steady partnership between Tim David and David Wiese saw New York go past 150 runs. However, Tim David (18) failed to build on his solid start as he lost his wicket at the start of the eighteenth over. Rashid Khan (2) lost his wicket cheaply in the subsequent over soon after which Wiese (19) followed suit.\nNosthush Kenjige (3*) and Trent Boult (20*) scored 22 runs in the final over of their team’s innings that saw MI New York end their 20 overs with a total of 194 runs for the loss of eight wickets. Imad Wasim and Harmeet Singh picked up two wickets each for the Seattle Orcas, while Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye picked up a wicket each.\nThe Seattle Orcas had a decent start to the second innings, but Quinton de Kock (9) failed to build a fruitful partnership with Nauman Anwar as he lost his wicket at the start of the fourth over. Shehan Jayasuriya (0) followed de Kock back to the pavilion at the start of the sixth over as he failed to trouble the scorers.\nNauman Anwar and in-form Heinrich Klaasen carefully constructed a partnership that helped the Orcas cross the 50-run mark in the eighth over. Anwar (51) scored a crucial half-century before he lost his wicket in the eleventh over right as the Orcas were on the cusp of crossing the 100-run mark.\nHeinrich Klaasen was anchoring the Orcas innings, while wickets were falling around him. Shubham Ranjane (7) lost his wicket cheaply in the thirteenth over and was soon followed by Dasun Shanaka (10) back to the pavilion.\nWhile Klaasen scored a stunning half-century, Dwaine Pretorious (2) lost his wicket at the start of the eighteenth over. Imad Wasim (0) and Harmeet Singh (0) had lost their wickets by the end of the eighteenth over without troubling the scorers. Going into the final two overs of the second inning, the Orcas still needed 19 runs to win as the game was headed for a nail-biting finish.\nSpearheading the attack for the Orcas, Klaasen scored the first-ever century in Major League Cricket. As the game entered its final over, Seattle needed six runs to win and the Orcas pulled off a triumph thanks to a game-winning six by Klaasen off the second ball of the nineteenth over. Klaasen remained unbeaten with 110 runs off 44 balls as he single-handedly led the Orcas to victory.\nTrent Boult bowled superbly and picked up four wickets for MI New York, while Rashid Khan picked up two wickets.

The ripples of excitement for Major League Cricket (MLC) are spreading far and wide, promising to revolutionise the American sports landscape. This quintessentially British game, with a rich tapestry of tradition, is poised to make a grand entry into the heart of America, aiming to captivate audiences with its unique blend of strategy, skill, and suspense. The key question remains: Will Major League Cricket hit a sixer in the American sports industry, or will it be caught out? Read and explore the potential of this new entrant and discuss a little bit more about this American Venture.\nThough not widely recognized as an American sport today, cricket has a rich history in the United States. In the early 1700s, it was brought to the American shores by English colonists. By the mid-1800s, cricket was a well-established sport in America, with Philadelphia being the hub of American cricket. The USA and Canada played in the first-ever international cricket match in 1844.\nMajor League Cricket is an ambitious project launched by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in partnership with USA Cricket. The goal is to establish a professional T20 cricket league in the United States, showcasing the best of cricket to the American audience. The inaugural season took place on July 13 2023 and will be concluded on July 30 2023.\nACE has made significant strides in developing infrastructure for cricket in America. They've taken over the management of a baseball stadium in Texas, which will be refurbished into a dedicated cricketing venue. Furthermore, ACE has plans to build additional stadiums and training facilities across the country. The league is expected to provide a platform for American cricketers to showcase their skills and help raise the standard of cricket in the country.\nThere are six teams set to lock horns with each other. Those are Texas Super Kings, Seattle Orcas, MI New York, Washington Freedom, San Francisco Unicorns, and Los Angeles Knight Riders. \nClick here to get the full fixture – MLC 2023\nThe potential for cricket in America is immense. The United States is a melting pot of cultures with a large immigrant population from cricket-loving countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Caribbean. This provides a ready fan base for cricket.\nMoreover, the T20 format of it is likely to appeal to the American audience. It's a shorter, more dynamic version of cricket, packed with action. It's similar to baseball in terms of duration and pace, making it easier for Americans to understand and enjoy.\nThe commercial potential of MLC is also significant. The American sports market is one of the most lucrative in the world. If it succeeds in capturing even a fraction of this market, it could spur phenomenal growth for cricket.\nThe future of it largely depends on its execution. If done right, MLC could revolutionise the American sports landscape. It could provide a fresh alternative to traditional American sports, offering a unique blend of strategy, skill, and suspense.\nThe key to MLC's success will be to build a strong connection with the American audience. This means investing in grassroots development, promoting the sport in schools and colleges, and creating opportunities for young Americans to take up cricket.\nFurthermore, MLC will need to leverage its diverse fan base, catering to both traditional American sports fans and immigrants from cricket-loving nations. Strategic marketing, exciting gameplay, and engaging fan experiences will be critical in attracting and retaining fans.\nThe question of whether MLC can become America's next big thing is intriguing. There's potential for sure. The United States is a sports-loving nation with a diverse population and a lucrative sports market. The T20 format of MLC, with its fast pace and high action, could potentially resonate with the American audience.\nHowever, turning potential into reality is not going to be easy. It faces stiff competition from established sports. It will need to overcome numerous challenges, from building awareness and interest in cricket, to fostering local talent and competing for viewership and sponsorship deals.\nYet, the journey of soccer in America provides hope. Once a fringe sport, soccer has grown tremendously over the past few decades, thanks in large part to the success of Major League Soccer. If MLC can replicate this success, cricket could indeed become America's next big thing.\nMajor League Cricket has the potential to revolutionise the American sports landscape, offering a fresh alternative to traditional sports. The stage is set, the players are already on the pitch, and the cricketing world watches with bated breath. Will MLC hit a sixer in the American sports industry, or will it be caught out?

  "body": "-\nGRAND PRAIRIE, Texas —The promise of cricket in America could be seen and felt in the most unlikely of circumstances. Awash in Friday night lights after a scorching Texas sun, the trim green cricket oval invited fanatics and families alike to watch the Seattle Orcas chase the Washington D.C. Freedom’s 144 runs.\n“Deep in the Heart of Texas” played cheerfully from the loudspeakers during a brief break in the action, and local law enforcement — sporting straw cowboy hats and boots — looked on in bewilderment. Major League Cricket debuted last week, the cricketing world’s American Dream, a new field of dreams.\nUnlike the seesaw, to-and-fro of baseball innings, the format of cricket known as T-20 is played politely with one team batting until 20 overs (120 balls) are thrown – around the same number thrown by a baseball team in nine innings. During a cricket game’s overs, the batting squad attempts to score as many runs as possible while the bowling team, the defense, attempts to take the batting team’s wickets. Batting ends when 10 wickets are taken or 20 overs are completed, whichever comes first.\nIn the opening innings, DC had scored 144 runs and lost 7 wickets. Now it was up to Seattle’s assortment of Indian, Pakistani, South African, Sri Lankan, West Indies, and US players to beat that score. Seattle displayed an offense not unlike past Mariners teams – slow but steady small ball.\nAfter 8 overs, Seattle still needed 101 runs. With 2 overs remaining, they needed 17. Imad Wasim of Pakistan and Shimron Hetmyer from the West Indies formed a partnership that produced a pair of 6s (baseball’s equivalent of a homerun), and Shubham Ranjane came up with the winning hit for 4 (something like a ground rule double) after Hetmyer was dismissed.\nThe Seattle Orcas won their inaugural match Friday night with 148 runs and 5 lost wickets. They followed their thrilling victory with another win Saturday night over the San Francisco Unicorns, this time in a more decisive manner, 177 runs and 4 wickets. The Orcas took all 10 San Francisco wickets after the Unicorns put up just 142 runs. Orcas batsman Heinrich Klaasen of South Africa scored the franchise’s first “half-century,” putting up 53 runs.\nIn 2015, I wrote an article posing a question: Could cricket in the U.S. be a worthwhile investment? I flew to New York City to watch a tour of the world’s cricketing all-stars because, having fallen in love with the sport thanks to business travel to India and England, I was curious about its viability in America.\nNot long ago, the idea that Major League Soccer franchises would pop up in cities across America, each competing for international talent. Soccer was a dream to some, and a joke to others. But cricket? It’s too complicated. Don’t matches stretch on for days? It will never work. Or might the MLC and the Indian diaspora attract a legend at the end of his career, such as MLS and its “soccer is life” Latino population attracted Messi to Miami?\nThe night before Seattle’s match, the Texas Super Kings played the LA Knight Riders tocommence tournament play. Ross Perot Jr’s Super Kings beat the Knight Riders by a score of 181 runs and the loss of 6 wickets to 112 runs with the loss of all 10 wickets. (Thanks to an agreement with the Indian Premier League (IPL), several of the American teams share IPL mascots. Chenai and Texas are the Super Kings, Mumbai and New York are the Indians, Kolkata and Los Angeles are the Knight Riders.)\nAll six teams — Texas, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. — began this week’s tournament in Texas, to be continued in North Carolina, and then return to Texas for the playoffs on July 27. The scene in Grand Prairie Major League Cricket debuted to a sellout crowd of around 7,000 fans with the kind of diversity the NFL, the NBA, and MLB can only dream about. Television networks from around the world, including America’s Willow cable channel, broadcast the game live to hundreds of millions in cricket-mad places like India, Australia and New Zealand, the UK, and South Africa. International news outlets have run coverage almost hourly through the weekend.\nMLC took over an abandoned independent league baseball stadium (the Airhogs) in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, and invested heavily in a world class cricket oval. There, fans in Dallas Cowboys gear and Bass Pro Shop hats mixed with the national team jerseys from every cricket  nation. Country and Western, Bollywood, and hip-hop blasted overhead. Fans munched on chickpeas and rice seasoned with Tex-Mex Chipotle hot sauce.\nThe Dallas metroplex made for a surprising backdrop. Looming over the new cricket stadium is Lone Star Park, a hulking horseracing venue. Soaring above the racetrack’s spire, commercial jets take off and land from nearby DFW Airport.\nInside the arena, an English gentleman from Birmingham, more recently residing in Jacksonville, stayed over in Dallas when he learned he could catch the first-ever Major League Cricket game. Tim Miller, 54, and his son Iain, 18, live locally in the Dallas metroplex and were standing near the field an hour before the action began. Iain began playing with friends, mostly Indian, in a nearby park as the pandemic began. He fell in love with the game and has now tried out for an Under-19 team. He and his father watch cricket on Willow.\nMark Roberts and his kids, 10 and 13, drove 12 hours from Fort Collins, Colo., to see the launch. Dad took an interest in 2018 when he stumbled across the sport on Willow. He wanted to introduce his kids to cricket because “it’s a better alternative to baseball.” Why? The action. Like a winter league baseball game in the Caribbean, fans blew whistles and anticipated, and then reacted to, every play of the game. \nBy all accounts, the cricket grounds and the quality of play were top-notch. Likewise, the league clearly invested in slick, professional video and merchandise. Orcas cricket is backed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Madrona Venture Group Managing Director S. Soma Somasegar; Icertis co-founder and CEO Samir Bodas; GreatPoint Ventures managing partner Ashok Krishnamurthi; and former Microsoft and Avalara executive Sanjay Parthasarathy.\nSoma and his family attended both Orcas games over the weekend. “We have love and passion for the sport we grew up with,” he said. “We wanted to give back to the community, to create an exciting space for kids and families. Seattle was not a day one city for the league, but we have an important base to build upon.”\nHe pointed out that the US and Seattle should be part of the world’s second most popular sport. “Sports bring people from different perspectives together,” he said. “ We want to unify.” Tech hubs like Seattle and Silicon Valley in California have long attracted software programmers from India. The Asian Indian population in the US has grown steadily, rising from 2 million in 2000 to more than 5 million today.\nIn the Seattle area, Microsoft is incorporating a recreational cricket pitch on its new campus in Redmond. King County’s Marymoor Park, where Seattle’s amateur league has played for decades, envisions its own professionally-run stadium.\nWhat’s next for MLC? Seattle will play three more matches in Morristown, N.C., over the weekend. The teams return to Texas for the championship round. Beyond that, it’s a little uncertain. MLC franchises expect to have their grounds in order by the 2025 season. Tom Dunmore, who heads MLC marketing, said the hope is that 2025 will be the first regular season.\nNext year, the United States and the West Indies (Jamaica, Bahamas, Antigua) will co-host cricket’s World Cup. The International Cricket Committee (ICC), the equivalent of soccer’s FIFA, is currently working to identify host cities. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland are possibilities. With the Oakland Athletics heading to Las Vegas, that could open up a suitable stadium. The Oakland Coliseum is known for its generous foul territory, which would enable a proper cricket oval.\nDunmore says MLC will wait to see what the ICC comes up with, and perhaps next year’s MLC tournament could be played on a World Cup pitch. “Not to be cliché, but if you build it people will come,” Dunmore said.\nA little more Cricket 101 on how the game is played  More than 10 years ago on a trip to New Delhi, I downloaded Cricket for Dummies in order to be conversant on the subject since the Australian national team was touring India. The test match, this one played over weeks, was all anyone wanted to talk about.\nStill puzzled? Here’s a short lesson that might be helpful. As in baseball, a batsman (batter) stands before a bowler (pitcher) and swings at pace balls (fastballs) and spin or swing balls (curves and sliders) attempting score runs. The batsman can score 1-3 runs with hits inside the boundary (fence) or 4 runs at once if a fielder fails to stop the ball from exiting the boundary. If the batsman clears the boundary in the air, it’s 6 runs.\nAnd what are wickets? Wickets are taken by the defense. The defense can take a wicket by catching the ball in the air, smacking the stumps behind the batsman or hitting the batsman’s leg pads without contact with the bat. A batsman can stand at the crease (like baseball’s plate) all day if the defense cannot take the wicket.\nThis short season is a very good “soft launch” for MLC, and the oval at Morristown (a Raleigh suburb) equals any in the major, test-playing countries. What MLC should do is to direct fans after the season to Minor League Cricket, which has 20-odd teams across the country and plays games in the local markets, as a way to get more fans exposure to in-person cricket. The 2022 MiLC champion Seattle Thunderbolts produced the Orcas’ Harmeet Singh, as well as players like Andries Gous and Shadley van Shalkwyk, who were drafted by other MLC teams.\nI wish the US co-hosting the T-20 World Cup could be pushed back for a few more years so Seattle could host matches. Our sizable South Asian population would flock to the games, and the Marymoor Park oval will have a Link station, which would ease access for many fans and visitors.\nSeattle used to wish to join major leagues in sports. Now the focus is wider — world sports such as soccer and cricket — in part because our global corporations draw people from the wide world, particularly India, Russia, Israel, China, and Canada. What’s baseball to them? Next trend: American sports go global.\nYup. Look up the European League of Football on YouTube. And it’s not just former US college football veterans; the majority of the players per team must be non-American.\n\n                            \n                            Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n                          \n Notify me of follow-up comments by email.\n Notify me of new posts by email.\n \n\n\n\nΔ\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

(Pic Credit: MLC)\nSan Francisco Unicorns collected their second victory and moved to the third spot on the points table after defeating Los Angeles Knight Riders by 21 runs in Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas on Tuesday. However, the Knight Riders are yet to register a victory in the competition and are currently at the bottom of the points table. The Unicorns posted 212/7 in their 20 overs before restricting the Los Angeles Knight Riders to 191/5.\nThe Knight Riders’ opening batter Jason Roy struck a six and a four off Carmi le Roux’s bowling in the very first over. Roy looked in terrific touch as he continued to hit boundaries and sixes for his side, however, he was bowled out by Haris Rauf for 45 runs from 21 balls in the fifth over. Soon after, Unmukt Chand also followed his opening partner back to the pavilion after he was dismissed by Chaitanya Bishnoi for 20 runs off 17 balls.\nNitish Kumar struck three consecutive boundaries off Corey Anderson’s bowling before he was dismissed for 31 off 23 balls in the eleventh over. Thereafter, the Knight Riders were reeling at 116/5 after losing Rilee Rossouw and Jaskaran Malhotra in quick succession. Andre Russell and Sunil Narine smashed two boundaries and seven sixes in the last few overs, but the Unicorns stayed ahead in the game throughout the innings.\nEarlier in the day, San Francisco Unicorns won the toss and elected to bat first. Matthew Wade got the Unicorns off to a flying start with a six and a four in the second over. Wade continued to strike the ball beautifully as he smashed four boundaries and two sixes in the sixth over. Finn Allen also joined the party as he hit Adam Zampa for a six and a four to take the Unicorns to 87/0 in seven overs. However, Captain Sunil Narine found the first breakthrough for the Knight Riders when he dismissed Allen for 20 runs off 19 balls in the eighth over.\nBut, Marcus Stoinis kept the momentum on the San Francisco Unicorns’ side as he struck three maximums and a boundary off Zampa to take his team to 113/1 in nine overs. Stoinis found two more boundaries before he was sent back to the pavilion by Andre Russell for 37 runs off 18 balls. Matthew Wade fell to Ali Khan for 78 runs off 41 balls soon after, however, Corey Anderson’s blistering innings of 39 runs from 20 deliveries, laced with three boundaries and three sixes, took the Unicorns to a formidable total of 212/7 in their 20 overs.\nBrief Scores: San Francisco Unicorns 212/7 (Matthew Wade 78, Corey Anderson 39, Adam Zampa 3/41) beat Los Angeles Knight Riders 191/5 (Jason Roy 45, Andre Russell 42*, Shadab Khan 2/26) by 21 runs"

  "body": "HomeNews Heinrich Klaasen Slams First Ever Century In Major League Cricket\nHeinch Klaasen (source: MLC)\nTHE SEATTLE Orcas secured a classy victory in Major League Cricket after defeating MI New York by two wickets at Church Street Park, Morrisville on Tuesday. Heinrich Klaasen scored the first-ever century of the MLC as he played a magnificent unbeaten knock of 110 runs off 44 balls to guide the Orcas to victory in a high-scoring match.\nThe Seattle Orcas won the toss and elected to bowl first. MI New York had a shaky start to their innings, as opener Monank Patel (2) lost his wicket cheaply by the third over. Shayan Jahangir (19) soon followed him back to the pavilion as he failed to build on his start.\nNew York was struggling to put runs on the board as Hammad Azam (2) lost his wicket in the seventh over soon after MI had crossed the 50-run mark. Nicholas Pooran and Captain of MI New York, Kieron Pollard constructed a crucial partnership that steadied the ship for their team.\nNew York came back roaring back into the game thanks to Pooran (68), who lost his wicket in the thirteenth over after scoring a blistering half-century and guiding his team past 100 runs. Pollard (34) lost his wicket in the following over as the scores for MI New York read 132 runs for the loss of 5 wickets.\nA steady partnership between Tim David and David Wiese saw New York go past 150 runs. However, Tim David (18) failed to build on his solid start as he lost his wicket at the start of the eighteenth over. Rashid Khan (2) lost his wicket cheaply in the subsequent over soon after which Wiese (19) followed suit.\nNosthush Kenjige (3) and Trent Boult (20) scored 22 runs in the final over of their team’s innings that saw MI New York end their 20 overs with a total of 194 runs for the loss of eight wickets. Imad Wasim and Harmeet Singh picked up two wickets each for the Seattle Orcas, while Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye picked up a wicket each.\nThe Seattle Orcas had a decent start to the second innings, but Quinton de Kock (9) failed to build a fruitful partnership with Nauman Anwar as he lost his wicket at the start of the fourth over. Shehan Jayasuriya (0) followed de Kock back to the pavilion at the start of the sixth over as he failed to trouble the scorers.\nNauman Anwar and in-form Heinrich Klaasen carefully constructed a partnership that helped the Orcas cross the 50-run mark in the eighth over. Anwar (51) scored a crucial half-century before he lost his wicket in the eleventh over right as the Orcas were on the cusp of crossing the 100-run mark.\nHeinrich Klaasen was anchoring the Orcas innings, while wickets were falling around him. Shubham Ranjane (7) lost his wicket cheaply in the thirteenth over and was soon followed by Dasun Shanaka (10) back to the pavilion. While Klaasen scored a stunning half-century, Dwaine Pretorious (2) lost his wicket at the start of the eighteenth over.\nImad Wasim (0) and Harmeet Singh (0) had lost their wickets by the end of the eighteenth over without troubling the scorers. Going into the final two overs of the second inning, the Orcas still needed 19 runs to win as the game was headed for a nail-biting finish.\nSpearheading the attack for the Orcas, Klaasen scored the first-ever century in Major League Cricket. As the game entered its final over, Seattle needed six runs to win and the Orcas pulled off a triumph thanks to a game-winning six by Klaasen off the second ball of the nineteenth over.\nKlaasen remained unbeaten with 110 runs off 44 balls as he single-handedly led the Orcas to victory. Trent Boult bowled superbly and picked up four wickets for MI New York, while Rashid Khan picked up two wickets. David Wiese and Nosthush Kenjige chipped in with one wicket each.\nTags:\n© 2023 Indiadotcom Digital. Private Limited.

Being the first season, it commenced with a match between Texas Super Kings and LA Knight Riders on the 13th of July while MI New York won the grand final against Seattle Orcas on the 31st of July in Dallas.
