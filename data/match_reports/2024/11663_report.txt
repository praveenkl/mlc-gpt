His unbeaten half-century included 4 fours and 2 sixes, a crucial contribution that earned him the Man of the Match title.

Supporting Anderson, Hassan K contributed a valuable 44 off 35 balls, accelerating the team's momentum. However, the Unicorns faced significant resistance from MI New York’s bowling attack, particularly from N Kenjige, who delivered an economical spell of 2/13 in his quota of 4 overs. Trent Boult also bagged two wickets, conceding 35 runs, while Rashid Khan added another wicket to his tally, giving away 26 runs in his 4 overs.

In reply, MI New York fell agonizingly short, finishing their innings at 145/6. Dewald Brevis spearheaded the chase with a solid 56 off 36 balls, including 4 boundaries and 3 sixes. Despite his determined effort and some late fireworks from Hardus Richards, who scored a quickfire 24 off 13 balls, MI New York could not cross the finish line. Nicholas Pooran chipped in with a steady 26 runs, but the collective effort wasn’t quite enough.

The Unicorns' bowlers held their nerve during crucial stages of the match. Matthew Short emerged as the bowling hero for the Unicorns, claiming 3 wickets for 27 runs in his complete 4 overs. Billy Couch backed him up well with a spell of 2/27. Hassan K also made his mark with the ball, capturing 1 wicket for just 9 runs in his 2 overs. Anderson, although not impactful with the ball (0/4 in 0.1 overs), had already done the damage with his bat.

Some key milestones punctuated the match, adding to the drama and intensity. For instance, Brevis reached his half-century in style, flicking a full-length delivery from Cummins to the deep square leg boundary. Anderson attained his fifty with a powerful pull shot off Rashid Khan, sending the ball into the stands at deep mid-wicket. Team milestones also highlighted crucial junctures in the game, such as MI New York reaching 104/4 in 15.3 overs with a spectacular slog over deep mid-wicket for a maximum off Matthew Short’s bowling.

In conclusion, it was a nail-biting finish that saw San Francisco Unicorns claim victory by a narrow margin, thanks to a stellar performance from Corey Anderson and significant contributions from their bowlers.
