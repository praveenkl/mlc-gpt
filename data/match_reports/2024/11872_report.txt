In an exhilarating T20 encounter at the Grand Prairie Stadium, the San Francisco Unicorns triumphed over the Washington Freedom by six wickets in a high-scoring thriller. The Unicorns elected to field after winning the toss, a decision that would set the stage for a breathtaking chase.

Washington Freedom set a formidable target, posting 174/3 in 15.3 overs. Steven Smith and Travis Head were the stars with the bat for Washington, each scoring 56 runs—Smith off 31 balls and Head off 36, respectively. Their efforts were bolstered by quick contributions from A Gous and Rachin Ravindra, who chipped in with 29 (20) and 16 (6) runs. Corey Anderson emerged as the standout bowler for the Unicorns, claiming 2 wickets for 20 runs in his 2 overs.

San Francisco began their chase with both aggression and poise. The innings was spearheaded by the man of the match, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, whose scintillating 79 off 42 balls set the tone. His half-century came off 28 balls, featuring 4 fours and 3 sixes, a vital milestone that ignited the chase. He was supported brilliantly by Josh Inglis, who blasted 45 off just 17 deliveries, and Hassan Khan, who smashed 32 off 11 balls, ensuring the Unicorns maintained their momentum throughout. J McGurk added a valuable 18 off 9 balls as the Unicorns reached their target in 13.4 overs, finishing at 177/4.

The match saw several key moments that defined its outcome. At 11.5 overs, Krishnamurthi's magnificent six off Andrew Tye brought the Unicorns to 154/4, a pivotal juncture that turned the tide. Tye himself was the standout bowler for Washington, securing 3 wickets for 41 runs in his 3 overs, but his efforts were in vain as the Unicorns' batsmen were unstoppable.

Washington’s innings also had its milestones, with Travis Head reaching 50 off 34 balls and Steven Smith achieving the same off just 25 balls, each peppering the boundary frequently to set a challenging target.
