MI NY's innings was highlighted by Tim David, who dazzled the crowd with a scintillating knock of 48 runs off just 21 deliveries. His innings included explosive hitting, as showcased by a towering six off Andre Russell's bowling in the 20th over, helping MI NY rack up a total of 155/8 in their 20 overs. Nicholas Pooran also contributed with a steady 38 from 37 balls, while Dewald Brevis added a quickfire 15 off just 7 balls to keep the momentum going.
