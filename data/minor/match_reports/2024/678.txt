Raymond Ramrattan (14 off 17 balls) and Supreet Madaan (17 off 20 balls) provided some resistance but couldn't convert their starts into bigger scores. However, it was Hiren Patel who steadied the ship for the Stallions with a crucial innings of 24 runs off 18 balls, which included two boundaries and a six, and Md Farhad Reza chipped in with a valuable 23 off 23 balls, hitting two sixes and stabilizing the middle order.

Chasing a revised target under the D/L method, the Cavaliers crumbled against the Stallions' fierce bowling attack, managing just 64 runs in their 18 overs.

Rushik Rajendra Patel added two wickets to his tally, with Muhammad Usman Saeed (2) and Steven Katwaroo (1) failing to capitalize on their starts. Rishi Shimpi fought a lone battle scoring 18 runs off a patient 38 balls, while Abdullah Ghazi contributed 16 off 16.
