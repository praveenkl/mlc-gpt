In an exciting encounter at the Minor League Cricket (MiLC) tournament, the Houston Hurricanes edged past the Lone Star Athletics by a narrow margin of 3 runs. Batting first, the Hurricanes posted a score of 151 for 6 in their allotted 20 overs, thanks to a crucial knock from Lahiru Milantha, who scored a brisk 38 off 27 balls, supported by valuable contributions from Mukhtar Ahmed and Saif Badar, who added 33 and 29 runs respectively.

Houston faced some tight bowling, particularly from Naqash Basharat, who delivered an impressive spell, conceding only 16 runs in his 4 overs while picking up a wicket. Milind Kumar also played a vital role, claiming two important wickets for 44 runs, which helped to check the scoring rate at crucial moments. However, the wide count of 10 extras from the Lone Star Athletics proved to be costly in the end.

In response, Lone Star Athletics fought hard to chase down the target. Milind Kumar was the standout performer for them with the bat, scoring an aggressive 60 off 42 balls, but unfortunately ran himself out at a critical juncture, a moment that shifted the momentum back to the Hurricanes. Awais Zia tried to anchor the innings with 28 off 23 deliveries, but regular fall of wickets hampered their progress.

Matthew Tromp was exceptional with the ball for the Hurricanes, claiming 2 wickets for 26 runs in his 4 overs, including the crucial wicket of Milind Kumar. Usman Shinwari also contributed significantly with two wickets, putting the brakes on Lone Starâ€™s chase.

The Athletics fought valiantly, losing wickets at regular intervals, and despite a late flurry of runs, they fell agonizingly short, finishing their innings at 148 for 8 in the full quota of 20 overs. This thrilling finish underscored the nail-biting nature of T20 cricket, where each run and each ball can change the course of the game.

In the end, Houston Hurricanes' disciplined bowling and steady fielding saw them home, clinching victory by just 3 runs, and adding valuable points to their tally in the league standings. The match will be remembered for its tight finish and spirited performances from both sides, highlighting the competitive nature of the MiLC tournament.
