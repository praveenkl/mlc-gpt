Batting first, the Houston Hurricanes set a formidable target by scoring 172 runs in their allotted 20 overs for the loss of five wickets. Opening batsman Mukhtar Ahmed contributed 29 runs off 24 balls, hitting three boundaries and two sixes, providing a brisk start to the innings. Despite losing wickets at regular intervals, Saif Badar anchored the innings with a brilliant knock of 62 runs off 37 balls, including three fours and four sixes. Matthew Tromp also played a crucial role with a solid 47 runs off 29 balls, ensuring that the Hurricanes piled up a competitive total.

The Chicago Tigers bowlers had their moments, especially Raj Vyas and Sai Charith Daggupati, who picked up two wickets each. However, the Hurricanes' batsmen were able to counterattack effectively, accumulating runs and keeping the momentum in their favor.

Chasing a target of 173 runs, the Chicago Tigers found themselves struggling against a disciplined performance by the Hurricanes' bowlers. The Tigers got off to a steady start with opener Jay Desai scoring 28 runs, but it was Usman Rafiq and Mukhtar Ahmed who ripped through the Tigers' batting lineup. Rafiq picked up four vital wickets, dismissing key batsmen like Mittansh Nithiyanandam and Rahul Basu, while conceding only 28 runs in his four-over spell. Ahmed was the star with the ball, claiming a match-winning five-wicket haul in just 3.5 overs, for a meager nine runs.

Though some of the Tigers' batsmen managed a few starts, they lost wickets in quick succession, which dented any hopes of chasing down the target. Calvin Savage tried to provide some resistance with a quickfire 19 off 11 balls, but the Tigers fell short at 125 in 18.5 overs, securing a 47-run win for the Hurricanes.
