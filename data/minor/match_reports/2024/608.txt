The top order tried to build momentum with Christopher Van Tull and Ryan Scott contributing scores of 16 and 21, respectively.

The middle order of the Stallions, however, found some stability with Supreet Madaan’s measured 23 runs and Rohan Mustafa’s contribution. The late charge was led by Md Farhad Reza, with a swift 18 off 11 balls, and Stephen Wiig, who delivered the crucial blow with a fiery 27 off just 9 deliveries, featuring two fours and two sixes, ensuring the Stallions crept over the line to finish with a total of 140 in 19 overs for the loss of six wickets.
