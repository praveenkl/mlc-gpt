Vikash Mohan and Usman Ghani also made significant contributions, scoring 33 and a rapid 35 off 16 balls, with Ghani's innings featuring five towering sixes.

The decisive knock came from Hammad Azam, whose blistering 53 off just 23 deliveries, packed with 6 boundaries and 3 maximums, turned the game in the Kingsmen's favor. Despite losing Azam in the 18th over, they were well on course to chase down the target. Anwar Ali Khan provided the final push, ensuring the Kingsmen reached the required 173 runs with 11 balls to spare.

East Bay Blazers' bowling attack tried to hold back the opposition with Carmi Le Roux and Vikash Mohan both taking two wickets each, but they couldn't quite stem the flow of runs as the Kingsmen kept the required run rate in check.
