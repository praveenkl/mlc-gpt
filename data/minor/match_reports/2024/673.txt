On September 28, 2024, the Lone Star Athletics claimed a comfortable victory against the Chicago Tigers, winning by six wickets in a straightforward chase at the LeagueLone Star venue. 

Chicago Tigers, after winning the toss and opting to bat first, struggled to build a significant partnership. They faced immediate setbacks with the early departure of Mittansh Nithiyanandam, trapped lbw by Imran Khan Jr. for a duck. Jay Desai and Shiv Shani steadied the innings, exhibiting resilience with Desai scoring a patient 40 off 35 balls and Shani adding a more fluent 59 off 50 balls, peppered with six fours and a six. Despite their efforts, the middle and lower order crumbled under the pressure exerted by Naqash Basharat who took an impressive 5-wicket haul for 24 runs in 4 overs, wreaking havoc through the Tigers' lineup. With Imran Khan Jr. contributing 2 wickets, the Tigers managed to post a total of 146 for 8 in their allotted 20 overs.

In response, Lone Star Athletics crafted a well-structured chase, spearheaded by Awais Zia's explosive knock of 69 runs off 43 balls, laced with nine fours and a six. His innings set the foundation for a successful run chase. Despite losing Sidhesh Pathare and Muhammad Usman early, who were caught cheaply, Shatrughan Rambhran supported with a quickfire 28 off just 19 balls, while Kamran Sheikh also contributed with a brisk 19 from 10 deliveries. The Athletics reached the target comfortably in 15.4 overs, concluding their innings at 149 for 4, maintaining a steady scoring rate throughout and capitalizing on the Tigers’ leaking extras which included 8 wides and 1 no-ball.

Chicago Tigers’ bowlers, despite their efforts, struggled against Lone Star's aggressive batting. Soumen Das and Sai Charith Daggupati managed to pick up a wicket each, but the consistent pressure was absent, allowing the Athletics' batsmen to play freely.

In conclusion, Lone Star Athletics displayed an all-round performance with a strong bowling showcase led by Naqash Basharat and a dominant batting response, ensuring their triumph over the Chicago Tigers, thus securing an emphatic win in the minor league cricket tournament.
