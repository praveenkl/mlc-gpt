Isaiah Rajah added a little flair with his 14 runs from 10 balls, including two boundary shots, but was caught by Sunny Patel off the bowling of Chaithanya Kumar Chava.

The middle order was stabilized by Mario Rampersaud, who played a crucial innings of 53 runs off 36 balls, displaying commendable skill by hitting 6 fours and 2 sixes.
