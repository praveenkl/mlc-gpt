Atlanta Fire, having won the toss, decided to bat first.

Hamilton showcased some resilience, scoring 28 runs off 27 balls before falling prey to Sarbjeet Ladda. Meanwhile, Aksh Dave played a more aggressive knock, hitting 41 off 30 balls, laced with two fours and three sixes, before he was smartly stumped by Aaryan Malek off Ladda's bowling.

Paul Palmer provided some much-needed middle-order stability with a composed 40 runs from 37 balls. However, the lower order crumbled under the pressure of tight bowling by the Royals. Muhammad Zaid Alam excelled with the ball, claiming figures of 3 for 21 in his 4 overs, while Sarbjeet Ladda chipped in with 2 wickets for 15 runs. Atlanta Fire managed to post a total of 139 in 20.1 overs, a score bolstered by some extras late in the innings.

However, Abdulahad Malek steadied the innings with a crucial 41 runs off 36 balls, showcasing his ability to handle the fiery attack. Raunaq Sharma and Mohammad Mohsin provided the necessary acceleration later in the innings, with Sharma scoring 35 off 27 and Mohsin a quickfire 35 off just 18 balls.

The Royals faced a temporary collapse in the middle, losing wickets quickly as the Fireâ€™s Amila Aponso and Ansh Patel sought to snatch a comeback for their side. Aponso claimed two vital wickets, including Malek, putting breaks on the chase. Nonetheless, Mohsin's aggressive play sealed the win for the Royals. Baltimore achieved the target in 18.2 overs, scoring 142 for the loss of 5 wickets, thanks to their composed yet assertive approach in the latter part of their innings.
