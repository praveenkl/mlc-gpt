The Seattle Thunderbolts showcased an impressive performance as they comfortably defeated the East Bay Blazers by nine wickets in a Minor League Cricket showdown on September 15, 2024.

Winning the toss and electing to bat first, the East Bay Blazers had a shaky start, with wickets falling at regular intervals. Sujith Gowda was the first to depart, bowled by Atif Attarwala for 8 runs. This set the tone for a challenging innings where the Blazers struggled against a disciplined Seattle bowling attack. Vikash Mohan managed only 7 runs before being caught off Sujit Nayak's bowling, and despite a brief resistance from Usman Ghani, who scored a brisk 18 runs from 13 balls, the team lost momentum with wickets tumbling around him.

Adithya Ganesh tried to steady the innings with a patient 21 off 25 balls, but it was too slow to change the game’s complexion. Middle-order batsman Abhishek Paradkar showed some intent, crafting a spirited 20 from 16 balls, but it wasn’t enough to lift the Blazers to a competitive total. Atif Attarwala emerged as the standout bowler for the Thunderbolts, claiming four crucial wickets for just 12 runs in his four-over spell. Shivam Sharma also made significant contributions with the ball, picking up two wickets for 15 runs. Ultimately, the Blazers were bowled out for a modest 99 runs in 19.1 overs.

In response, the Seattle Thunderbolts chased down the target in dominant style. Opening batsmen Ruben Clinton and Ian Chauhan forged a robust partnership, setting the platform for an easy chase. Clinton anchored the innings with a steady 47 off 47 deliveries, hitting four boundaries and two sixes. His partner Ian Chauhan played a more aggressive role, scoring a swift 44 from 30 balls, including eight fours, before being the only wicket to fall, caught off Vikash Mohan's bowling.

Seattle's batting depth was barely tested as Abinav Sudershan came in and sealed the win with a quick 5 runs, taking Seattle over the line with plenty of overs to spare. The Thunderbolts reached their target in just 13.4 overs, highlighting their dominance with the bat. The East Bay Blazers' bowling attack, led by Rushil Ugarkar and Carmi Le Roux, failed to make significant inroads, and the solitary success of Vikash Mohan was too little, too late.

Overall, it was a comprehensive all-round performance by Seattle Thunderbolts, who left their mark with disciplined bowling and aggressive batting, securing a commanding nine-wicket victory over the East Bay Blazers.
