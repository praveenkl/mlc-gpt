In what was expected to be an exciting encounter in the Minor League Cricket tournament, the match between Lone Star Athletics and the Dallas Xforia Giants was unfortunately abandoned due to unforeseen circumstances. The match, scheduled to take place on the 2nd of September, 2024, in the Central division, ended without a ball being bowled.

Both teams were eager to showcase their skills on the field, but as the day progressed, it became evident that the conditions were not conducive for play. As a result, no batting or bowling statistics were recorded for either team.
