In an enthralling encounter in the Minor League Cricket (MiLC) tournament, the San Diego Surf Riders emerged victorious over the Golden State Grizzlies with a winning margin of 7 wickets. The match, held on September 13, 2024, saw the Surf Riders skillfully chase down the target set by the Grizzlies.

The Golden State Grizzlies, after winning the toss, opted to bat first and compiled a competitive total of 176 runs for the loss of 5 wickets in their allotted 20 overs. The innings was built around solid batting performances, particularly by Kranthi Kumar, who struck a belligerent 56 runs off 34 balls, exhibiting tremendous power with 4 sixes and 2 boundaries. His innings was well-complemented by Tarun Adada, scoring a brisk 47 runs off 35 balls, hitting 4 boundaries and 4 sixes. Despite these strong contributions, the Grizzlies struggled to accelerate towards the end, largely due to tight bowling from the Surf Riders, particularly Gayan Fernando, who claimed a wicket and bowled economically, conceding only 29 runs in his full quota of 4 overs.

In response, the San Diego Surf Riders chased down the target with elegance and power, scoring 177 runs in 18 overs. Despite an early wobble, losing Ruvindu Gunasekera for 7 and Nikhil Dutta for a duck within the initial overs, the Surf Riders recovered quickly thanks to the efforts of Skanda Rohit Sharma and Abheyender Singh. Sharma anchored the innings with a composed 60 runs off 45 balls, supported by 5 fours and 2 sixes, showcasing a balance of aggression and precision. Umar Akmal further accelerated the run chase with a rapid 44 off just 26 balls, embellished with 7 fours and 2 sixes, but it was Singh who played the match-winning knock. Singh hammered an unbeaten 53 from a mere 29 deliveries, displaying exemplary power hitting with 7 boundaries and 2 towering sixes, sealing the victory for his team.

Adnesh Tondale was the pick of the bowlers for the Grizzlies, claiming 2 wickets for 20 runs in his 3 overs but lacked support from the other end. The Grizzlies' bowling, filled with wides, proved costly, contributing to their downfall in defending the total.

This commanding victory by the San Diego Surf Riders, achieved with 12 balls to spare, reflects their depth in batting and strategic prowess, showcasing their potential as serious contenders in the MiLC tournament. The Golden State Grizzlies, while showing promise with the bat, will look to refine their bowling and fielding efforts in their subsequent matches.
