In an exhilarating encounter of the Minor League Cricket tournament, the East Bay Blazers came out victorious against the Seattle Thunderbolts, securing a win by 25 runs. The match, held on September 13, 2024, witnessed a display of exceptional cricket skills and strategic gameplay by both teams.

Winning the toss, East Bay Blazers chose to bat first. Although they had a shaky start with openers Saideep Ganesh and Usman Ghani falling early to the quick and effective bowling from Seattle Thunderbolts’ star, Abhijai Mansingh, the Blazers found their footing through a remarkable innings by Sujith Gowda. Gowda played a sublime knock, scoring a robust 94 off 58 balls, peppered with 11 boundaries and 4 sixes, ensuring his team reached a competitive total. Despite a middle-order collapse, with Adithya Ganesh and Suliman Arabzai unable to capitalize on the platform, the Blazers managed to muster 162 for 9 in their allotted 20 overs.

Seattle Thunderbolts’ bowling effort was highlighted by the impressive spell from Mansingh, who captured 4 crucial wickets for 29 runs in his 4 overs, stifling the Blazers' scoring rate. Atif Attarwala also contributed effectively, bowling tight lines to pick up a wicket while controlling his economy. Despite Blazers losing wickets at regular intervals, Sujith Gowda’s bat spoke volumes as he anchored the innings with great tenacity.

Chasing a target of 163, Seattle Thunderbolts’ innings struggled to gain momentum. The Thunderbolts stuttered early on, with Rushil Ugarkar delivering a match-turning bowling spell, clinching 3 wickets for just 14 runs in his 4-over spell. He was well-supported by Vikash Mohan, who impressed with a couple of key breakthroughs alongside the economical bowling of Carmi Le Roux and Kristopher Ramsaran, each taking a wicket to tighten the noose around the Thunderbolts’ chase.

Ruben Clinton top-scored for the Thunderbolts with 43 off 44 balls, but his efforts could not muster the required support from the middle order, as the Thunderbolts found themselves continually falling behind the asking rate. Despite resistance from tail-enders Rishab Mohan, who hit 24 quick runs, and Atif Attarwala’s contribution, the Thunderbolts managed to reach only 137 for 7 at the end of their innings, falling short of the target.

The East Bay Blazers’ complete team effort, spearheaded by a laudable batting masterclass from Sujith Gowda and Rushil Ugarkar’s exceptional bowling performance, secured them a well-deserved win. The victory not only showcased the Blazers' depth but also propelled them favorably on the league table, emphasizing their potential as strong contenders in the tournament.
