Major League Cricket is concluding its 21-match season, with a thrilling four-team playoff to determine the champion. Despite having six teams across the country, all matches are being held in dedicated cricket grounds in Texas and North Carolina. The league has seen impressive attendance, on track to surpass the 70,000 fans who attended the inaugural season in 2023.

To attract a broader audience, the league has secured a media rights arrangement with Cricbuzz's Willow, a specialist cricket channel, which has partnered with regional sports networks in each team's local market.

The league operates within a salary cap of $1.15 million per team, which is competitive with other global leagues such as Cricket Australia and The Hundred in the UK. The quality of play has attracted high-profile players, including Australian national team captain Pat Cummins, who signed a four-year contract with the San Francisco Unicorns.

The league has ambitious plans for expansion, aiming to establish stadiums in each team's market and expand the schedule to 34 games by 2025, with the intention of increasing the number of franchises to 10.
