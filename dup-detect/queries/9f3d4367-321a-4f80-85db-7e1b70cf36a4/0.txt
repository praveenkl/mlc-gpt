* MLC is expanding rapidly, with plans to nearly double the number of games from 19 to around 38 by 2025.
* The tournament is growing in recognition, with the International Cricket Council (ICC) considering MLC matches as official games, attracting better players and more attention.
* The league currently has six teams, four of which are owned by the owners of prominent Indian Premier League teams (Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, and Delhi Capitals).
* MLC's success may pose a threat to English cricket, as their proposed June start date overlaps with England's T20 Blast competition, potentially luring English players with higher pay and prestige.
* MLC's growth may accelerate England's consideration of private investment in their own Hundred tournament, similar to MLC's model.

Overall, MLC's expansion is good news for cricket fans in the US, but may create challenges for English cricket in the long run.
