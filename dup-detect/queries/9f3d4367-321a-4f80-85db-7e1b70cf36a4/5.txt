**Season 2 of MLC**: The second season of MLC has kicked off with a rematch between MI New York and Seattle Orcas, following a successful first season that exceeded financial targets with revenues of $8 million.

**Expanding Reach**: The tournament has secured major sponsorship deals, including a title sponsorship with Cognizant, and has received official T20 league status, with tournament playing records counted towards format statistics.

**Player Contracts**: Top players will earn around $175,000 for a minimum of five games, rivaling figures in other T20 leagues outside of the Indian Premier League. Stars from Australia, including Pat Cummins, will participate in this season's MLC.

**Future Plans**: There are plans to expand MLC, with Chicago and Atlanta touted as possible new franchises, and a longer tournament earmarked to be played over much of June and July in the future.

**Challenges**: Despite the progress, MLC faces challenges, including governance issues with USA Cricket, the sport's governing body in the US.

**Fanbase**: MLC has an invested fanbase, with cricket broadcaster Willow reaching around 4-5 million homes, translating to a fanbase of around 10 million people. The tournament hopes to ride the momentum generated by the recent T20 World Cup.
