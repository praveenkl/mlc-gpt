**Recognition**: MLC has acquired List A status from the ICC, making it an official T20 league, and tournament playing records will now be counted as official format statistics.

**2024 Season**: The 2024 edition of MLC will start on July 5 and will feature 25 games. The tournament will be played across two grounds: Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.

**Expansion Plans**: MLC plans to expand from six teams to 10 teams over the next few years, with the goal of hosting 34 games by 2025.

**Schedule**: The ideal calendar for MLC is to start in early June, avoiding clashes with the Hundred and T20 Blast. However, this year's schedule will overlap with the Hundred, with the MLC ending on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23.

**Teams and Ownership**: Four of the six teams in the MLC are owned by IPL team owners, including Mumbai Indians, KKR, Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals.
