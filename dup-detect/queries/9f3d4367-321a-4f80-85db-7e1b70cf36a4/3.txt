**Launch and Investors**: The MLC was launched in 2022 with an investment of $120 million from investors including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Shah Rukh Khan, and others.

**First Season**: The first season of MLC was played in July 2023 with 6 teams, all owned by Indian investors. The season consisted of 15 group-stage matches and 4 playoff matches, with MI New York winning the title. Nicholas Pooran was the highest run-scorer, and Trent Boult took the highest number of wickets.

**Upcoming Second Season**: The second season of MLC will start on July 6, with 21 group-stage matches and 7 matches per team. The matches will be played in two stadiums, and the timing will be adjusted to attract more fans.

**Challenges**: MLC faces challenges in competing with the Indian Premier League (IPL), with a significant difference in brand value and player salaries. To succeed, MLC needs to improve the quality of American players.

**International Recognition**: The International Cricket Council approved List-A status for MLC, allowing player and team statistics to be counted in T20 records.

**Future Plans**: The MLC plans to increase the number of matches to 34 by 2025 and eventually become a 10-team tournament, a first for any franchise tournament outside of the IPL.
