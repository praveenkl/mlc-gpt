* The MLC has been awarded List A status by the International Cricket Council (ICC), making it the second T20 league run by an Associate nation to receive this status.
* The List A status recognizes the MLC as an official T20 league and America's first world-class domestic tournament.
* This development will allow MLC players' performances to be documented as official career statistics, providing opportunities for local US players to gain international recognition.
* The MLC's second season is set to begin on July 5, with plans to expand from a 19-game season to a 34-game season by 2025.
* Tickets for the season are available online, with general admission tickets starting at $30 per person, and fans can expect entertainment, fireworks, giveaways, and other activities beyond the cricket matches.
