**List A Status:** The MLC has been awarded List A status by the International Cricket Council (ICC), recognizing it as an official T20 league, and allowing player performances to count towards their official career statistics.

**Expansion Plans:** The MLC plans to expand from 6 teams to 10 teams over the next few years, with an increase in matches from 19 to 34 by 2025.

**Scheduling:** The league aims to start in early June, coinciding with the end of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and US school holidays, but may face scheduling conflicts with the English T20 Blast competition.

**Scheduling Conflicts:** There will be a 6-day overlap with the Hundred, a rival T20 league, which may impact the availability of overseas players participating in both leagues.

**IPL Backing:** Four of the six MLC franchises are owned by established IPL teams, providing a solid foundation for growth and development.

**Upcoming Season:** The second season of MLC will be played at the same two venues as the inaugural season - Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.
