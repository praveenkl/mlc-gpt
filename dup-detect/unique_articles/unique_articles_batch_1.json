With this new status, every century, half-century, run-out, win, loss, and championship will be officially documented in an internationally recognized format of the game.\n\nThe CEO of MLC, Vijay Srinivasan, recently announced plans to expand the tournament from 19 games in 2023 to 34 by 2025.

This means official player statistics from the MLC will now be recognized alongside other major T20 leagues worldwide.\n\nRecognition for Growing Tournament\n\n“We are really excited for the news,” said tournament director Justin Geale. This recognition from the ICC validates the quality of players and the high standard of competition in the MLC.\n\nThis status boost will not only enhance the credibility of cricket in the USA but also ensures “the performances of some of the world’s best players are adequately reflected in their career statistics,” Geale added.\n\nExpansion and scheduling ambitions of MLC\n\nThe upcoming season, kicking off on July 5th, will see the MLC expand its footprint. Plans are in place to grow from the current six teams to ten over the next few years, with a corresponding increase in matches from 19 to 34 by 2025.\n\nMLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan also revealed their ideal calendar would involve an earlier June start, potentially capitalizing on the American school holidays and avoiding clashes with other major leagues. However, this could lead to some overlap with England’s T20 Blast.\n\nAlarm bells for ECB, CA\n\nWith several MLC teams owned by IPL franchises, there’s a chance of player overlap with England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) owned The Hundred, another T20 league starting in late July. As many as half of the Hundred’s overseas players might arrive late due to their MLC commitments.\n\nThe Cricket Australia (CA) will also be looking at this development regarding MLC with sharp eyes as USA’s T20 league will be direct competitor of CA’s Big Bash League (BBL) in future.\n\nBright Future for cricket in USA\n\nDespite these potential scheduling hurdles, the MLC’s List A status and ambitious expansion plans are positive signs for the growth of cricket in the USA. The upcoming season promises more high-quality cricket and paves the way for a more established American T20 league in the years to come.",

    "title": "Ricky Ponting on cusp of landing major coaching role amid genius cricket commentary",
    "date": "Thu Feb  1 03:23:52 2024",
    "body": "Ricky Ponting has forged a reputation as one of the most astute minds in world cricket and now the Aussie legend could be taking that knowledge with him to the United States. The former Aussie captain has confirmed he is in talks to coach the Washington Freedom in America's Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nThe United States launched its first major foray into the world of cricket with the introduction of the MLC in 2023 - a T20 competition comprised of six teams from a number of America's biggest cities. MI New York were crowned inaugural champions after defeating the Seattle Orcas in the championship final, with the majority of the matches played in front of sold-out stadiums in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nOH NO: Will Pucovski ruled out of Sheffield Shield game amid fresh blow\n\nBRUTAL: Michael Clarke mocked in savage moment at Aussie cricket awards\n\nNOT GOOD: Ellyse Perry and Nathan Lyon dudded amid Mitch Marsh triumph\n\nThe US-based competition is part of the ICC's push for cricket's expansion into the lucrative North American market, and Ponting's inclusion would be a massive boon for both the MLC and the sport. The legendary former Australian captain is deciding whether he can commit to both the MLC and commentary duties for the T20 World Cup, which will be held in North America in June.\n\nRicky Ponting confirms talks with Washington Freedom\n\nThe second edition of MLC will begin just four days after the World Cup final is played in Barbados on June 30. \"We're not there yet, I haven't committed to anything just yet, but I've had some initial discussions (with Washington),\" Ponting told SEN radio on Thursday.\n\n\"The time of the year sort of fits in OK for me, but I've got a really hectic off-season again. When I say off-season, there's no such thing as an off-season for cricketers anymore.\"\n\nPonting is currently head coach of the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the head of strategy for Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League (BBL) and one of the chief commentators on the Seven Network's free-to-air cricket coverage in Australia. \"It's potentially another big year of time away if I want it, so there are things I've got to work through,\" Ponting said. \"If I'm actually going to be commentating the T20 World Cup or not and if I'm not doing that, where does MLC fit in?\"\n\nPonting would be a tremendous addition to a Washington Freedom side that made it to the MLC eliminator final last year, with his knowledge of the game and tactical awareness among the best in the sport. Not to mention the commercial and public relations possibilities that come with having one of the game's greatest ever players attached to the competition.\n\nIndia's influence in the fledgling US-based competition is evidenced by the fact three out of the six teams share part of their names with IPL franchises. Aussie states have also shown a willingness to form strategic partnerships with the US teams, with Cricket Victoria aligning itself with the San Francisco Unicorns and Queensland Cricket announcing a collaboration with the Seattle Orcas.\n\nCricket NSW also share a partnership with the Washington Freedom, with Greg Shipperd central to the relationship between the two parties. The Aussie coach led the Washington side in its inaugural season and recently took over as the NSW state coach, having managed the Sydney Sixers since 2015 in the BBL.\n\nIf Ponting is named as Shipperd's successor at Washington, he would become the latest big name in Aussie cricket to join the MLC. Aussie ODI World Cup winners Marcus Stoinis and Adam Zampa, as well as white-ball stars Matthew Wade and Aaron Finch were all part of the MLC's inaugural season.\n\nRicky Ponting's cricket brain continues to amaze\n\nWashington would no doubt be hoping that Ponting could bring some of the cricketing genius that he continues to showcase in his commentary role for Seven. Ponting's commentary predictions have become legendary in recent years, with the 168-Test legend showing why he's regarded as the smartest man in cricket during Australia's Test series against the West Indies.\n\nPonting successfully called Alex Carey's downfall on day two of the Windies' historic Gabba Test win in Brisbane. It came as Usman Khawaja and Carey were left to try and rescue Australia's innings after a top order collapse against the underdogs. Khawaja and Carey combined for a 65-run partnership to steady the ship for Australia, but Ponting noticed Carey was starting to become frustrated with his own scoring rate.\n\n\"It looks like his eyes are spinning. He is in overdrive and wants to hit every ball,\" Ponting said. \"I agree with you Bish (West Indies great Ian Bishop), just go a bit more defensive and make him play a big shot from a good length ball.\" As Ponting finished his tactical analysis, Shamar Joseph charged in and delivered a ball at Carey's chest.\n\nCarey mistimed a pull shot and the ball went directly to the West Indies fielder. Once again Ponting had a premonition about a wicket after also displaying his clairvoyant powers 24 hours earlier. On that occasion, Ponting suggested the West Indies batting duo should rotate the strike at the end of day one or risk losing a late wicket.\n\nThat same over, Alzarri Joseph was dismissed on the final ball of the day after Kevin Sinclair had refused a single. The two examples were just the latest in a growing list of brilliant calls from Ponting, whose ability to predict what's about to happen in a cricket match is becoming legendary.",
    "summary": "* The MLC is a T20 competition in the United States that was launched in 2023 with six teams from major American cities.\n* The inaugural season's champion was MI New York, who defeated the Seattle Orcas in the championship final.\n* The competition is part of the ICC's effort to expand cricket into the North American market.\n* Ricky Ponting, a former Australian captain, is in talks to coach the Washington Freedom, one of the MLC teams.\n* Ponting's addition would be a significant boost to the MLC and cricket in general, given his tactical awareness and knowledge of the game.\n* The second edition of the MLC is set to begin just four days after the T20 World Cup final in June.\n* Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises have influenced the naming of three MLC teams, while Australian states have formed partnerships with US teams, such as Cricket NSW with the Washington Freedom.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify or expand on any of these points!",

Jolly shame!\"\n\nWhile other cricketers in the league have also expressed concerns over having to \"rush the game,\" preliminary polls of the three or four people who actually watch cricket have shown that the change is quite popular.\n\n\"It makes it much easier to watch cricket now that I don't have to take two weeks' vacation every time I want to catch a game,\" said Robert Brown, avid fan of the New Delhi BumblyBowlers. \"I have so much more time now to do other things, like eat and see my family. It was sorely needed.\"\n\nAt publishing time, the innovation had succeeded in bringing the length of MLC cricket matches down to a record 7 days, 4 hours, and 37 minutes.\n\nWant proof that Jesus was a woke socialist?

    "date": "Fri Jul 12 02:31:00 2024",
    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nAfter finishing rock-bottom of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in 2023, the Los Angeles Knight Riders began this season well with a victory but now come into this one on the back of back-to-back defeats. The San Francisco Unicorns have picked up one win with one defeat in their opening two matches ahead of this clash in North Carolina.\n\nDATE & TIME: Saturday 13th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:00pm / USA PT – 12:00pm / West Indies – 2:00pm / UK – 8:00pm / South Africa – 9:00pm / Sunday 14th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:00am / India – 12:30am / Bangladesh – 1:00am / Australia – 5:00am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 32c o 89.6 F with rain forecast at the start of the match\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: THE SHODDY LAKR\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders began the 2024 Major League Cricket season with an impressive defence of what seemed to be a fairly small total when the Texas Super Kings fell 12 runs short of LAKR’s 162-7. Since then, though, they could not defend 165-6 against the San Francisco Unicorns and then also suffered a nine-wicket thumping to last season’s runners’ up, the Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWL\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: BOUNCING BACK\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns began their season with that aforementioned victory over LAKR in Dallas. Finn Allen led the way with 63 runs from 37 balls as they reached 166-4 in just 15.2 overs last week. In their second match of the tournament, they were skittled for just 127 by an experienced Texas Super Kings side before giving up the target in just 12.5 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: LWLLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nEven in victory, the Los Angeles Knight Riders simply haven’t scored enough runs. 162 shouldn’t have been enough to beat TSK and the two targets they have set since have been well below par. What did happen in their second game, though, was South African David Miller coming to the party with an unbeaten 44 at a strike rate of 200 and the thrilling middle-order bat is likely to be their top scorer if their misfiring top order get out early enough.\n\nWith the ball, they have a fair bit of variation with the likes of Ali Khan, Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan and Sunil Narine. However, they are heavily reliant on Aussie quick Spencer Johnson for wickets. The Unicorns go hard and should lose wickets so Johnson to take two or more poles would appear a good bet for that reason.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWith a top order that consists of the aforementioned Finn Allen as well as Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Short and Josh Inglis; the San Francisco Unicorns have the potential to do exactly what they have shown in their opening two matches; collapse in a heap or go hard and get a big score in no time. Short is the man in the best nick at the moment so him to score 30+ at another decent strike rate would be a worthy shout.\n\nIn the bowling department, the Unicorns have the experience of former England international Liam Plunkett but beyond that they are perhaps a bit blunt for the shortest format of the game with the consistently flattering to deceive Haris Rauf and more suited to Test match bowling of Abrar Ahmed. Plunkett remains their best chance of wickets outside of the powerplay so Plunkett to be their top bowler remains the best bet for this.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThis is a confusing one to predict a winner in because of the strengths and weakness of both sides. LAKR have the edge with the ball, whilst the Unicorns are certainly the more modern day and aggressive of the two sides with the bat. That said, if the top four of San Francisco, albeit Inglis dropped to five against TSK, can fire then they can easily overwhelm any team in the competition – and LAKR’s best bet, of experience with the ball, is still relatively weak. As a result, the Unicorns will be confident of doing the double over their opposition.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom beat Seattle Orcas by 5 wickets, in Match 8 of the Major League Cricket 2024, at Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas today.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom, Match 8\n\nSeattle Orcas 124/10 (19.4 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom 127/5 (18.2 ov)\n\nResult - Washington Freedom won by 5 wickets\n\nSCORECARD\n\nManhattan\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nWashington Freedom edged out Seattle Orcas by five wickets in a tense low-scoring match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas on Thursday.\n\nLockie Ferguson (4/26) and Saurabh Netravalkar (3/18) shared seven wickets to bundle out Seattle Orcas to 124 in 19.4 overs. Lahiru Milantha (33 off 30) and Obus Pienaar (25 off 28) then anchored a crucial unbeaten 63-run partnership to guide Washington Freedom past their 125-run target with 10 balls to spare.\n\nWith this win, Washington Freedom moved to the top of the points table with 5 points from three matches, remaining the only unbeaten team in the tournament thus far.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas came out firing to defend a low total of 125 runs. Imad Wasim removed the dangerous Travis Head for a duck on the second ball of the innings, ending the over with a wicket maiden. Steve Smith and Rachin Ravindra then looked to rebuild with the counter-attack. They scored as many as 18 runs in the third over. Ravindra looked dangerous with the bat, but Nandre Burger dismissed him in the fifth over for 26 off 16 balls, which included three boundaries and two sixes. Smith (12 off 13) followed him back to the pavilion in the following over, leaving the Orcas at 47/3 after six overs.\n\nBoth Mukhtar Ahmed and Glenn Maxwell were given lifelines with dropped catches but couldn't capitalise on them. Ahmed (8 off 8) was dismissed by Burger in the eighth over, and Maxwell (10 off 11) fell to Harmeet, leaving their team struggling at 68/5 after 10 overs.\n\nDespite the dire situation, Washington Freedom batters Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar showed resilience as they cautiously approached the target. They helped Washington reach the 100-run mark in the 16th over, reducing the equation to 23 runs needed off 24 balls. Milantha (33* off 30) and Pienaar (31* off 30) constructed a match-winning partnership to help their side get past the winning line.\n\nEarlier in the contest, the Seattle Orcas had a shaky start to their innings. Nauman Anwar was dismissed cheaply for 3 off 9 balls by Saurabh Netravalkar in the second over. The Seattle batters struggled to accelerate on the slow batting track, managing only 35 runs in the Powerplay. Ryan Rickelton also fell for 4 off 11 balls to Lockie Ferguson in the sixth over.\n\nQuinton de Kock (24 off 19) failed to build on his start and was bowled by Ferguson in the eighth over, with Seattle struggling at 44/3 after eight overs.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen and Shubham Ranjane carefully constructed a crucial partnership that steadied Seattle's innings. However, Ranjane (12 off 17) was unfortunately run out on the first ball of the 14th over. Klaasen, batting as if on a different surface, completed his fifty in just 29 balls but was immediately caught by Mukhtar Ahmed at long-off off Marco Jansen in the 15th over. His crucial innings, which included four fours and three sixes, helped Seattle cross the 100-run mark in the 15th over.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington bowlers didn't allow the following batters to score big. Ferguson took two wickets in the 17th over, finishing his spell with four wickets. He removed Imad Wasim (4 off 6) and Hammad Azam (4 off 9) in his last over. Netravalkar then dismissed Harmeet Singh (2 off 3) in the following over, leaving Seattle struggling at 112/8 after 18 overs.\n\nSeattle managed to get nine runs in the penultimate over as Cameron Gannon (8 off 5) attempted to hit the ball as hard as possible. He struck a maximum, but was dismissed on his second attempt, as he got caught by Ferguson at long-off off Ian Holland's bowling. Netravalkar then removed Nandre Burger (3 off 6), thus bowling out the Orcas for 124 in 19.4 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-6 (Nauman Anwar - 1.6 ov), 2-34 (Ryan Rickelton - 5.5 ov), 3-44 (Quinton de Kock - 7.5 ov), 4-81 (Shubham Ranjane - 13.1 ov), 5-102 (Heinrich Klaasen - 14.3 ov), 6-107 (Imad Wasim - 16.2 ov), 7-110 (Hammad Azam - 16.6 ov), 8-112 (Harmeet Singh - 17.3 ov), 9-120 (Cameron Gannon - 18.5 ov), 10-124 (Nandre Burger - 19.4 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-0 (Travis Head - 0.2 ov), 2-34 (Rachin Ravindra - 4.2 ov), 3-43 (Steven Smith - 5.5 ov), 4-53 (Mukhtar Ahmed - 6.5 ov), 5-64 (Glenn Maxwell - 9.1 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nRyan Rickelton\n\nNauman Anwar\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nHammad Azam\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nImad Wasim\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nNandre Burger\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nZaman Khan\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nTravis Head\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nLahiru Milantha(WK)\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nIan Holland\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Friday, July 12, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas",

The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the MI New York at Church Street Park in Morrisville. That game will be played on July 13th and will start at 12.30 am IST (7.00 pm GMT, the previous day). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nSteve Smith, the Washington Freedom skipper, says that it was a hard-fought game. Adds that the top order did not great start but Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar played smart cricket and got the job done. Shares that it was a slow and low wicket and all the bowlers did a good job. Mentions that they had a few hiccups with the bat but glad to be on the winning front. Reckons that the wicket got a tad slow so it was important to cash on the powerplay and would have been easy if someone from the top order had made a 50-60 but he's happy that the middle and lower order got their chance and they came out victorious.\n\nThe losing skipper of Seattle Orcas, Heinrich Klaasen says they lost the game in the last four overs with the bat as they couldn't add a lot to the total and left with a below-par score. Adds that they are lacking that one guy in the last few overs who could give them the perfect balance with both bat and ball to finish things well. Mentions that they needed to pick up wickets early on and they did that as well but they were good 15-20 runs shot at the end with the bat. Closes by saying the pitch was good and had they been at 140-145 by the end of their innings, the result could have been different.\n\nLockie Ferguson is the Player of the Match for his stellar spell. He says that it’s a good start to the campaign and nice to get in full 40 overs. Adds that as a group, it’s been great. Mentions that he tried bowling in good areas and it worked well for them. Ends by sharing that Heinrich Klaasen was looking dangerous and he's that they got his wicket.\n\nRachin Ravindra is up for a chat. He says it wasn't easy in the middle to bat but it was easier to bat while the ball was new. Adds that Imad Wasim bowled a maiden first up but him being a left-hander was a match-up for him and the support staff backed him for taking it on and it worked for him. Mentions that they look to stick to their plans and today despite the fall of wickets they kept playing their brand of cricket and eventually won.\n\nEarlier today, Seattle Orcas were asked to bat first and they made a below-par score of 124 with only Heinrich Klaasen making an attacking fifty while the rest of the batting struggled. Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar accounted for seven wickets between them and broke the back of Seattle Orcas' batting. Seattle Orcas are stranded at the bottom of the table while Washington Freedom moves to the top position. It's still early days in the season but teams will want to make winning a habit.\n\nSeattle Orcas did not have a huge score to defend but they started well by picking an early wicket. They gave away a few freebies through the powerplay but came back strong to put a dent in the Washington Freedom batting. Nandre Burger was the pick of the bowlers taking 2 for 26 while Harmeet Singh, Imad Wasim, and Cameron Gannon chipped in with one apiece and kept it tight. Seattle Orcas have suffered their second loss of the season and will want to turnaround their campaign quickly.\n\nA hard-fought run chase from the Washington Freedom takes them to the top of the table and they are unbeaten in the season so far. Chasing a tricky score of 125 for the win, the Freedom lost Travis Head for a duck but Smith and Ravindra stuck a few boundaries and got their side to a decent start in the powerplay. The Seattle Orcas came back strongly and reduced the Freedom to 64 for 5 with all their big guns back in the hut. Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar joined hands and added an unbeaten 63-run stand to steer their side home. Lahiru Milantha made a steady 33 off 30 while Obus Pienaar chipped in with 31 crucial runs. Washington Freedom are the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far and will hope to keep it going.\n\nStrategic Break! Washington Freedom needs 32 off the final five overs. They are ahead in the game but the Seattle Orcas are giving it a real fight. A couple of wickets here would tilt the tide in favor of the Orcas. Washington Freedom will hope for Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar to carry on and take their side home to get two more points on the board.",

They bowled well to restrict LAKR to 165 runs total before Finn Allen went ballistic in the chase.\n\nHe scored 63 off 27 deliveries to ensure the Unicorns are off to a flyer start. Moreover, Matthew Short's fiery contribution of 58 (26) steered Unicorns to a successful run chase with four overs left.\n\nOverall, it was a complete performance from both the departments and hence ahead of the upcoming game against Texas, the Unicorns will count themselves as favourites.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nOn the other hand, Texas Super Kings are struggling to find their footing into the MLC 2024 edition. After losing a close game to LAKR in the tournament opener, Texas were saved by rain gods in the following game against Washington Freedom.\n\nSkipper Faf du Plessis' century resulted in 203 runs in the first innings total for Texas, and it appeared good enough until Travis Head and Steve Smith unleashed carnage in the powerplay.\n\nHead's 32 (12) and Smith's 26 (13) blistering knocks steered Washington to 64 runs on board in just the first four overs before rain interrupted play. Due to a weak drainage system, the game couldn't resume and both teams were awarded a point each.\n\nHowever, it's safe to say, had the game resumed, Washington would have walked all over Texas in no time. Hence, the Super Kings will remain under a lot of pressure against the Unicorns.\n\nSFU vs TEX: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSFU vs TEX: Church Street Park Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at Church Street Park generally provides a fair contest between bat and ball.

Hence, such instances need to be avoided by Seattle in the future.\n\nWashington Freedom is a formidable side and will ask the right questions. Hence, Heinrich Klaasen and Co must stay vigilant and step up as a unit to advance against Washington.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nOn the other hand, Washington Freedom have been unlucky as their second game got washed out due to rain. Even in the tournament opener, they dodged a bullet with the results turning in their favour after the DLS method was enforced.\n\nChasing 155 runs against MI New York, Steve Smith stamped his authority with 46 off 28 runs knock, and before rain halted the game, Washington had 55 runs on board at the loss of one wicket. They were four runs ahead as per DLS calculations and were awarded two points for the game.\n\nWashington Freedom have potentially the most fierce and balanced unit at their helm this tournament. Travis Head and Smith are in the form of their lives whereas Glenn Maxwell, Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar have also raised the standards.\n\nHence, it's safe to say that Washington Freedom will be the team to beat this MLC 2024 edition.\n\nSEA vs WAS: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSEA vs WAS: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at Grand Prairie Stadium has offered even assistance to both the batting and bowling departments. Bowlers who can maintain a good line and length and utilise the bounce effectively can trouble the batters. Spinners come into play as the pitch starts to wear down.

After winning their opening game over Texas Super Kings, the Sunil Narine-led side is on a two-match losing streak, suffering defeats against Unicorns and Seattle Orcas, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, Corey Anderson-led side is just below Knight Riders and holds the fifth position in the points table. The side started their campaign on a high note, registering a six-wicket win over the same opponents. But in their previous game against Super Kings, the San Francisco-based franchise faced a batting collapse which eventually resulted in them ending on the losing side.\n\nMatch Details\n\nPitch Report\n\nThe surface at Morrisville appears to be consistent, maintaining its characteristics for the full 20-over game. However, a notable issue is the decreasing strike rate of batters in the second innings, as the ball loses pace off the surface. This allows bowlers to exploit the inconsistent bounce, suggesting teams should set moderate, achievable targets rather than aiming for exceptionally high scores. However, the team that wins the toss will look to bowl first.\n\nHead-to-Head Record\n\nProbable Playing 11 for LAS vs SF, Match 10\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine(C), Unmukt Chand (WK), Shakib Al Hasan, Nitish Kumar, David Miller, Andre Russell, Derone Davis, Corne Dry, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short, Josh Inglis(WK), Corey Anderson(C), Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Hassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nAlso Check:\n\nProbable Top Performers from LAS vs SF\n\nProbable Best Batter of the match:\n\nJason Roy could be the best batter in the upcoming match against the San Francisco-based franchise. The English opener who is not a regular member of the Three Lions has been featuring in most of the franchise-based leagues all around the world. For San Francisco, Roy has been exceptional with his bat and has scored 97 runs in three innings. With his form, he can trouble the opposition bowlers and take his team to a comfortable position single-handedly.\n\nProbable Best Bowler of the match:\n\nSpencer Johnson could be the best bowler in the forthcoming game. The left-arm pacer has been among the wickets since the first game and is currently the second-highest wicket-taker with six wickets under his name. With the pitch favouring more to the bowlers, Johnson will be a key player.\n\nToday’s Match Prediction: The team that bowls first to win the match\n\nScenario 1\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 40-50\n\nFirst Innings Score: 140-150\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders win the match\n\nScenario 2\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 30-40\n\nFirst Innings Score: 130-140\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns win the match",

Nauman Anwar added a quickfire 9 runs from 7 balls, adding to the team’s total with valuable contributions down the order.\n\nOn the bowling front, Zaman Khan was instrumental for the Orcas, delivering an impressive spell to claim 2 wickets for just 24 runs in his 4 overs. His ability to strike crucial blows halted the Knight Riders’ momentum during their innings.

Santner got under the tossed-up delivery outside off stump and unleashed a monstrous shot that sailed high and long, clearing the boundary by a considerable margin. The ball travelled an astonishing 106 metres, leaving the crowd in awe and the San Francisco fielders in disbelief.\n\n“That six from Santner was an absolute beast,” commented one of the commentators. “He just got under that delivery and sent it into the stratosphere.

    "body": "Our Major League Cricket 2024 campaign starts with a mouth-watering clash against defending champions MI New York at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, on July 6.\n\nSteve Smith joins our side with a host of exciting players this season and will lead us in the second edition of MLC. Along with Smith, the Australian duo of Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell are also on board and will strengthen our batting.\n\nTravis Head had an excellent outing in the T20 World Cup 2024, finishing as the highest run-getter for Australia and the third-highest overall. The Southpaw amassed 255 runs from seven matches at an excellent average of 42.50 and a strike rate of 158.38.\n\nNew Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra and pacer Lockie Ferguson also join the team, alongside home favorites Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar who held fort from last year.\n\nGous and Netravalkar finished as the highest run-getter and wicket-taker respectively for the USA in the recently concluded T20 World Cup, powering the co-host to the Super 8 stage in their first-ever World Cup.\n\nRicky Ponting will be our Head Coach for the MLC 2024 season as he takes over the reins from last year’s coach Greg Shipperd. Ponting will be assisted by former Australian batter Cameron White.\n\nWhat went down for Washington Freedom in MLC 2023?\n\nWe finished third in the MLC 2023 standings with six points from three wins and two losses in our group games. In the resulting Eliminator contest against MI New York, we fell short by 16 runs.\n\nMatthew Short was our top run-getter in the 2023 campaign with 152 runs from six outings. Saurabh Netravalkar topped our bowling charts, ranking fifth overall with 10 wickets from six matches, including breathtaking figures of 6/9 against the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nMLC 2024 Schedule: Washington Freedom matches\n\nUnlike the five league matches, one against each team, which all teams had in MLC 2023, the current edition will see teams play a total of seven league matches. We will face MI New York and Texas Super Kings twice each and play once against the remaining three teams. Here's a look at our schedule for MLC 2024.\n\nWashington Freedom Matches at MLC 2024\n\nMLC 2024: Washington Freedom squad\n\nOur team has progressed well from last year and grown into a stronger unit in the second season. The batting group has a wealth of experience, especially with the Australian trio of Head, Maxwell, and Smith.\n\nMukhtar Ahmed is a dangerous batter at the top of the order, averaging 28.77 in T20s with a healthy strike rate of 146.18.\n\nLahiru Milantha is the second wicketkeeper in the squad, along with Andries Gous. The left-handed Milantha is also a useful batter, averaging just under 25 with a strike rate of 136.58.\n\nGlenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, Marco Jansen, and Ian Holland are the all-rounders who provide the much-needed balance to the side. Holland averages 27.55 with the bat in T20s, and his handy medium pace provides a breakthrough every 22.6 balls.\n\nNetravalkar and Ferguson spearhead a pace attack that includes the experienced Andrew Tye. Tye has a tally of 332 wickets from 239 matches at an average of 21.15 and an unbelievable strike rate of 15.4.\n\nAkeal Hosein will headline the spin department. He will be the fourth left-arm spinner in the side, along with Ravindra, Obus Pienaar, and Amila Aponso.\n\nWashington Freedom Squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy Bodugum, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs MINY MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nThe LIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs MI New York match will be available on Monumental Sports Network in Washington D.C. and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA.

    "body": "Lockie Ferguson's splendid spell with the ball powered Washington Freedom to a five-wicket win against Seattle Orcas in their Major League Cricket 2024 match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday.\n\nPlayer of the Match, Ferguson registered match-winning figures of 4/26 in four overs to skittle out SO for 124, while Saurabh Netravalkar also impressed, picking up three wickets. SO skipper Heinrich Klaasen top-scored in the contest with 51 off 30 balls.\n\nIn response, Lahiru Milantha played a sensible innings to anchor our chase with an unbeaten 30-ball 33, as we reached 127/5 with more than an over remaining. Obus Pienaar also chipped in with an unbeaten 31 off 30 balls.\n\nNetravalkar justified skipper Steve Smith’s decision to bowl first by striking in his first over. Ferguson picked up a wicket in the powerplay, as SO managed 35/2 after the first six overs, with only 16 runs coming from boundaries.\n\nWe kept things tight even after the powerplay with Ferguson knocking Quinton de Kock for his second wicket of the match. Smith was in action as he ran out Shubham Ranjane with an excellent fielding effort to break a crucial partnership.\n\nMarco Jansen dismissed dangerman Heinrich Klaasen, who had just reached his half-century and looked in fine touch. Ferguson returned for a double strike in his final over to end his spell with four scalps and Seattle Orcas were all-out with two balls to spare.\n\nNetravalkar rose to the top of the bowling charts of MLC 2024, picking up his eighth wicket of the tournament. The left-arm pacer finished with an incisive spell of 3/18.\n\nChasing 125, Rachin Ravindra, playing his first match in the MLC, got us off to a quick start, hitting 26 off just 16 balls, which included two sixes and three fours. We reached 47 for the loss of three wickets at the end of the powerplay.\n\nFrom 64/5, Milantha and Pienaar put their heads down to build a crucial partnership to wrest the initiative back from SO. Their unbroken sixth-wicket partnership of 63 runs from 55 balls helped us cross the line as we remained the only team to be unbeaten in the MLC this year.\n\nWith the win, we moved to the top of the MLC 2024 points table with five points from three matches.\n\nWe will meet the Los Angeles Knight Riders in our next match at Church Street Park in Morrisville on Sunday.\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom MLC 2024 brief scores: SO 124 in 19.4 overs (Heinrich Klaasen 51, Quinton de Kock 24, Lockie Ferguson 4/26, Saurabh Netravalkar 3/18) vs WF 127/5 in 18.2 overs (Lahiru Milantha 33*, Obus Pienaar 31*, Nandre Burger 2/27, Harmeet Singh 1/15)\n\nWashington Freedom won by five wickets.",

    "date": "Mon Jul 22 17:22:59 2024",
    "body": "Programming note: The San Francisco Unicorns-Washington Freedom match airs Monday at 5:30 p.m. PT on NBC Sports Bay Area Plus.\n\nCricket is one of the most popular global sports, but in the US, it is just starting to gain national attention.\n\nThe recently completed T20 World Cup featured matches in Texas, New York and Florida, and Major League Cricket -- with the San Francisco Unicorns as one of its inaugural six teams -- is about to wrap up its second season.\n\nAll-rounder Corey Anderson is at the center of both events.\n\nThe 33-year-old New Zealand native moved to the US in 2020 and joined Team USA to help spearhead the growth of cricket in the country.\n\nAnderson, the Unicorns' captain, helped Team USA stun Pakistan in World Cup group play in one of the biggest upsets in all of sports in recent memory.\n\nNow Anderson and the Unicorns (four wins, one loss, one no-result) are vying to win the Major League Cricket championship. They finish their regular-season schedule against the Washington Freedom on Monday night.\n\nNews\n\nThe Unicorns and Freedom will meet again Thursday in the MLC Qualifier. The winner advances to the Final.\n\nMI New York and the Texas Super Kings meet in the Eliminator match. The loser is done, but the winner advances to the Challenger, where they will take on the loser of the Unicorns-Freedom Qualifier.\n\nThe winner of the challenger heads to the Final, which takes place Sunday in Grand Prairie, Texas -- the venue for a majority of MLC's matches. Others are being played in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nSo there is a real chance the Unicorns and Freedom could play three consecutive times in a six-day span.\n\nAhead of the Unicorns' match on Monday, Anderson spoke with NBC Sports Bay Area about his journey to the US, growing the sport in the country, his experience in the World Cup, the Unicorns signing Australian National Team captain Pat Cummins and cricket returning to the Olympics in 2028.\n\n[Editor's note: This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity]\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area: “You're a native New Zealander. You spent about eight years representing that country, but you retired from that team back in 2020. And you moved here. And you now represent the U.S. Give new fans of cricket a brief overview of your professional career and what went into your decision to leave New Zealand and come to the U.S.”\n\nCorey Anderson: “I played for New Zealand, as you said, for give-or-take about eight years and a few injuries through then, so it was probably a little bit off and on. But yeah, played in multiple World Cups with New Zealand and it was the dream when I was a kid to play for the Black Caps and then in COVID 2020. I came across to the States and my wife is from Dallas, so that was the big reason for moving across. And saw an opportunity with the major league and thought, ‘Everyone's always been wanting America to grow with cricket and it's always been something that everyone's been really intrigued with.’ And I thought, ‘What better than getting in there on the ground level and trying to help this thing grow?’\n\n“I've been here for a period of time now and I mean, it's been great. To play for the US in the World Cup was unbelievable and extremely exciting. I didn't think my career would quite take that path or that journey. But it's exciting.”\n\nNBCSBA: “When did the possibility of playing for Major League Cricket first pop up for you and what about that appealed to you?”\n\nAnderson: “I think having a new competition – there’s so many of them jumping up. But like I said before, I think America being a pretty untapped market in terms of cricket. It just had so much interest to it. And I've always loved the States and I love American sports, and I think there was just something about it that kind of attracted me to it and I think it was an opportunity that was too hard to pass up on.\n\n“Just the growth and being able to kind of try and get your fingerprints on a new sport in America and help it grow, I think was the most exciting part. So that said, a lot of hoops to jump through and a lot of hurdles to get over. But yeah, it's getting there.”\n\nNBCSBA: “What has your experience been like so far in the first two years of actual gameplay for Major League cricket?\n\nAnderson: “It's been fantastic. We're really lucky here that the grounds that we do have are at a really high quality and the overseas players that we have bought across, as well as some of the best in the world, some of the best that are going around the T20 circuit. In terms of a fan of the game, being able to watch that and get eyes on, again, the biggest players in the world. Pretty cool to have that at your own back doorstep.\n\n“It's taken a heap attraction and there's been so many eyes on it. It's very early in the journey for it, but yeah, being the second season now, it's gone up and up and up and you know, hopefully, it continues on that trend.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Do you expect in future seasons, the seasons, to get longer as you guys gain more traction?”\n\nAnderson: “Yeah, I would imagine so. I don't think to a to a huge degree. I think scheduling around other competitions is still something that's a continual work on for every competition. But yeah, I could see this progressing out to playing a home and away game, you know, 10 games in a season, then the playoffs. But again, that's probably the infrastructure part is the big issue.\n\n“That's an ongoing thing. That's probably the biggest piece to the puzzle that needs to get sorted. And that stuff takes time to get through city planning and trying to find land for that. Unfortunately, cricket's not the makeshift baseball stadium or football stadium. So we can’t kind of just move it to one place and pack it up in the next.\n\n“So you've got to basically grow these things from the ground up or renovate existing stadiums. They can have the room to do it. There's a lot more moving pieces to try and grow that. But it has started in a lot of other places in the home. Places like San Francisco as well have started those conversations and trying to start those contracts and the construction of those stadiums.”\n\nNBCSBA: “I believe I've heard that Santa Clara County is trying to get a stadium or they're trying to build a stadium in Santa Clara County just south of San Francisco. Have you been to San Francisco? Have you been to the Bay Area? What do you know about the Bay Area?”\n\nAnderson: “I don't know the Bay Area really well, but I've been there a few times now. We normally have a little bit of a preseason when we go in and I think we've been great in terms of trying to have fan activation and try to grow the brand itself as well. And I think we're probably one of the only times that's actually doing that and getting out to say our hands [are] dirty into the environment and try and actually get our fan base and grow it so when we do have a stadium that we can play it in the home ground, we've got a fan base that will happily turn up and make sure that we can fill out a stadium. I think we've done a great job toward that. And I know that the marketing group on the staff at the uniforms have done a tremendous job.”\n\nNBCSBA: \"You have played in the [Indian Premier League] and you've played in the Big Bash [in Australia]. Those are established leagues around the world. How far is Major League Cricket from reaching that level and what needs to be done to get there?”\n\nAnderson: “The IPL is probably the pinnacle of all sports in terms cricket for the franchises, but Major League [Cricket has] got the potential to compete with it.\n\n“I think if you look at the broadcasting landscape in America, it's one of the biggest sports broadcasting countries in the world. And again, it's just been so untapped and underdeveloped, particularly with cricket here in this country. If we can grow it on that level and attract, I guess, more Americans to watch the game and get involved with it, that's more of a long-term play.\n\n“But it has such a big upside to it. And I think that's why people have been so excited about it, is it's just got so much room to grow. And considering cricket's second biggest pool in the world and I know it's very much dominated by the South Asian culture, but there's no reason why Americans can't love it and get around it and make it their own as well, right?”\n\nNBCSBA: “Is the key to success for cricket and Major League Cricket in the US appealing to people that already follow cricket in this country? Or is it appealing to new fans who don't know much about cricket and getting them to understand and buy into the sport?”\n\nAnderson: “I think it's a combination. That it's trying to find a happy medium, I guess pleasing the masses of the ones who already are the diehard cricket lovers. And so we're going to turn up to the games and I think obviously we always appreciate the support, but I think trying to grow this into America is trying to grab that local fan base and say, ‘Hey, this is a new game. It's an exciting game. If you're intrigued by it, come down, watch it, learn it.’ And I think over the last couple of months as well, especially with the [T20] World Cup, there was a lot of coverage around that and a lot of people, a lot of media outlets who normally don't discuss cricket started talking about cricket, which is fantastic for the game in general.\n\n“But again, there's the thirst for it and we just need to make sure we can kind of keep applying that when we can. And yeah, I think it's got so much room to grow. It's exciting. It's an exciting time to be involved in cricket in America.\n\nNBCSBA: “You were part of the Team USA win over Pakistan [in the T20 World Cup], which was a massive upset. I was in New York at the time and I got alerts from national media, American media, that normally don't send alerts about cricket. But that was a big, big deal. That was talked about everywhere. What was it like being part of that and just that kind of an upset?”\n\nAnderson: “It's pretty surreal. I mean, USA Cricket in terms of I guess our fan base itself is we're kind of basically unknown to a degree. I think a lot of Americans didn't realize we even had a cricket team. So we were obviously massive underdogs in terms of trying to go up against these big nations. And I think the beauty of it as well as I've been on the other side of it, where I've played for one of the top eight nations in the world, and you're always a chance at winning and you're always trying to strike winning that trophy.\n\n“And I think being on the other side now, it's funny because I know that can scare teams when you're a little team because you can ruin someone's day and ruin someone's World Cup. I think the outlook we had was, yes, we were underdogs, but let's lean into that and kind of create a little bit of carnage.\n\n“And if we can catch people on the hop a little bit and have them vulnerable and we end up having a good day, then I know we've got the talent to be able to do it. And I think we saw that against Pakistan. You tend to find against those big teams, the big teams might crumble and just have a really bad day and they end up losing the game instead of the other team winning.\n\n“But I think in that regard, when we played Pakistan, we genuinely beat them. We actually won. We played really good cricket from Ball One all the way through. Ideally, it wouldn't have gone [to a] Super Over. We probably dragged that out a little bit too much, but we still did the job and I think for 95 percent of that game we were in control.\n\n“And I think that shows people the talent that we do have that we can compete against some of the biggest players in the world. And that was a huge confidence booster, not only for the guys themselves, but I think just the landscape of cricket in America to understand that yes, we can compete and we can perform against these big teams and it shows people that there is the hype that's been drawn in the last two or three years around Major League Cricket and trying to grow it kind of gives a bit of an answer to say this is why these things are in place and this is where we can get to and this is why we need to continue to play high levels of cricket against the best teams in the world. Because we can compete, we can get better, and the only way is up. The sky's the limit in where we can actually go to. And I know there's a lot of local talent, a lot of young kids who are really good at cricket, but unfortunately there's never really been a pathway for them to continue playing the game.\n\n“So with Major League Cricket and Minor League Cricket, we can now say to the younger generation, there's a career for you here if you want it, and if you want to keep pursuing it and you love this game, it's all in front of you. And I think now that's a good time to get into cricket because it's just going to get bigger and bigger.\"\n\nNBCSBA: “It sets the stage for future World Cups, for Team USA in future World Cups. But also Cricket is returning to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles. Do you hope to play for Team USA in four years and how do you see that stage helping cricket grow in the US?\"\n\nAnderson: “I think in four more years’ time, it’s hard to know what's going to happen in four years' time. I moved here four years ago and a lot's happened in that space of time. So, look, I think that I'm extremely excited to be able to potentially have the opportunity to be involved in another World Cup and also an Olympics. I think the great thing as well is that USA cricket's generally never had more than kind of 12 months in front of them where they could plan and they know what they're doing and schedule and things like that.\n\n“We've now got a four-year cycle here where in two years’ time there's another T20 World Cup to try and prepare for. Post that another two years after that there is an Olympics and it's on our shores. And I think that's just such an exciting prospect to say not only to the cricketers themselves, but to sponsors anyone who wants to get involved with USA cricket is a four-year cycle here, which is a huge time to get involved. And the upside is massive, obviously, because you're now on the biggest stage and we've shown that we can compete on the biggest stage.\n\n“And again, the USA always has this wonderful thing of any time they plan an event, regardless of what sport it is or what league it is, eyes are always tuned to the US because again, that one of the most powerful countries in the world and in terms of sport, they love sports and I think they love an underdog and they love a winner.\n\n“And I think when we started taking the blocks on both of those during the World Cup, we obviously didn't win it entirely. But I think we probably arguably won people's hearts over during that process. And I think that kind of goes a long way to it as well.”\n\nNBCSBA: “You definitely got people's attention in this country. I had coworkers who don't watch cricket who saw that and were like, ‘Were you there for that match? I'm like, “No, I was in New York, not in Dallas,’ but that's the attention that kind of upset got. It was people that don't normally watch it are talking about it. So that's kind of the goal, right? Is to win the matches and get people's attention.\"\n\nAnderson: “And that's the thing. And there's going to be so many different ways to try and attract people to the game. It can't always just be the one side, but it's got to be so, so many different angles and so many different ways to try and get people to get involved in this game and understand it and learn it and love it. And that's just one of those places I think everyone loves when they're in love, loves a story and a narrative behind that and I think we've created that and we just need to continue to keep growing that as well.\n\n“And it's exciting for people to kind of know that they got an early on the journey and can see it start to flourish and see where it gets to over a period of time. We will also take bandwagon fans as well if we get to a point of that as well. But I think it's just exciting to obviously be involved with it and get to the point where we're at the moment.\n\n“I think the guys have made such huge sacrifices to be here and I think that probably gets missed a little bit. I know a lot of the guys aren’t originally born in the US and have got very different stories around how they got here. And I’ve heard multiple times just through other sources in terms media that it a bit of an artificial team. I think the guys take offense to that in a way because we’ve sacrificed a lot to be in this situation and moving countries and uprooting your life is not easy. And the guys worked very, very hard to get where they are. I know when we put on the USA jersey, we’re extremely proud to play for it.\n\n“And I think that was the big thing we discussed during the World Cup. Yes, we’re not the favorite. We’re not expected to win. We’re not even expected to through to the top eight. But if we lose every game, results are results and you can’t really do anything about the outcome. But we wanted to make sure we made USA proud of the cricket team and there’s so many ways you can do that, whether its chasing a ball to boundary, keep fighting to the very end regardless of how it looks. And I think we did that for the majority of the tournament and that’s what people loved the most about it. I think our attitude towards our, I guess, our moral compass of why and how we’re playing for the US is fantastic. Hopefully we can just shepherd the next generation into that USA team and continue to grow.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Has there been any talk of like Team USA doing tours of [countries] like India or Pakistan or Australia, New Zealand or South Africa or any of the big eight countries?\n\nAnderson: “I think I think that's something that the ICC is always going to have to be the one who does the scheduling and figure out those future tours. But I think again, there’s a need and a want. We obviously would love to do it because it increases the value of what we are doing and the talent that we have that’ll keep producing cricketers here and being able to know that they can play against these players. But I think sometimes it doesn't always match up with those schedulings..\n\n“And I know that teams would love to come across to the States and again, in time, I think when we have more infrastructure that's going to be more and more feasible. But yeah, I think if it's teams wanting to do almost like a mini-tour before they go to another nation, like a warm-up series or something like that, I think at that moment where we're not going to be extremely picky around who wants to do it, they come to our shores and I think that's the exciting thing.\n\n“I think they know now that when they play the USA, we can compete and they can get some really good cricket and be tested as well. So that probably hasn't happened in the past. So that's probably changed the narrative around who we can potentially play in and when we potentially play them. So that's extremely exciting.”\n\nNBCSBA: “[The Unicorns] recently added Australian National Team captain Pat Cummins. What has it been like having him on somebody of his stature on the roster?”\n\nAnderson: “It's huge. I mean, any time you bring in one of the best players in the world, it's going to lift the team and they're going to be extremely excited to play alongside him. And [I’ve been] lucky enough to play with Pat a handful of times during the IPL and he's a great human being as well.\n\n“Sometimes the biggest players in the world, sometimes it goes the other way when they get into a changing room. But the amount of knowledge that [he] has and what he's willing to give to guys, to help them. I think he's also saying this is an opportunity to help grow the game and it's an exciting prospect.\n\n“And kudos to him as well. He’s had hardly any time over the last six months, basically, and for him to want to be involved with the Unicorns is huge. It's not only for the players to be able to have him involved and the fans, but just the marketing aspect of having Pat involved in groups.\n\n“I know he's helped me tremendously in terms of captaining the side, calling on him to be a bit of a sounding board when I'm out there in the middle as well. It's been so valuable. He's a great guy to have in the group and I'm glad he's here long-term as well.\"\n\nNBCSBA: “I know he signed a four-year contract so … he made a sizable commitment to playing in Major League Cricket, playing for the Unicorns like that. That has to feel good that somebody of his stature is willing to make that kind of commitment. [He’s going to] come here every year for the next couple of years, right?\"\n\nAnderson: “Massively. I think it's smart for his side. And I think smart from the Unicorn side as well. I think you want to you want to get the best players in the world and you want to try and have as long as you possibly can. So yeah, I think that's a win-win for both camps and I know I'm extremely excited to have him in the group for a lot longer.\n\n“Hopefully we can continue to have a similar group going forward as well. I know franchise cricket tends to change very quickly and scheduling and availability always seems to be an issue that comes up. But the group at the moment is fantastic and I know we're winning and it makes things a little bit easier as well.\n\n“But regardless of that, that's been a great group to be around. And yeah, hopefully, we can kind of stick together and keep continuing to grow our culture as well.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Pat was quoted in a story recently that he said your presence, along with Coach Shane Watson, played a part in his decision to play in Major League Cricket. What does it mean to you to have that kind of impact on your peers?”\n\nAnderson: “Yes, that's great. I think you can try and get guys who enjoy playing alongside you or things like that. That's obviously such a big, big one in terms of feeling proud about what you're doing. But again, I think when you look at cricket as a whole and you look at the guys that you play alongside when you're out there in the field and your batting and bowling and fielding that, that's obviously from what people see is a big part of the game.\n\n“Obviously it's how you win games and it's how you go about your stuff. But I think the human element of it being off the field and understanding that when you've got a team that you get along with and guys gel well together, you can go and have a drink question or a coffee or whatever it might be, that makes such a huge difference in the performance part as well.\n\n“Like I said before, Pat's just a great human being and there's probably not so many better guys to have involved in this group. It's extremely exciting to have him and it's nice of him to say those kind words.”\n\nNBCSBA: “You guys play Washington [on Monday] and then you play them again in a Qualifier. You could potentially play them a third straight time in the [Major League Cricket] Final. How do you see your squad matching up with Washington? And then when you're preparing for a match like that and you know you're going to see them again potentially two more times, do you potentially hold anything back in [Monday’s] match so that you don't give them anything to look out for the following matches or do you play it straight up?”\n\nAnderson: “Good question. I mean, it's probably a little bit more of a unique situation because, like you said, yeah, we could be looking at playing them three times in a row. That's in a perfect world. That would be nice if that's the case, because it would mean we’re through to the Final. But that being said, yeah, tonight's an interesting one.\n\n“We've had a few niggles in the camp regarding some injuries and things like that, so we've just got to be cautious. Obviously moving forward. It's always nice to know that you're already in that 1 and 2 spot and playing in the Finals with another life. But I think momentum and cricket's such a massive thing and I think most sports would probably say the same thing that you want to get your straps and you kind of want to keep going and when things are thinking, you get yourself in those situations, more than not, you start understanding how you need to win and it'll change from game to game.\n\n“But I don't think you want to take the foot off the throat or foot off the gas. I think, yeah, you still got to put your best foot forward and try and play the best cricket you can. And yeah, there might be some tactics around something slightly different. But again, I think the talent that we've got on our side is it's obviously extremely exciting. “And hopefully tonight, [it] goes similar way to what has been as well and guys can do their job and we can still get a win. Yeah nice to know we're through the Finals. Still got work to do.\"",

They come into this final match having lost each of their last four, most recently going down by six wickets to San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nLAST THREE: LLL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIt’s key to wait until the respective line-ups are announced before making any investments here. As this match has nothing at stake, both teams, particularly Texas Super Kings with a crunch eliminator on the horizon could choose to give their key players a rest. Captain Faf du Plessis should play though and remains top of the run-scoring table in Major League Cricket this season with 264 runs to his name so far. Back him to accumulate another 20+ runs here.\n\nMarcus Stoinis’ big-hitting exploits are not to be ignored as his brute power makes him a prime candidate for investment via the relevant betting markets available. Explore backing the Australian all-rounder to strike the most sixes across this encounter for Texas Super Kings.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWe mentioned Faf du Plessis and his position at the top of the run-scoring charts. Trailing just behind him is Ryan Rickelton, with 225 runs under his belt, including a top score of 103 not out. His personal ambition would likely be to try and overhaul his fellow South African, so backing him to score a fifty in this match may prove a smart move.\n\nWe’ve touched upon the bowling skills of domestic player Harmeet Singh previously and it’s these USA stars who arguably have the most to prove as we edge towards the latter end of this tournament. Harmeet no doubt wants to show that he is worthy of franchise gigs in other competitions down the line by adding to his eight wickets gained across this tournament. Back Harmeet to finish as Seattle’s top bowler here.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS VS SEATTLE ORCAS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nAs much as the Seattle Orcas management will want a win over the Super Kings to end their tournament, the reality is that most of their squad are likely to have their minds elsewhere at this point, specifically on their next cricketing assignment whether it be a franchise gig or international commitments.\n\nMotivation is higher for Texas Super Kings, knowing that two straight losses going into the play-offs would not bode well for them. Add that to home advantage being in their favour and the expectation is that Texas will gain the victory, even if they were to rotate their team.",

    "body": "Right then, that will be it from us for this contest. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. The action continues at the Major League Cricket, 2024. The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the Seattle Orcas in Match 21 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas. It will be another dead rubber as the four teams for the playoffs are already locked in. That game will be played on July 24th and will start at 6.00 am IST (12.30 am GMT). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nThe skipper of San Francisco Unicorns, Corey Anderson is up for a chat. He says that they had seen glimpses of Sanjay Krishnamurthi before and he feels proud of how Sanjay performed today. Adds that he is only 20 and he has got such maturity. Says that he will be a big player for them in their following games. Mentions that Hassan Khan is a key player for them as well and ends by saying that they can rely on him at any part of their innings.\n\nSteve Smith, the Washington Freedom skipper says that they played nicely and had a good score on board. Adds that it was a reasonable chase and the Unicorns batted well. Shares that they wanted to take the game on Travis Head has been exceptional. Mentions that today he got off to a fast start and Travis Head played as a second fiddle. Ends by lauding the Unicorn batters sharing that it got challenging with the wet outfield but plenty to learn in the rain-reduced game.\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his sensational knock. He says that he decided to go hard from the beginning. Adds that he wanted to take his chances and it came off today. Shares that he worked on the mental side, and that helped him to play freely. Mentions that it was not turning much for the left-arm spinners, so he was trying to keep a calm head in the middle and it paid off.\n\nJosh Inglis is in for a chat.

Adds that this will give them confidence in the qualifiers and this win was needed. Ends by saying that it was an outstanding innings from Sanjay Krishnamurthi and this is a good confidence booster for him.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Washington Freedom batted first and made 174 in 15.3 overs before the innings was shortened by rain. Both Travis Head and Steven Smith scored outstanding fifties while Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra played handy cameos. Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan were the pick of the bowlers for the Unicorns on a run fest day in Dallas. This win gets the San Francisco Unicorns on par with the Washington Freedom on the points table but they will finish second as the Freedom have a superior net run rate.\n\nWashington Freedom started well with the ball but failed to keep it tight through the middle and the latter over. Akeal Hosein got the early wicket of Finn Allen while Andrew Tye got three for 41. All the bowlers, except Rachin Ravindra went for over 12 runs to the over and it was absolute carnage. Washington Freedom did rest quite a few of their first-choice bowlers but wouldn't have thought to lose after setting a huge score. They will want to take the learnings from this game before they meet the Unicorns again in Qualifer 1.\n\nAn extraordinary run chase from the San Francisco Unicorns sees them defeat the Washington Freedom by 6 wickets with just 2 balls to spare. The Unicorns needed 177 to win off the 14 overs as per the DLS Method and they have done it in some style. Chasing the score, the openers departed early but Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis smoked it all around the park and added 77 runs in just 5 overs. Inglis made a quick-fire 45 off 17 while Hassan Khan chipped in with an unbeaten cameo of 32 off 11. The star of the chase was Sanjay Krishnamurthi who made a brilliant 79 off just 42 and took his team over the line. With this win, San Francisco Unicorns become the first side to defeat the Washington Freedom this season.\n\n4\n\nOvers12.6\n\nScore174 - 4\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar to Hassan Khan, FOUR! Make that three in a row! Full toss, outside off. Hassan Khan swings hard again and gets another outside edge that runs to the deep third region for a hat-trick of boundaries. San Francisco Unicorns just need three off the final over.\n\n6\n\nOvers11.5\n\nScore154 - 4\n\nAndrew Tye to Sanjay Krishnamurthi, SIX! THUMPED! Slower and fuller in the slot. Sanjay Krishnamurthi picks it early and hammers it over the deep square leg boundary for half a dozen. Sanjay Krishnamurthi is playing a gem of a knock here. The equation is now 23 off 13 balls.\n\nW\n\nOvers9.6\n\nScore122 - 4\n\nAndrew Tye to Sherfane Rutherford, OUT! STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR AND TAKEN! Tye gets two in the over! Goes short of a length, around off. Sherfane Rutherford miscues the pull and goes straight up in the air. Andrew Tye goes to his right and takes a good catch off his bowling. Sherfane Rutherford departs for a second ball duck. San Francisco Unicorns are four down.\n\nW\n\nOvers9.4\n\nScore122 - 3\n\nAndrew Tye to Josh Inglis, OUT! CAUGHT! Josh Inglis is gone!

San Francisco's captain, Corey Anderson, won the toss and asked the Washington Freedom to bat first, who concluded their innings at 174/3 in 15.3 before the rain halted the play.\n\nCaptain Steven Smith (56 off 31 balls) and opener Travis Head (56 off 36 balls) struck fifties for Washington.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns were given the revised target of 177 in 14 overs.

When Sanjay got fascinated with cricket after seeing the 2011 World Cup with his dad, his family decided to relocate to their native of Bangalore.\n\nIn a conversation with Cricbuzz, Sanjay's father Satya Krishnamurthi said:\n\n“Fortunately, I was able to spend a lot of time with him after our move over there and focus on cricket. We built cricket nets with a bowling machine for Sanjay in our backyard.”\n\n#2 He was selected in the Spin Star talent hunt launched by Anil Kumble when he was 11\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi initially started his career as a left-arm spinner. In 2022, during a conversation with the SIX Cricket Community, he said:\n\n“At 11, I was selected in the Anil Kumble spin-star talent hunt. I was selected in the top 20.”\n\n#3 Sanjay decided to focus more on batting after scoring runs in School cricket\n\nIn an interview with SIX Cricket Community, he discussed the transition from spinner to batter:\n\n“In my last year of under 16, I scored a lot of runs, opening the batting for my school team, and then decided to focus more on batting that year.”\n\nIn the highly competitive Bangalore schools' cricket league, Sanjay went on to score more than 500 runs in six games. As a result, he was chosen for the Karnataka State Cricket Association U-16 team.\n\n#4 He came back to Houston in 2020\n\nSanjay came to Houston at the start of 2020 to participate in a USA Cricket training camp. From then on, he has concentrated on his US cricket career. After the players' draft, Sanjay was selected for the Minor League Cricket competition in the United States in June 2021.\n\n#5 The right-handed batter made his international debut in 2021\n\nSanjay made his international debut against Nepal in 2021. He has played three ODI matches in his career and only managed to score 13 runs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi has shown his class in the MLC and will be looking to score some runs for his nation if he gets the opportunity in the future.",

    "body": "The final league fixture of the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) will witness the Texas Super Kings (TSK) take on the Seattle Orcas (SOR). The contest is a dead rubber to a degree with TSK having sealed a place in the Eliminator clash, while SOR have also officially finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nDespite their fate being sealed, both sides would love to end the league stage on a high. TSK will look for some momentum ahead of the high-octane Eliminator clash against the MI New York, especially having lost to the Washington Freedom by a significant margin.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas, on the other hand, have to play for their pride. Following a successful maiden season in 2023 where they finished as runner-ups, the franchise could only compile a single win this time around and are currently on a four-game losing streak.\n\nEven though it has not been a very memorable season for both sides, particularly the Seattle Orcas, there have been some standout individual performers from both sides. On that note, let us take a look at a combined Texas Super Kings-Seattle Orcas playing 11 for MLC 2024.\n\nTop order: Faf du Plessis, Ryan Rickleton, and Quinton de Kock\n\nTSK skipper Faf du Plessis is the leading scorer of the tournament so far with 264 runs in five matches at a strike rate of 166.03. He recorded a stunning hundred against the Washington Freedom and has scored consecutive fifties in his last two appearances against the MI New York and the reverse fixture against the Washington Freedom.\n\nAfter a prolific SA20 2024 campaign where he ended up as the leading run scorer, Rickleton has carried the same form into the MLC as well. He was part of the South Africa squad that finished runner-ups in the 2024 T20 World Cup but failed to avail a single chance in the playing XI. In the ongoing season, he has accumulated 225 runs in five innings at a strike rate of 149.\n\nQuinton de Kock has donned the role at No.3 with the Seattle Orcas, and he has done a decent job of it. The left-handed wicket-keeper batter has scored 144 runs in six outings at a strike rate of 123.07.\n\nMiddle Order: Heinrich Klaasen, Marcus Stoinis, and Calvin Savage\n\nThe Seattle Orcas skipper had memorable IPL and T20 World Cup campaigns, despite ending up as runner-ups in both. However, his momentum seems to have run its course for the momentum as he had a mediocre MLC 2024 season. He has only scored 93 runs in six matches, including one fifty. However, he still remains one of the best batters in the format, and remains a threat for the opposition.\n\nStoinis came into the MLC on the back of a brilliant 2024 T20 World Cup for Australia. The all-rounder has been decent with the bat and expensive with the ball but has been among the wickets in a very short time.\n\nCalvin Savage has been a handy player for TSK in the lower middle order. He has scored 75 runs in four innings at a strike rate of 153, including a quick-fire 35 in TSK's most recent outing.\n\nLower Order: Imad Wasim, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Gannon, Zia-ul-Haq, and Harmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon is among the leading wicket-takers in the tournament with 10 wickets in six matches. The pacer is the joint second-highest wicket-taker along with Rashid Khan. Although his economy is a bit on the higher side, he is an able spearhead to the bowling attack.\n\nThe TSK pace bowling duo of Dwayne Bravo and Zia-ul-Haq are valuable additions to the attack to bring balance and variety. Zia-ul-Haq is the joint-highest wicket-taker for TSK with six scalps. while the veteran Bravo has picked up four wickets in four matches, with an economy of 8.36 while bowling the tough overs.\n\nThe spin attack of Imad Wasim and Harmeet Singh has been difficult for the batters to deal with considering their varied skill set. The left-arm finger spinners have picked up a combined total of 12 wickets, with their average economy reading just 7.10.",
    "summary": "* The final league fixture of MLC 2024 will feature Texas Super Kings (TSK) against Seattle Orcas (SOR), with TSK already securing a spot in the Eliminator clash and SOR finishing at the bottom of the table.\n* Both teams aim to end the league stage on a high, with TSK seeking momentum ahead of their Eliminator clash against MI New York and SOR playing for pride.\n* Despite a disappointing season, there have been standout individual performers from both teams, including Faf du Plessis, Ryan Rickleton, Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, Marcus Stoinis, Calvin Savage, Imad Wasim, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Gannon, Zia-ul-Haq, and Harmeet Singh.\n* These players have contributed to their teams with impressive batting and bowling performances, with some of them being among the top scorers and wicket-takers in the tournament.",

This game will thus serve as a preparatory ground as they will face each other yet again.\n\nOn that note, here is a combined playing 11 with players from both sides ahead of their final league stage match.\n\nCombined San Francisco Unicorns-Washington Freedom playing 11 for MLC 2024\n\nOpeners: Finn Allen, Travis Head\n\nFinn Allen, with 186 runs from five innings at a strike-rate of 202.17, is the fifth-highest run-getter of the tournament. He has scored the most runs for San Francisco this year.\n\nIn their previous outing against Seattle, Allen struck a brutal 30-ball 77, striking at 256.66, that helped them chase down a total of 152 with ease.\n\nPartnering him at the top would be Travis Head, who has also displayed great form for Washington Freedom. With 194 runs from six games, he is the third-highest run-getter of the MLC 2024.\n\nHead has been consistent throughout, smashing three fifties and a hundred, including a 22-ball 53 in the last match.\n\nMiddle-order and all-rounders: Steve Smith (C), Rachin Ravindra, Andries Gous (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Corey Anderson\n\nSteve Smith has proved to be a great inclusion for Washington Freedom this season. He has scored 191 runs from six innings at an average of 63.66 and is the fourth-highest run-getter as well.\n\nThe Washington Freedom skipper scored a crucial 57 in the last game and would also captain this combined side.\n\nRachin Ravindra may not have shone with the bat in the MLC 2024 so far, scoring only 69 runs from four innings. However, he has been a key asset with the ball for Washington Freedom, picking up five wickets, including a four-fer in their previous fixture.\n\nAndries Gous would handle the wicket-keeping duties. He has a fifty to his name this season and has displayed some power-hitting ability. Gous scored a quickfire 9-ball 15 in the last game as well.\n\nGlenn Maxwell has not been as effective with the bat this season yet. He has only managed to score 59 runs from three innings. However, he scored a crucial 23-ball 34 in the previous match and grabbed three wickets as well. His all-round skills make him a valuable asset.\n\nObus Pienaar played a vital role in giving Washington Freedom a solid finish with the bat in their last match. He scored an unbeaten 21-ball 33. Pienaar has displayed his ability to provide stability down the order and contribute with some important runs as well.\n\nCorey Anderson is another all-round who would add to the strength of this combined team. He has a high score of an unbeaten 59 this season and also picked up a wicket in the last game against Texas.\n\nBowlers: Hassan Khan, Jasdeep Singh, Lockie Ferguson\n\nLeft-arm spinner Hassan Khan has picked up six wickets in the tournament for the San Francisco Unicorns. He impressed in the previous game, returning with figures of 3/5 from his two overs, thus also being economical.\n\nJasdeep Singh, coming in for Saurabh Netravalkar, had big shoes to fill in. The right-arm pacer has been brilliant for Washington Freedom in his limited opportunities this season.\n\nJasdeep has picked up six wickets from just two games at an economy rate of 5.57. He also bagged three wickets in their last match against Texas, giving away just 25 runs in four overs.\n\nLockie Ferguson is the fifth-highest wicket-taker in MLC 2024 at the moment. He has accounted for nine wickets from six games with a decent economy rate of 7.27. Ferguson has also picked up four-fer in the MLC this season.",

To start, Finn Allen was sent packing on the very first ball of the innings by Akeal Hosein.\n\nDespite the early setback, Jake Fraser-McGurk and Sanjay Krishnamurthi took an aggressive approach, smashing 42 runs in the reduced Powerplay of 4 overs. However, Fraser-McGurk was caught behind by Andries Gous off Andrew Tye in the next over, having scored 18 off 9 balls.\n\nKrishnamurthi, who was dropped by Mukhtar Ahmed at 13 in the second over, reached his fifty off 28 balls in the eighth over.

The pair brought up the team's 100-run mark in 9.3 overs. However, Smith was dismissed by Corey Anderson on the next ball, scoring a remarkable 56 off 31 balls.\n\nHead continued his red-hot form as he reached his fourth successive fifty in 34 balls, but was also dismissed by Anderson in the 12th over after scoring 56 off 36 balls, leaving Washington at 122/2.\n\nRachin Ravindra then played a quick cameo, scoring 16 off 6 balls before getting run out in the 14th over.

    "body": "Led by Sanjay Krishnamurthi's unbeaten 79 off 42 balls and Josh Inglis' rapid 45 off 17, the San Francisco Unicorns handed the Washington Freedom their first loss of the season in the penultimate league stage match of the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium on Monday.\n\nDespite Steve Smith and Travis Head each scoring half-centuries to guide Washington Freedom to 174/3 in 15.3 overs, the Unicorns managed their run-chase flawlessly in a rain-affected game, securing a six-wicket victory (DLS Method).\n\nTrending\n\nBoth teams ended the league stage with 11 points from seven matches, with Washington Freedom finishing on top due to a superior Net Run Rate, while the San Francisco Unicorns placed second.\n\nWith the game reduced to 14 overs due to rain, San Francisco Unicorns were given a DLS-adjusted target of 177 runs to win. Finn Allen was sent packing on the very first ball of the innings by Akeal Hosein.\n\nDespite the early setback, Jake Fraser-McGurk and Sanjay Krishnamurthi took an aggressive approach, smashing 42 runs in the Powerplay of 4 overs. However, Fraser-McGurk was caught behind by Andries Gous off Andrew Tye in the next over, having scored 18 off 9 balls.\n\nKrishnamurthi, who was dropped by Mukhtar Ahmed at 13 in the second over, reached his fifty off 28 balls in the eighth over. Meanwhile, Josh Inglis delivered a blistering innings of 45 runs off 17 balls, featuring six sixes and just one four. He smashed three consecutive sixes off Jack Edwards in the ninth over, reducing the target to 67 runs needed from 30 balls.\n\nTye, who was hit for two sixes by Inglis in the second and third balls of his second over, had the last laugh as he dismissed Inglis on the fourth ball and went on to strike again, removing Sherfane Rutherford on the last ball of the 10th over.\n\nKrishnamurthi then took charge of the run chase, teaming up with Hassan Khan to score 33 runs in the next two overs, reducing the target to 22 runs needed from 12 balls. Riding on stunning momentum, both batters chased down the target with ease with two balls to spare.\n\nEarlier in the contest, Steve Smith and Travis Head gave Washington Freedom a flying start, amassing 70 runs in the Powerplay. The pair brought up the team's 100-run mark in the 9.3 over. However, Smith was dismissed by Corey Anderson on the next ball, scoring a remarkable 56 off 31 balls.\n\nHead continued his red-hot form as he reached his fourth successive fifty in 34 balls, but was also dismissed by Anderson in the 12th over after scoring 56 off 36 balls, leaving Washington at 122/2.\n\nRachin Ravindra then played a quick cameo, scoring 16 off 6 balls before getting run out in the 14th over. Gous (29* off 20) continued to find timely boundaries until rain halted play after 15.3 overs, with Washington at 174/3. The match was then shifted to a 14-over chase for San Francisco.\n\nHaving finished in the top two, both Washington Freedom and San Francisco square off against each other in the Qualifier on July 25 at 0730 PM Local Time at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nRachin Ravindra then played a quick cameo, scoring 16 off 6 balls before getting run out in the 14th over.

    "body": "On the back of a vintage display of power hitting from Captain Kieron Pollard and some responsible batting from Nicholas Pooran, defending champions MI New York booked a spot in the 2024 Major League Cricket Playoffs with a four-wicket win over the Los Angeles Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas on Sunday.\n\nBoth teams entered Sunday’s clash knowing a win would be good enough for them to join the San Francisco Unicorns, Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings in the playoffs.\n\nAfter winning the toss and electing to field first, MI New York restricted the LA Knight Riders to 130 all out off 19.1 overs.\n\nThe hard-hitting Andre Russell did the bulk of the scoring for the Sunil Narine-led knight Riders with 35 while Jason Roy hit 27 at the top of the innings.\n\nLeg-spinner Rashid Khan was the pick of the New York bowlers with 3-22 from his four overs while Nosthush Kenjige and Trent Boult supported well with two wickets, each.\n\nMI New York then needed only 17 overs to reach 134-6 and book their spot in the playoffs after winning just one of their first six games of the season.\n\nNicholas Pooran led the way with 35 off 28 balls but it was Pollard’s blistering 33* off just 12 balls that sealed victory.\n\nPooran’s knock included two fours and as many sixes while Pollard hit two fours and three sixes.\n\nDewald Brevis also chipped in with a 19-ball 27.\n\nNarine took 2-24 from his four overs for the Knight Riders.\n\nFull Scores:\n\nLA Knight Riders 130 all out off 19.1 overs (Andre Russell 35, Jason Roy 27, Rashid Khan 3-22, Nosthush Kenjige 2-22, Trent Boult 2-38)\n\nMI New York 134-6 off 17 overs (Nicholas Pooran 35, Kieron Pollard 33*, Dewald Brevis 27, Sunil Narine 2-24)\n\nBen Stokes hailed Shoaib Bashir after the 20-year-old's five-wicket haul helped England clinch a series victory over West Indies on Sunday.\n\nEngland surged to a 243-run victory on day four at Trent Bridge, with Bashir finishing with figures of 5-41.\n\nThe hosts started the day 248-3 thanks to a terrific partnership between Joe Root (122) and Harry Brook (109), ultimately setting the Windies a target of 385 to win.\n\nBashir bowled a spell of 3-8 in 15 deliveries, then put some gloss on his performance by rounding off the tail with the dismissals of Jason Holder and Shamar Joseph.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the win, captain Stokes said: \"I didn't see it happening that quickly after the opening partnership, I thought they played well.\n\n\"You could see at the end of our innings the wicket started misbehaving more than it did in the first three days, a couple were bouncing and then keeping low.\n\n\"I thought the way we fought back after that first wicket was impressive, Bashir getting five wickets on a wicket that didn't really do that much.\n\n\"I thought he showed his class and his ability to be able to change his pace and undercut the ball. The wicket of Jason Holder showed the world what he's got.\"\n\nEngland will now target a series sweep when the Windies go to Edgbaston next week, before taking on Sri Lanka in three Tests between late August and early September.\n\n\"It has been a great start after a long break between Test series. I think we've played some good cricket but I still think we can get better,\" Stokes said.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to the next four matches.\"\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events on the fourth day of the second Test at Trent Bridge, the West Indies suffered a resounding 241-run defeat to England, sealing a 2-0 series loss with one Test still to play. Despite the crushing defeat, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite remained optimistic, acknowledging the team's effort while highlighting areas for improvement.\n\nEngland's Shoaib Bashir was the star of the match, claiming his first five-wicket haul on English soil. His 5 for 41 wrapped up the West Indies innings inside 90 minutes of the final session, ensuring England's dominant victory.\n\nReflecting on the match, Brathwaite said, \"I'm reasonably happy with the performance, but it could have been better with the ball. We were good in the first innings but didn't follow through in the second. The effort from the guys was there; the fitness is evident. We need to be much more disciplined. England showed us how to bowl on this pitch, particularly avoiding getting hit square of the wicket. But the guys will learn. Kavem's hundred followed by a duck is just how Test cricket goes.\"\n\nBrathwaite continued, \"We dropped some crucial catches, and that happens. We need to improve our line and length, but catches win matches. I wouldn't have expected that collapse, but it's gone, it's history. Test cricket is never an easy game. We've got to stay tough and keep fighting.\"\n\nEngland's comprehensive win was set up by centuries from Joe Root and Harry Brook, who propelled the hosts to 425 in their second innings. This marked the first time in England's history that they scored over 400 runs in both innings of a Test. Chasing a daunting target of 385, the West Indies started positively, reaching 61 without loss thanks to Brathwaite and Mikyle Louis. However, a devastating spell from Chris Woakes and Bashir saw the team crumble, losing 5 for 21 in the space of 35 balls and ultimately bowled out for 143.\n\nBrathwaite was the top scorer for the West Indies with 47 runs, but his efforts were overshadowed by Bashir's record-breaking performance. At 20 years and 282 days, Bashir became the youngest England bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a men's Test at home, surpassing the previous record held by recently retired seamer James Anderson.\n\nEngland's first innings score of 416, bolstered by Ollie Pope's 121 and contributions from Ben Duckett and Ben Stokes, set the stage for their commanding position. The West Indies initially responded well with 457, featuring a century from Hodge and notable performances from Da Silva and Athanaze. However, the team faltered in their second innings, leading to a decisive English victory.",

However, the highlight of the match was undoubtedly Akeal Hosein’s dismissal of Finn Allen for a golden duck.\n\nAkil Hossein’s deadly delivery\n\nWhile Krishnamurthi’s inning was undoubtedly crucial, Hosein’s dismissal of Finn captured everyone’s attention. Allen, known for his aggressive batting, came to the crease with high expectations. However, Hosein had other plans.\n\nThe left-arm spinner delivered a skiddy delivery that came into the right-hander. Allen, looking to pull, was deceived by the pace and trajectory of the ball. The delivery crashed into the middle stump, leaving Allen stunned and Washington’s dugout in jubilation.\n\nHosein’s dismissal of Allen was a crucial breakthrough for Washington.

The chase, however, wasn’t without its hiccups. Chasing a modest target of 135, New York found themselves in a precarious position at 102/5 in the 13th over. But then came the turning point of the match – Kieron Pollard‘s awe-inspiring display of power hitting.\n\nKieron Pollard unleashes a six-hitting frenzy.\n\nWith the pressure mounting and playoffs hanging in the balance, Pollard stepped onto the field, shouldering the responsibility of reviving his team’s fortunes. The 14th over witnessed a masterclass in power hitting as Pollard took on LA Knight Riders’ bowler Spencer Johnson.\n\nThe first ball was dispatched over mid-wicket for a six, setting the tone for what was to come. Johnson attempted to change tactics with a length ball angling in, but Pollard responded with a monstrous 91-meter six over square leg. The crowd roared in appreciation as Pollard completed the hattrick of sixes with a disdainful chip over the bowler’s head for another maximum.\n\nThese three consecutive sixes not only yielded 18 crucial runs but also completely shifted the match’s momentum. The required run rate, once a daunting task, suddenly seemed achievable. Pollard continued his assault, adding another boundary and bringing his side to an easy match-winning situation with a well-made 33 runs off just 12 deliveries.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Pat Cummins and Corey Anderson star in the comedy of errors on the pitch in MLC 2024\n\nNicholas Pooran’s professional approach gets MI through to playoffs\n\nEarlier, despite Andre Russell‘s 35, LA Knight Riders failed miserably as a batting unit.

Ultimately, they were restricted to 130 runs thanks to bowling spells from Rashid Khan (3/22) and Nosthush Kenjige (2/22).\n\nOn the other hand, New York started shaky and under immense pressure.

The wicket came in the final over of LAKR’s innings and ended their challenge at 130 runs, giving Pollard’s team a clear path to chase down the target.\n\nA defining moment for Kieron Pollard\n\nPollard’s dismissal of Russell was a high-pressure scenario that saw the veteran all-rounder rise to the occasion. With LAKR struggling at 102/9 in the 17th over, Russell’s explosive hitting had propelled their score past the 130 runs mark. Russell was on a roll, having struck two boundaries each too Rashid Khan, Romario Shepherd and Trent Boult. His 35 off 20 deliveries was a significant contribution, but he found himself facing Pollard in the final over.\n\nThe final over drama: Battle with Andre Russell\n\nPollard, known for his match-winning abilities, took charge of the last over with the game hanging in balance. He delivered a length ball, which Russell attempted to pull but could only manage a top edge. Wicket-keeper Nicholas Pooran, alert to the situation, sprinted to his left and made a crucial catch, dismissing Russell and sealing the innings for LAKR. Pollard’s ecstatic celebration, including wild screams and jubilant fist pumps, reflected the importance of the moment and his relief at securing the crucial wicket.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso READ: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024: Broadcast, live streaming details – When and Where to watch in India, US, UK, Australia & other countries\n\nPollard’s power play secures MI New York’s playoff spot\n\nNew York’s chase was anchored by Dewald Brevis, who provided a solid foundation with a brisk 27.

His unbeaten 33 off just 12 balls not only secured the victory but also highlighted his finishing prowess.

    "body": "Mumbai Indians New York skipper Kieron Pollard led from the front in the game against Los Angeles Knight Riders in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. The 19th match of the tournament between the teams took place at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday (22nd July).\n\nKieron Pollard was at the top of his game with the bat and ball in the game against Los Angeles Knight Riders. In a game where qualification was at stake, the all-rounder came up with a clutch performance and helped his team win the game and enter the playoffs of the second edition of the Major League Cricket.\n\nKieron Pollard first gave himself the responsibility to bowl the last over of the innings against Andre Russell, who was going great guns. The Mumbai Indians New York skipper, however, made sure he stepped up for his team and removed his Carribean teammate to put his team in a strong position.\n\nOn the first ball of the last over, Kieron Pollard banged in a short ball on middle stump. Andre Russell got rushed by it as he tried to pull the ball which hit the splice and went up. Keeper Nicholas Pooran covered a lot of ground to his left and took a good catch.\n\nWhat caught the attention of many was the celebration of Kieron Pollard after he took the wicket of Andre Russell. The Mumbai Indians New York skipper got pumped up as he got rid of a dangerous batter. He celebrated aggressively and the video of that went viral on the internet.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nAfter removing Andre Russell with the ball, Kieron Pollard came up with a magical effort with the bat. Mumbai Indians New York needed to chase the target of 131 runs in 18.2 overs and his team was left tottering at 91/5. But it was the skipper who came up with a magical effort and took his team home.\n\nKieron Pollard scored an unbeaten 33 runs off 12 balls as he did the carnage on the bowlers. The all-rounder batted with a strike rate of 275 and slammed 2 fours and 3 sixes in his innings. His knock ensured that Mumbai Indians New York chased the target in 17 overs and qualified for the playoffs.\n\nIt was a plan that worked out in the end - Kieron Pollard on his bowling\n\nKieron Pollard talked about the win after the game and claimed that he was relieved. He talked about the pride he takes in performing for Mumbai Indians. The all-rounder also opened up about his bowling and stated that his plan worked out. Speaking at the post-match presentation, he explained:\n\n\"Very relieved, congrats to the entire team. The way we fought, everyone chipped in usefully. If we look at the history of how we've batted, 130 was a tough ask. But we got another opportunity, and the attitude shown by everyone was fantastic. I've had some experience, Nosthush came to me after one game and said that things would turn out well, my family was always backing me, coming from a young player, it meant a lot. I always pride myself on performing for the franchise and I'm glad it came off today.\n\n\"It was a plan that worked out in the end (on bowling the 20th over), I could've gone for 20 and they could have got past 150. I could have gone for the young guy (Rushil Ugarkar), but it was one of the days when we got what we wanted. I heard that one of the supporters in the crowd got hit, I hope she's OK and I hope we can do something for her on our part to make her happy,\" he concluded.",

    "body": "3 minute read\n\nAustralia skipper Pat Cummins has joined the party at Major League Cricket as he features for a San Francisco Unicorns side well stacked with Baggy Greens stars.\n\nCummins has a number of fellow Aussies taking part in the 20-over competition in the United States, with Washington Freedom currently leading the way inspired by Steven Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell.\n\nFreedom - 2.40 to secure the MLC title - have won all five of their completed fixtures, with a washout the only thing robbing them of a 100 per cent record, while Cummins features for a Unicorns outfit who lie second in the standings with three wins from five games.\n\nFreedom march on thanks to Aussie batters\n\nIn the most recent fixture Washington saw off Texas Super Kings by 42 runs to maintain their unbeaten record, with Smith and Head both making half-centuries at the top of the order.\n\nIt's fair to say Head dominated the partnership as he was dismissed for 53, having added 59 for the first wicket with Smith, with Maxwell later smacking three sixes in his 34 and then taking three wickets with his off-spin.\n\nHead (194) and Smith (191) have certainly been enjoying themselves with the bat, as they lie third and fourth respectively; in the runscorers' chart in MLC, with South African Faf du Plessis leading the way with 264 runs for Super Kings.\n\nDu Plessis is one of two century-makers in MLC so far this season, with fellow South African Ryan Rickelton the other player to reach three figures, for Seattle Orcas.\n\nAussie pair back up Du Plessis\n\nPlaying alongside former Proteas skipper Du Plessis at Super Kings are Baggy Greens pair Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Hardie, with the former having made more of an impression with the ball than he has with the bat so far.\n\nIn fairness, neither player has excelled to date and both will want to deliver more for their side, with 6.00 Texas currently well-placed to ensure a top-four finish and a place in the play-offs - only two of the six teams miss out on the end-of-season finale.\n\nTim David has also yet to fire for reigning champions MI New York in his three appearances, while both Alex Carey and Adam Zampa have yet to feature for Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nLeft-arm quick Spencer Johnson has sparked for the 9.00 Knight Riders, however, taking eight wickets at 19.75 in his five games to date, although that wickets tally is one less than Maxwell has snapped up for Freedom.\n\nCummins adds to the Aussie mix\n\nThat leaves us with Unicorns, who have added Cummins to a roster which already features his fellow Aussies Matt Short, Josh Inglis and Jake Fraser-McGurk and who are 3.75 to be crowned champions.\n\nShort has passed 50 twice in his four knocks so far this season in MLC, but neither Inglis nor Fraser-McGurk have made significant contributions to date, while Cummins has taken just one wicket across his two appearances.\n\nHe will want to help San Francisco make certain of a play-off place, with Unicorns having missed out during the inaugural MLC season last year, with New York eventually defeating Orcas by seven wickets in the final.",
    "summary": "**Current Standings:** Washington Freedom is leading the tournament with a 5-0 record, followed by San Francisco Unicorns in second place with a 3-2 record.\n\n**Australian Players:** Several Australian players are participating in the tournament, including Steven Smith, Travis Head, and Glenn Maxwell for Washington Freedom, and Pat Cummins, Matt Short, Josh Inglis, and Jake Fraser-McGurk for San Francisco Unicorns. Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Hardie are playing for Texas Super Kings.\n\n**Notable Performances:** Steven Smith and Travis Head have been in good form, with both making half-centuries in their recent match. Faf du Plessis is the leading run-scorer with 264 runs, and Ryan Rickelton is the other century-maker in the tournament so far.\n\n**Teams' Chances:** Washington Freedom is favored to win the title at 2.40, while San Francisco Unicorns has a good chance at 3.75. Texas Super Kings is well-placed to make the playoffs at 6.00, and Los Angeles Knight Riders has an outside chance at 9.00.\n\n**Playoffs:** The top four teams will make it to the playoffs, with two teams missing out.",

Smith scored 56 off 31 balls and his knock was laden with four sixes and five fours. Whereas Head hit three sixes and five boundaries for his 36-ball 56, his fourth straight fifty in the competition.\n\nChasing a revised target of 177 in 14 overs, the San Francisco Unicorns got to the target in just 13.4 overs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi remained unbeaten on 79 off 42 balls for SFU while Josh Inglis hit 45 from 17 balls.\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Tye finished as the top wicket-taker in the match with figures of 3/41.\n\nBatting first, Head and Smith did what they have done throughout the season, by providing us a rollicking start. Smith took the role of the aggressor smashing three sixes and five fours in the powerplay as we raced to 70/0 after the first six overs, the fourth fifty-plus stand for the Aussies together this season.\n\nSmith powered to a 25-ball fifty in the eighth over and soon the duo got to our first 100-run partnership in the history of MLC before the skipper departed. Head shifted gears to get to his half-century in just 34 balls continuing his purple patch this season.\n\nRachin Ravindra and Andries Gous kept the scoring rate high with an entertaining partnership of 33 off only 15 balls. Just as we were looking to go past the 200-run mark for the second consecutive game, rain halted proceedings, cutting short our batting essay with 27 balls remaining.\n\nAkeal Hosein gave us a great start after the rain delay, striking with the first ball of the chase to send back Finn Allen. Andrew Tye dismissed the big fish, Jake Fraser-McGurk, leaving both openers back in the hut by the fifth over with the score at 45.\n\nThe experienced Tye brought us back into the match with two wickets in an over after Krishnamurthi and Inglis added 77 runs in just 30 balls for the third wicket. In the end, the San Francisco Unicorns chased down the target with two balls to spare.\n\nHassan Khan contributed a cameo of 32 from 11 balls, while Krishnamurthi remained unbeaten on 79. Apart from Tye, Hosein picked up 1/39 from his three overs.\n\nHowever, the result had no bearing on the points table of MLC 2024 as we finished on top with 11 points from seven games after all our group engagements.\n\nWe will meet the San Francisco Unicorns again in the Qualifier of MLC 2024 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday.\n\nWashington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns MLC 2024 brief scores: WF 174/3 in 15.3 overs (Steve Smith 56, Travis Head 56, Corey Anderson 2/20) vs SFU 177/4 in 13.4 overs (Sanjay Krishnamurthi 79*, Josh Inglis 45, Andrew Tye 3/41, Akeal Hosein 1/39).\n\nWashington Freedom lost by six wickets by DLS method.",

    "body": "After the ICC Mens T20 World Cup thrilled American sports fans with top-tier cricket matches at venues in Florida, New York and Texas, Major League Cricket is gearing up for an exciting second season of progress.\n\nMajor League Cricket will conclude its 21-match season this week, culminating in a thrilling four-team play-off to crown a new champion. Despite having six teams spread across the country, all competitions are being held on dedicated cricket grounds in Texas and North Carolina. Remarkably, attendances are on track to surpass the impressive 70,000 fans who turned out for the inaugural season in 2023.\n\nA key strategy Major League Cricket has employed to attract a broader audience is its media rights arrangement with Cricbuzz’s Willow, a specialist cricket channel. Willow has established partnerships with regional sports networks in each team’s local market, including Bally Sports SoCal for Los Angeles, Monumental Sports Network for Washington, DC, and NBC Sports Bay Area for San Francisco, among many others. This tactic mirrors Willow’s successful approach during the T20 World Cup, where it focused on increasing visibility.\n\nIn terms of finances, Major League Cricket operates within a salary cap of $1.15 million per team. While this figure is below the generous budgets seen in global leagues such as the Indian Premier League, which allows franchises to spend around $12 million annually, it remains competitive with leagues such as Cricket Australia ($2 million) and The Hundred ($1.3 million) in the UK.\n\nLiam Plunkett, a bowler for the San Francisco Unicorns and member of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, praises the quality and competitiveness of the competition. “The money is good. But the product is good too,” Plunkett notes, highlighting the high standard of play that attracts fans and players alike.\n\nSan Francisco’s signing of Australian national team captain Pat Cummins on a four-year contract ahead of the season was a major move that reflects the league’s ambition. Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman reveals that such contracts have proven surprisingly feasible given the excitement surrounding the emerging US cricket market.\n\nLooking ahead, the league has ambitious plans for expansion, aiming to establish stadiums in each team’s market and expand the schedule to 34 games by 2025. With the intention of increasing the number of franchises to 10, Major League Cricket is poised for continued growth and success in the American sports landscape.\n\nRelated\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

The top order struggled a lot. Their prime form batters including Matthew Short and Josh Inglis got out cheaply. They were under a lot of pressure from that moment on. The middle order of San Francisco Unicorns came good as Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan smashed 59 and 44 runs respectively to help San Francisco Unicorns get to a strong total of 148 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Seattle Orcas lost Ruben Clinton quite early into the innings. Dewald Brevis played like a champion and he smashed 56 runs off 36 balls. He instilled the hope for a successful chase. Nicholas Pooran also supported him well, he scored 26 runs but consumed too many balls to get going. It cost the team dearly. The rest of the middle order batters including Romario Shepherd and Monank Patel failed terribly and despite the efforts of Heath Richards, who smashed 24 off 13 balls, Seattle Orcas failed to achieve the target and fell short by 3 runs in the end.\n\nCurrent Form Seattle Orcas:\n\nSeattle Orcas are currently placed at the bottom most position on points table with 1 win and 4 losses to their credit.\n\nThe top run scorer for Seattle Orcas in the Major League Cricket is Ryan Rickelton with 225 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Seattle Orcas in the Major League Cricket is Cameron Gannon with 9 scalps under his belt.\n\nSeattle Orcas have lost their previous match against LA Knight Riders by 4 wickets.\n\nSeattle Orcas batted first and they posted a total of 142 for 6 in 20 overs. Except for Ryan Rickelton, no other batter showed any promise whatsoever. The big names like Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen and Aaron Jones, all failed to get going. Rickelton smashed 89 off 52 balls but he barely got any support at the other end. Once he got out in the 19th over, it was all clear that Orcas will not reach a decent total. They were littled and only scored 142 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Sunil Narine as usual got out cheaply. Jason Roy tried his best to take control but he consumed too many balls for his knock of 27 runs. A real game changing innings was played by Unmukt Chand, who smashed 62 runs off 47 balls. He was aided by the lower order batters who contributed healthily and helped LA Knight Riders get over the line in the 20th over with 4 wickets in hand.\n\nBatting Stats T20\n\nLet’s have a look at the squads:\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nPat Cummins, Qais Ahmad, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Henry, Mackenzie Harvey, Lungi Ngidi, Brody Couch, Tajinder Singh, Josh Inglis, Matthew Wade, Jahmar Hamilton, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Smit Patel, David White, Corey Anderson, Finn Allen, Carmi le RouxLiam Plunkett, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Haris Rauf, Shadab Khan\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nNandre Burger, Harmeet Singh, Obed McCoy, Nathan Ellis, Shubham Ranjane, Andrew Tye, Angelo Perera, Hayden Walsh, Nauman Anwar, Michael Bracewell, Dwaine Pretorius, Nisarg Patel, Shimron Hetmyer, Cameron Gannon, Dasun Shanaka, Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen, Shehan Jayasuriya, Wayne Parnell, Quinton de Kock, Ryan Rickelton, Imad Wasim, Phani Simhardi\n\nWicket Takers T20",

However, Finn Allen's explosive 77 off 30 balls took the San Francisco Unicorns to a comfortable six-wicket win.\n\nWith this victory, the San Francisco Unicorns remain in second place on the points table with nine points from six matches, while the Seattle Orcas have been officially eliminated from the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nAlready qualified for the playoffs, the San Francisco Unicorns began their run chase of 153 runs at a blistering pace.

He scored 77 off 30 balls, leaving San Francisco at 98/2 after eight overs.\n\nThe Unicorns then lost two more wickets in consecutive overs. Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed for 10 off 16 balls in the 13th over, followed by Sherfane Rutherford in the 14th, who scored 17 off 8 balls. However, Josh Inglis and Corey Anderson guided San Francisco to a comfortable six-wicket win with 34 balls to spare.\n\nIn a must-win game, the Seattle Orcas faced a disastrous start after being invited to bat first. They lost both openers in the very first over: Ryan Rickelton was caught by Finn Allen on the first ball, and Aaron Jones was trapped LBW by Carmi le Roux.\n\nDespite an early setback, Seattle managed to score 48 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to an aggressive counter-attack by Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya. They added 34 runs in the last two overs of the Powerplay, bringing the score to 48/2.\n\nDe Kock reached his half-century off 28 balls by the 10th over. Alongside Jayasuriya, he added 31 runs off Pat Cummins' first two overs, pushing Seattle to 98/2 after 11 overs. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the 12th over as both de Kock (62 off 33) and Jayasuriya (31 off 33) were dismissed in quick succession by Brody Couch.\n\nHassan Khan then delivered a decisive blow to Seattle Orcas, as he struck thrice in his two consecutive overs. He dismissed Heinrich Klaasen (8 off 8) in the 14th over, and Harmeet Singh (3 off 7) and Keemo Paul (0 off 1) in the 16th over, reducing Seattle to 116/7.\n\nIt was Shubham Ranjane, who came to the rescue as he played a crucial unbeaten knock of 26 runs off 25 balls, helping Seattle post a total of 152/7 in their 20 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-0 (Ryan Rickelton - 0.1 ov), 2-1 (Aaron Jones - 0.3 ov), 3-98 (Quinton de Kock - 11.1 ov), 4-99 (Shehan Jayasuriya - 11.4 ov), 5-108 (Heinrich Klaasen - 13.1 ov), 6-116 (Harmeet Singh - 15.5 ov), 7-116 (Keemo Paul - 15.6 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Fall of wickets: 1-84 (Matthew Short - 6.4 ov), 2-98 (Finn Allen - 7.5 ov), 3-124 (Sanjay Krishnamurthi - 12.1 ov), 4-144 (Sherfane Rutherford - 13.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen\n\nMatthew Short\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nJosh Inglis(WK)\n\nSherfane Rutherford\n\nCorey Anderson(C)\n\nHassan Khan\n\nPat Cummins\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nCarmi le Roux\n\nBrody Couch\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nRyan Rickelton\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nAaron Jones\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nKeemo Paul\n\nImad Wasim\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nLungi Ngidi\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Sunday, July 21, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: San Francisco Unicorns elected to bowl",

However, Finn Allen’s explosive 77 off 30 balls propelled the San Francisco Unicorns to a comfortable six-wicket win.\n\nWith this victory, the San Francisco Unicorns remain in second place on the points table with nine points from six matches, while the Seattle Orcas have been officially eliminated from the second season of Major League Cricket.\n\nAlready qualified for the playoffs, the San Francisco Unicorns began their run chase of 153 runs at a blistering pace. They scored 79 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to Finn Allen’s 21-ball fifty. He struck 26 runs in the fifth over, bowled by Lungi Ngidi, including two sixes and three fours.\n\nMatthew Short was dismissed by Imad Wasim in the seventh over after scoring 19 off 14 balls. Allen continued his aggressive batting, hitting two sixes off Harmeet Singh before being caught by Ryan Rickelton on the fifth ball of the eighth over. He scored 77 off 30 balls, leaving San Francisco at 98/2 after eight overs.\n\nThe Unicorns lost two more wickets in consecutive overs: Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed for 10 off 16 balls in the 13th over, followed by Sherfane Rutherford in the 14th over, who scored 17 off 8 balls. However, Josh Inglis and Corey Anderson guided San Francisco to a comfortable six-wicket win with 34 balls to spare.\n\nIn a must-win game, the Seattle Orcas suffered a disastrous start after being invited to bat first. They lost both openers in the very first over: Ryan Rickelton was caught by Finn Allen on the first ball, and Aaron Jones was trapped LBW by Carmi le Roux.\n\nDespite this early setback, Seattle managed to score 48 runs in the Powerplay, thanks to an aggressive counter-attack by Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya. They added 34 runs in the last two overs of the Powerplay, bringing the score to 48/2.\n\nDe Kock reached his half-century off 28 balls by the 10th over. Alongside Jayasuriya, he added 31 runs off Pat Cummins’ first two overs, pushing Seattle to 98/2 after 11 overs. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the 12th over as both de Kock (62 off 33) and Jayasuriya (31 off 33) were dismissed in quick succession by Brody Couch.\n\nHassan Khan then delivered a decisive blow to the Seattle Orcas, striking thrice in his two consecutive overs.

    "body": "While seven other squad members are in the US competing in the Major League Cricket tournament, Temba Bavuma and Co will be getting together for the first time since the New Year’s Test at Newlands.\n\nTEST captain Temba Bavuma will be alongside Wiaan Mulder, Matthew Breetzke, Tony de Zorzi, Lungi Ngidi, Kyle Verreynne, Dane Paterson and Tristan Stubbs at Kingsmead Stadium in Durban this week as the first day of the pre-Caribbean tour camp gets under way.\n\nWhile seven other squad members are in the US competing in the Major League Cricket tournament, Bavuma and Co will be getting together for the first time since the New Year’s Test at Newlands.\n\nComing on the back of a lot of white-ball cricket recently, the objectives of the camp will be for the players to polish their red-ball skills, and remind themselves of the team’s philosophy.\n\nDespite the Proteas’ 2-0 Test series victory during their last visit to the Caribbean three years ago and the West Indies’ innings defeat to England in the first Test at Lord’s earlier this week, they are a formidable unit in their backyard.\n\n“We’re looking forward to a competitive West Indies team,” Bavuma said.\n\n“About three years ago, their bowling attack put us under pressure. I think the Duke ball in those conditions does talk a bit, it does move around and they have the resources to do that. As inexperienced as some of their players will be, we’ll still need to be on our A-game in all disciplines.\n\n“It will also be a good challenge where we also have newer faces, some inexperience within our team, to see how those guys go about their international careers within the red-ball space. That’s something that we’re looking forward to.\n\n“Every series is an important one. We don’t have the privilege of looking too far ahead with us being placed at No.7 (in the World Test Championship). It’s for us to look to play our best cricket in those conditions and take the confidence from that.\n\n“We know that winning breeds confidence and it can become a habit as well.\n\n“If we can start doing that in the West Indies, that would be good for us. But again, we’re not looking too far ahead. We want to get there, understanding that we haven’t played Test cricket for a while.\n\n“It’s about us reminding ourselves of our philosophy as a team, building that winning culture again and carrying that throughout the season.”\n\nWith Dean Elgar having called time on his career during the drawn series against India earlier this year, this means Bavuma is now the senior batter within the team with 97 innings under the belt.\n\nBavuma feels no added pressure.\n\n“It’s just an awareness in terms of knowing that you’re the senior statesman within the team and not an added pressure or anything like that,” he said.\n\n“I will still try to fulfil my role as a batter and put the team in winning positions. Nothing is going to change from that.”\n\nWith the likes of Aiden Markram and some of the Proteas T20 World Cup finalists set to join the Test side before the start of the Windies series, there will be some confidence that they will bring into the Test space.\n\n“There’s a lot of confidence that will emanate within the group seeing the success of the boys in the T20 side,” he said.\n\n“We’ll take the confidence that will come with the guys who were at the World Cup and have them lead things from that perspective.\n\n“But I think within the Test space we’re not as far ahead as the T20 players are and even the 50-over space. There are a couple of hurdles that we need to get through as a Test team.\n\n“We’re still finding ourselves, if we’re being honest. That’s really where our focus is within the Test team.”\n\nThe camp will run until Friday. The first Test is scheduled to start on August 7 in Port of Spain. It will be preceded by a warm-up match, starting on July 31.",

    "body": "Seattle Orcas (SOR) cricketer Shehan Jayasuriya took a spectacular one-handed catch during the match against the San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. Shehan Jayasuriya's excellent catch sent San Francisco Unicorns batter Sanjay Krishnamurthi to the pavilion in the recent game.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns opted to bowl first at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Sunday, July 21 (India time). The Seattle Orcas scored 152 runs for the loss of seven wickets in 20 overs. Shehan Jayasuriya struggled to score runs as he was dismissed after scoring 31 runs off 33 deliveries with four boundaries.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns chased down the target with six wickets and more than five overs to spare. Opener Finn Allen scored 77 runs off 30 deliveries, including eight boundaries and six maximums. The Orcas recorded their fifth loss out of six matches in the tournament and are at the bottom of the six-team table.\n\nWatch: Shehan Jayasuriya Takes Catch of MLC 2024\n\nDuring the first ball of the 13th over of the San Francisco Unicorns' innings, Sanjay Krishnamurthi attempted a drive against a slower, wider delivery from left-arm spinner Harmeet Singh. Sanjay Krishnamurthi connected the ball but didn't get the desired elevation to go over the fielder inside the circle.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya was positioned at short cover on the field. The Sri Lankan international made a perfectly timed full-length jump to catch the ball with his outstretched right hand. Sanjay Krishnamurthi was dismissed after scoring 10 runs off 16 balls with one boundary.\n\nWe Have Been Poor In This Season - Heinrich Klaasen\n\nThe Seattle Orcas were eliminated from the MLC 2024 after their heavy defeat to the San Francisco Unicorns. The runner-ups from the inaugural season have won only one of their first six matches. They will face the Texas Super Kings (TSK) in their final match at the Grand Prairie Stadium on Wednesday, July 24.\n\nOrcas skipper Heinrich Klaasen expressed his disappointment, noting their poor batting and lack of firepower. Klaasen acknowledged that their total was 15-20 runs short, which ultimately cost them the match.\n\n\"Disappointing, we were in the final last year, this year we didn't bat well, not a lot of firepower. The bowlers were good and did what best they could do. A bit under par, maybe 15-20 runs short and that cost us in the end. We've been poor in this season, disappointing for the franchise and the owners,\" Klaasen said.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen's team has struggled with form and finding the right combination this season. Shehan Jayasuriya has performed decently in the middle order, with his standout moment being a remarkable ramp shot against Haris Rauf in an earlier match against the San Francisco Unicorns in the MLC 2024.",

After winning the opening game of the season against the Seattle Orcas, they have lost three matches and one was washed out. This has put them fifth on the table with three points in five matches. Having not found a win in four games, MI needs to win this one to stay in contention for a top-four finish.\n\nOn the other hand, the San Francisco Unicorns are currently in the top four, in third place to be precise despite having five points in four matches.

Fast bowlers will find some movement, especially early in the inning.\n\nThe ball starts sticking to the pitch as the match proceeds, which might help medium pacers with a lot of variations. Quality spinners too can muddle the middle overs.\n\nMI New York Vs San Francisco Unicorns Weather Report\n\nThe skies will be cloudy with some chance of rain, but not too much, the winds will also hardly pick up.\n\nIt will be a warm and pleasant evening, with temperatures in the mid 20s.

So instead, we will look back at the recent record of these two teams, which has been fairly similar in this tournament. It is clear that both these sides do not compete with the better team this season, seeing how they have lost most of their matches by a big margin.\n\nIn their game earlier this season, the MI New York won their one and only match, this team also seems to have a better bowling attack as a whole. But, the Knight Riders have a better spin attack, giving them a distinct advantage on this dry track.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns also seem to have a better batting order, making them the favorites to win this one.\n\nMI New York Vs San Francisco Unicorns Prediction: San Francisco Unicorns will defeat MI New York in the 1st Match of Major League Cricket 2024",

There was a massive injury scare that happened during the San Francisco Unicorns versus Seattle Orcas match.\n\nThe incident occurred when Carmi Le Roux, who was bowling to Ryan Rickelton, was hit on his head. The ball came towards the bowler at high speed and he couldn’t put up his hands on time and was hit on his head.\n\nThe rest of the players, including Ryan Rickelton, ran up to the bowler to check on his well-being. The bowler was badly injured as there was a lot of blood on his face. It was a gory sight to watch but the one positive that came out of it was that Carmi Le Roux was able to walk off the field on his own accord.\n\nMI New York on the verge of elimination\n\nMeanwhile, defending champions MI New York took on San Francisco Unicorn in a massive game on Thursday night. At the end of the game, the Unicorns managed to hold onto a three run win over the MI side.\n\nBatting first, the Unicorns scored 148/7 with skipper Corey Anderson top scoring with 59 not out. The knock came off 44 balls with four boundaries and two sixes as he added a crucial 87 runs for the 6th wicket with Hassan Khan who scored 44.\n\nChasing 149 to win, MI lost Ruben Clinton early for a duck. Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran then added 57 runs for the 2nd wicket. Dewald Brevis scored 56 runs from 36 balls before he was out to Brody Couch.\n\nMatthew Short was the best bowler with 3/27 from his 4 overs as he combined well with Hassan Khan and Brody Couch to help the Unicorns win by 3 runs. The result will have a massive bearing on the MI side who are struggling at the bottom half of the table and could miss out on the playoffs.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the game, Kieron Pollard the MI skipper said “I believe it was the middle period of 15 balls, we didn't get any boundaries and let them get back. But I think we still had a chance and didn't take it. I thought we bowled well to have them at 33 for 5, Boult bowled well, but they had a good partnership to get around 148. I think we should have restricted them to 120, I don't want to blame anyone, luck wasn't on our side at various stages of the tournament”",

The southpaw, had intended to play the ball straight, but the shot ended up going directly towards the bowler.\n\nFortunately, le Roux was able to walk off the field under his own power, much to the relief of the medical staff and spectators.\n\nWith le Roux unavailable, former New Zealand and current USA all-rounder Corey Anderson stepped in to complete the over as the San Francisco Unicorns defended their total of 165 against the Seattle Orcas. Despite le Roux’s absence, the Unicorns were able to restrict the Orcas to just 142 runs.\n\nVeteran England pacer Liam Plunkett delivered an impressive performance, claiming 3/26 in his 4-over spell to emerge as the standout bowler.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas’ misfortunes continued as they suffered another defeat, this time to the Los Angeles Knight Riders, just two days after their previous loss. The back-to-back defeats have left the Orcas languishing at the bottom of the Major League Cricket (MLC) season two table – a stark contrast to their table-topping performance in the previous season.\n\nThe Orcas have only managed one win in their last five matches, putting them in a precarious position.

    "body": "Washington Freedom continued their winning streak, securing a 42-run victory over the Texas Super Kings to remain at the top of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket points table.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nTexas Super Kings 164/10 (19.5 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom 206/5 (20 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom won by 42 runs.\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas witnessed a dominant performance, as Rachin Ravindra’s four wickets bowled out the Texan team for 164 runs. However, led by Faf du Plessis’ quickfire half-century – the fastest by a batter this season -- the Texas Super Kings had a strong start to their run-chase.\n\nDu Plessis propelled his team to 76 runs in the powerplay. However, Washington's bowlers executed a brilliant comeback in the middle overs. Jasdeep Singh, Glenn Maxwell, and Ravindra shared the 10 wickets among them, but it was Lockie Ferguson's crucial over to Du Plessis after the powerplay that turned the tide. Lockie conceded only 2 wides in that over, eventually leading to Faf's dismissal.\n\nSoon after, the Super Kings' batting lineup crumbled, losing 4 wickets for just 15 runs between overs 7.1 and 11.6, ultimately costing them the match. While Calvin Savage managed to strike a few powerful blows towards the end, it only served to narrow the margin of defeat.\n\nEarlier in the clash, Washington Freedom posted a formidable target of 206 for the Texas Super Kings. The fireworks began early with Travis Head delivering a scintillating performance in the powerplay. He hammered 53 runs off just 22 balls, dismantling the seamers with ease and giving Washington a flying start.\n\nAs spin was introduced, the scoring rate slowed slightly, thanks to some purchase on the used pitch. However, Maxwell played a pivotal role in maintaining the momentum, contributing crucial runs in the middle overs. Towards the tail end of the innings, Pienaar provided a valuable boost, ensuring a strong finish for the team.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Smith (57) also continued his consistent performances, nearly batting through the entire innings and securing a well-earned fifty. His steady presence at the crease anchored the Washington innings and kept the scoreboard ticking.\n\nThe start given by the two Australian batters was more than enough for the middle order of the Washington-based side to take on the rest of the bowlers. Maxwell (34) and Obus Pienaar (33) both scored crucial runs to ensure their team put up a tough target that the Texas Super Kings were eventually unable to chase down.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-59 (Travis Head - 4.3 ov), 2-74 (Andries Gous - 5.6 ov), 3-79 (Rachin Ravindra - 6.5 ov), 4-137 (Glenn Maxwell - 13.5 ov), 5-186 (Steven Smith - 18.5 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-37 (Devon Conway - 3.3 ov), 2-90 (Aaron Hardie - 7.1 ov), 3-96 (Joshua Tromp - 9.4 ov), 4-98 (Faf du Plessis - 10.5 ov), 5-105 (Milind Kumar - 11.6 ov), 6-132 (Marcus Stoinis - 14.6 ov), 7-141 (Dwayne Bravo - 15.5 ov), 8-161 (Mohammad Mohsin - 17.5 ov), 9-163 (Noor Ahmad - 19.3 ov), 10-164 (Calvin Savage - 19.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nNoor Ahmad\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nTravis Head\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nAmila Aponso\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nJasdeep Singh\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Saturday, July 20, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas",

Washington Freedom have won 5 out of their 6 matches, as the fixture against Texas Super Kings earlier in the tournament was abandoned due to rain.\n\nWashington Freedom Vs Texas Super Kings MLC 2024 Match 17 Highlights\n\nElecting to bowl first, the Texas Super Kings did not do justice to their decision, as the in-form opening pair of Steve Smith and Travis Head were off to a flying start, and the duo notched up 59 runs in 4.2 overs before the latter fell prey to Noor Ahmed. The partnership was indeed, a hilarious one, as Travis Head scored 53 runs out of those 59 runs, whereas, Steve Smith faced merely 5 balls, and scored 4 runs.\n\nTexas Super Kings made a mini-comeback of their own, as Travis Head's departure was followed by quick dismissals of Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra inside the next 20 runs, ad Washington Freedom were reeling at 79/3 in 7 overs.\n\nThe small stutter did not halt the scoring rate, as the Australian duo of Glenn Maxwell and Steve Smith notched up a 58-run stand to resurrect the innings before Glenn Maxwell departed on the score of 138. Steve Smith held his guard until the last phase of the innings, as his excellent half-century enabled the Freedom to cross the 200-run mark.\n\nIn reply, the in-form Faf Du Plessis announced his arrival on the pitch in some style, as the Proteas legend unleashed his wrath on Washington Freedom bowlers, and TSK were 76/1 at the end of the powerplay. What followed later was a downhill journey for the side, as wickets fell in quick succession and intervals, and the target of 207 seemed even more improbable.\n\nThe Faf Du Plessis-led side bundled out for 164, as four wickets from Rachin Ravindra, and three wickets each from Glenn Maxwell and Jasdeep Singh saw Washington Freedom home in a winning cause.",

Despite a shaky start, Anderson's composure helped his team post a competitive total of 148/7. Hassan Khan's valuable 44 complemented Anderson's effort, particularly their crucial 87-run partnership which salvaged the innings after early setbacks.\n\nThe Unicorns' innings began poorly, with Noshtush Kenjige wreaking havoc by dismissing Finn Allen (0) and Matthew Short (4) early on. Further losses of Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis left the team struggling at 28/4 by the end of the powerplay.\n\nSherfane Rutherford's brief 15 gave some momentum before being run out. Rashid Khan's dismissal of Hassan Khan in the 17th over and Trent Boult's double strikes kept MI New York in contention. However, Anderson's steady half-century ensured the Unicorns had a defensible score.\n\nIn response, MI New York's chase had a turbulent start as Matthew Short claimed the wicket of Ruben Clinton (0) in the second over. Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran then steadied the ship, taking MI New York to 31/1 at the end of the powerplay. Brevis was particularly impressive, reaching his half-century in just 32 balls with an aggressive display against Pat Cummins.\n\nDespite Brevis' heroics, MI New York's middle order crumbled under pressure. Brody Couch's twin strikes to remove Brevis and captain Kieron Pollard (4) shifted the momentum. Matthew Short further dented MI New York's chase by dismissing Pooran (26).\n\nAs the run rate escalated, Romario Shepherd and Monank Patel fell cheaply, leaving Rashid Khan and Heath Richards with a daunting task. Cummins' tight 19th over, conceding just five runs, was instrumental in tightening the screws.\n\nThe final over, bowled by Haris Rauf, saw a valiant effort from Heath Richards, who nearly pulled off a miraculous chase by hitting two sixes. However, his dismissal on the last ball sealed a dramatic win for the Unicorns.\n\nThe thrilling contest showcased exceptional performances on both sides but ultimately highlighted the importance of composure under pressure. Corey Anderson's stability with the bat and Pat Cummins' crucial bowling proved decisive in a match that kept spectators on the edge of their seats until the final delivery.\n\nBrief Scores\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns 148/7 (Corey Anderson 59*, Hassan Khan 44; Noshtush Kenjige 2/13, Trent Boult 2/35) beat MI New York 145/7 (Dewald Brevis 56, Nicholas Pooran 26; Matthew Short 3/27, Brody Couch 2/27)",

He comes into this game after hitting seven fours and six sixes in the last match.\n\nSOR Team Bowling\n\nSeattle Orcas’ bowling unit took six wickets in their last game and they will need to improve on that if they are to stop the strong batting line up of San Francisco Unicorns in this fixture.

Here’s a breakdown to help you decide who might emerge victorious:\n\nUnicorns with a Slight Edge\n\nWhile both teams haven’t exactly set the tournament on fire, the Unicorns (currently ranked 4th) appear to have a slight advantage over the struggling Orcas (anchored at the bottom). Here’s why:\n\nRecent Form: The Unicorns might have only one win in three matches, but their Net Run Rate (-0.631) is significantly better than the Orcas’ (-1.007). This indicates closer contests for the Unicorns.\n\nBatting Power: Players like Finn Allen, Corey Anderson, and Sherfane Rutherford in the Unicorns’ batting line-up pose a serious threat, especially early on.\n\nOrcas Can’t be Counted Out\n\nHowever, writing off the Orcas would be a mistake. Here’s why they might pull off an upset:\n\nHome Advantage: The match takes place at Church Street Park, Morrisville, which could potentially favor the Orcas if they’re familiar with the pitch conditions.\n\nBowling X-Factor: The likes of Nauman Anwar, Harmeet Singh, and Zaman Khan in the Orcas’ bowling attack have the potential to disrupt the Unicorns’ batting rhythm.\n\nMatch Prediction\n\nWhile the Unicorns seem to have a slight edge on paper, expect a close encounter. The final result might hinge on individual brilliance and handling pressure situations. Cricketwebs predicts a narrow victory for the Unicorns (winning probability: 69%), but the Orcas have the potential to cause an upset.\n\nWinner: San Francisco Unicorns Will Win\n\nRemember: Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties.

    "body": "Right then, that will be it from us for this contest. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. The action continues at the Major League Cricket, 2024. The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the Washington Freedom in Match 17 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas. That game will be played on July 20th and will start at 6.00 am IST (12.30 am GMT). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nThe skipper of San Francisco Unicorns is also the Player of the Match for his sublime knock. He says that he is pretty happy with the win. Adds that they bat deep and credits Hassan Khan who batted superbly today. Mentions that they need to pick the aggressive options and find the boundary when they can. Shares that he and Hassan Khan spoke well through the middle and got ahead of the game in the latter stages with the bat. Adds that he is happy to perform against the MINY side. Ends by sharing that they were under par with the bat but the guys showed a good fight and it shows the character of the team.\n\nThe losing skipper of MI New York, Kieron Pollard says the middle phase with the ball was the one where the opposition got back in the game but they had it covered for a long while with the bat but they gave it away in the end. Adds that around 120 was what they had in mind after their bowling in the first 10 overs but the opposition batted well and posted above 145 making things difficult for them. Says that one has to congratulate the opposition and not try to take credit away from them as they played better on the day. Says that he hasn't done justice to the side himself with his batting not firing and that has cost the team for the majority of the tournament. Closes by saying that the batting unit has not done well throughout the tournament and overall as a batting unit they have let the fans and franchise down but they still have one game to go and they'll look to play that well.\n\nMatthew Short is up for a chat. He says it's a huge win as MI New York is a quality side and they have some brilliant players of T20 format. Credits Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan for that superb partnership that kept them in the game. Mentions that the top order has done well so far apart from today and the middle order stepped up when the side needed them the most and that's a good sign for any side.\n\nEarlier today, the San Francisco Unicorns opted to bat first and posted a fighting score of 148 for 7 in their 20 overs. The Unicorns were reeling at 33 for 5 but the partnership of 87 between skipper Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan (44 off 35) brought them back in the game. Corey Anderson remained unbeaten on 59 off just 37 and played a crucial hand to get his side out of trouble. Nosthush Kenjige and Trent Boult took two each for the MI New York side while Shepherd and Rashid Khan chipped in with one apiece. MI New York have slumped to their fourth loss of the season and have just a game in hand.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns started well with the ball but lost their way in the middle phase of the innings. They, however, came back strong and got into the winning position. Brody Couch and Matthew Short shared five wickets among them while Haris Rauf and Hassan Khan chipped with one apiece. San Francisco Unicorns will be delighted with the win as they came back from behind and took the victory from the jaws of defeat. San Francisco Unicorns have qualified for the playoffs and moved to second position in the table.\n\nPhew! What a cliffhanger we've witnessed in Dallas! San Francisco Unicorns held their nerves and won this game by 3 runs in the end. They become the second team after the Washington Freedom to book a place in the playoffs. Chasing a competitive score of 149 for the win, MI New York lost an early wicket of Ruben Clinton but Pooran and Brevis stuck around and added 77 for the second wicket. Dewald Brevis made an attacking fifty and departed on 56 off 36. The wicket of Brevis put the brakes on scoring for MI New York and they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Rashid Khan and Heath Richards swung their bats at the backend but failed to take their team over the line.\n\nW\n\nOvers15.4\n\nScore104 - 5\n\nMatthew Short to Romario Shepherd, HOLES OUT! The plan comes off for the Unicorns and Matthew Short gets his third wicket of the match. Comes from round the wicket and bowls it a touch shorter, sliding into the middle. Romario Shepherd looks to bang bang but does not get the desired connection. He gets the height but not distance and gets caught by Hassan Khan at the deep mid-wicket boundary. MI New York have lost half their side now.",

The close contest highlighted the competitive nature of the league, with the Unicorns managing to secure a hard-fought victory.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nMI New York vs San Francisco Unicorns, Match 16\n\nMI New York 145/7 (20 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns 148/7 (20 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns won by 3 runs.\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns secured a thrilling three-run victory over MI New York in a nail-biting encounter of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas.\n\nKey performances included Corey Anderson’s (59*) steady half-century for the Unicorns, Dewald Brevis’ (56) explosive fifty for MI New York, and Pat Cummins’ crucial 19th over for the Unicorns, which helped them defend their total of 148/7, despite Heath Richards’ (23) valiant effort in the final over for MI New York.\n\nMI New York had a staggered start to the run chase as they lost Ruben Clinton (0) to Matthew Short as early as the second over. Opener Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran (26) saw out the powerplay, with MI New York at 31/1.\n\nWhile the required run rate had crept up, MI New York were set for a comfortable run chase with nine wickets in hand. Brevis looked to pick up the pace after the powerplay and found boundaries at will. The 21-year-old brought up his half-century in the ninth over, smashing Pat Cummins for a six and a four to reach the milestone in just 32 balls.\n\nIn the very next over, Brody Couch bagged the crucial wicket of Brevis with the score reading 79/2. Captain Pollard (4) was the next man to fall, trapped LBW by Couch as well. With the required run rate rising, Matthew Short made a vital breakthrough with the wicket of Pooran in the 14th over.\n\nRomario Shepherd (7) and Monank Patel (5) both fell with minimal contributions, leaving MI New York’s Rashid Khan (14*) and Heath Richards with a steep target in the final four overs of the game. Pat Cummins bowled a crucial 19th over, giving away only 5 runs, which was vital for his team’s defense of the total. In the final over, Heath Richards nearly chased the 20 runs needed with two maximums, but Haris Rauf managed to dismiss him on the final delivery, securing a three-run victory for the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns had a dismal start to their innings. In quick succession, they lost Finn Allen (0) and Matthew Short (4) to the bowling of Noshtush Kenjige, while Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis were also sent back to the pavilion early. By the end of the powerplay, the Unicorns were languishing at 28/4.\n\nSherfane Rutherford (15) struck three boundaries before he was run out in the seventh over. It was Hassan Khan (44) and Corey Anderson who executed the repair job for the San Francisco Unicorns. The pair put on 87 runs in 58 balls, with Corey Anderson leading the way with a 33-ball half-century.\n\nHassan Khan fell in the 17th over when he was cleaned up by the crafty Rashid Khan. Pat Cummins (13) joined Corey Anderson and made a brief contribution before becoming Boult’s second scalp of the day. The San Francisco Unicorns finished on 148/7 in 20 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-2 (Finn Allen - 0.3 ov), 2-7 (Sanjay Krishnamurthi - 1.5 ov), 3-7 (Matthew Short - 2.2 ov), 4-19 (Josh Inglis - 5.2 ov), 5-33 (Sherfane Rutherford - 6.6 ov), 6-120 (Hassan Khan - 16.4 ov), 7-145 (Pat Cummins - 19.4 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Fall of wickets: 1-2 (Ruben Clinton - 1.5 ov), 2-79 (Dewald Brevis - 9.6 ov), 3-88 (Kieron Pollard - 12.4 ov), 4-94 (Nicholas Pooran - 13.4 ov), 5-104 (Romario Shepherd - 15.4 ov), 6-108 (Monank Patel - 16.1 ov), 7-145 (Heath Richards - 19.6 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nMI New York\n\nRuben Clinton\n\nMonank Patel\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nDewald Brevis\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nRomario Shepherd\n\nSunny Patel\n\nHeath Richards\n\nRashid Khan\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nTrent Boult\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen\n\nMatthew Short\n\nJosh Inglis(WK)\n\nCorey Anderson(C)\n\nSherfane Rutherford\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nHassan Khan\n\nPat Cummins\n\nLiam Plunkett\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nBrody Couch\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Friday, July 19, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: San Francisco Unicorns elected to bat",

With their third win of the season in five matches, San Francisco became the second team to qualify for the MLC 2024 playoffs after Washington Freedom.

Batting first, SFU faced early troubles and lost wickets in clumps as they found themselves five wickets down for just 33 runs.

    "body": "oi-Avinash Sharma\n\nMorrisville, July 18: A crucial half-century from Unmukt Chand (62) ensured the Los Angeles Knight Riders defeated the Seattle Orcas by four wickets with five balls to spare in match number 15 of the Major League Cricket 2024 at Church Street Park, Morrisville on Wednesday (July 17).\n\nRyan Rickelton's (89) breathtaking 52-ball knock for the Seattle Orcas was ultimately in vain. LAKR thus secured their second win in six games and now find themselves in the fourth spot in the points table, with Washington Freedom qualified for the playoffs.\n\nChasing a below-par score, the Los Angeles Knight Riders orchestrated a comfortable run chase. Sunil Narine's (8) lean run continued when Spencer Johnson dismissed him in the second over, while Jason Roy (26) and Unmukt Chand (62) went on to build an important partnership. At the end of the powerplay, the Los Angeles Knight Riders were 47/1.\n\nThe 58-run alliance between Roy and Chand was derailed by Harmeet Singh in the 10th over. Unmukt Chand went on to bring up his half-century in 38 deliveries, comprising three sixes and three fours. In the 17th over, Chand fell to Harmeet Singh, but at 120/5, the Knight Riders were in a strong position.\n\nNitish Kumar (12) and Saif Badar (18*) came together for a brief partnership before Andre Russell (10) made a quick contribution to ensure the Los Angeles Knight Riders secured victory with balls to spare. Harmeet Singh (2/27) and Cameron Gannon (2/35) were the pick of the Orcas' bowling efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Seattle Orcas suffered an early setback when Shehan Jayasuriya (2) was dismissed by Corne Dry. Soon after, Quinton de Kock (0) was run out without troubling the scorers.\n\nOpener Ryan Rickelton continued his fine form and quickly accumulated runs as he was joined by Heinrich Klaasen. By the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 36/2, with Rickelton having scored 27 of those runs.\n\nIn the ninth over, Rickelton shifted into another gear, hammering Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a 22-run over. Remarkably, no other batsman besides Rickelton had scored a boundary for the Orcas in the first 10 overs.\n\nRickelton brought up his half-century in just 28 deliveries, featuring five maximums and four boundaries. Meanwhile, Klaasen (23) played a more guarded knock, providing stability at the other end until he was unfortunately run out in the 12th over at 90/3.\n\nWhile Rickelton continued to flourish, striking another six and four boundaries, the lack of support around him meant the Orcas failed to build any more concrete partnerships.\n\nAaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were castled by the experienced Sunil Narine and Andre Russell before Rickelton would eventually perish just shy of a century, dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over. The Seattle Orcas finished on 142/6 in 20 overs.",

Besides Pooran, Monank Patel and Romario Shepherd could also be good picks.\n\nRashid Khan will be a great choice as he will be potent on this track with the ball and can also contribute with the bat.\n\nTrent Boult's potential with the new ball makes him a good choice for the fantasy contests.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nMatthew Short and Finn Allen are the in form batters for the Unicorns, and these two would be the safer picks from SFU's batting.\n\nLiam Plunkett, Hassan Khan and Pat Cummins could be the best choices from the Unicorns bowling attack.\n\nNY vs SF Winner Prediction\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns look like a much more balanced and well-rounded team, and as per their performance this season, they are the favourites to win the game.\n\nNY vs SF Top Player Picks\n\nNicholas Pooran (NY)\n\nMLC 2024 Stats: 111 Runs in 4 Matches\n\nThe West Indian keeper batter is the leading run-scorer for MI New York and has scored 111 runs in three matches at an average of 37.00 and a strike rate of 144.16.

Key performances included Corey Anderson's (59*) steady half-century for the Unicorns, Dewald Brevis' (56) explosive fifty for MI New York, and Pat Cummins' crucial 19th over for the Unicorns, which helped them defend their total of 148/7, despite Heath Richards' (23) valiant effort in the final over for MI New York. MLC 2024: Ryan Rickelton’s Heroics Goes in Vain As LA Knight Riders Seal Four-Wicket Win Against Seattle Orcas.\n\nMI New York had a staggered start to the run chase as they lost Ruben Clinton (0) to Matthew Short as early as the second over. Opener Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran (26) saw out the powerplay, with MI New York at 31/1. While the required run rate had crept up, MI New York were set for a comfortable run chase with nine wickets in hand.\n\nBrevis looked to pick up the pace after the powerplay and found boundaries at will. The 21-year-old brought up his half-century in the ninth over, smashing Pat Cummins for a six and a four to reach the milestone in just 32 balls. In the very next over, Brody Couch bagged the crucial wicket of Brevis with the score reading 79/2. Captain Pollard (4) was the next man to fall, trapped LBW by Couch as well.\n\nWith the required run rate rising, Matthew Short made a vital breakthrough with the wicket of Pooran in the 14th over. Romario Shepherd (7) and Monank Patel (5) both fell with minimal contributions, leaving MI New York's Rashid Khan (14*) and Heath Richards with a steep target in the final four overs of the game.\n\nPat Cummins bowled a crucial 19th over, giving away only 5 runs, which was vital for his team's defense of the total. In the final over, Heath Richards nearly chased the 20 runs needed with two maximums, but Haris Rauf managed to dismiss him on the final delivery, securing a three-run victory for the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns had a dismal start to their innings. In quick succession, they lost Finn Allen (0) and Matthew Short (4) to the bowling of Noshtush Kenjige, while Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis were also sent back to the pavilion early. By the end of the powerplay, the Unicorns were languishing at 28/4. MI New York Suffers Huge 94-Run Loss Against Washington Freedom in MLC 2024.\n\nSherfane Rutherford (15) struck three boundaries before he was run out in the seventh over. It was Hassan Khan (44) and Corey Anderson who executed the repair job for the San Francisco Unicorns. The pair put on 87 runs in 58 balls, with Corey Anderson leading the way with a 33-ball half-century.\n\nHassan Khan fell in the 17th over when he was cleaned up by the crafty Rashid Khan. Pat Cummins (13) joined Corey Anderson and made a brief contribution before becoming Boult's second scalp of the day. The San Francisco Unicorns finished on 148/7 in 20 overs.\n\nBrief Scores: San Francisco Unicorns 148/7 (Corey J Anderson 59, Hassan Khan 44, Noshtush Kenjige 2/13, Trent Boult 2/35) beat MI New York 145/7 (Dewald Brevis 56, Nicholas Pooran 26, Matthew Short 3/27, Brody Couch 2/27).",

A win will help us continue our unbeaten run this season along with guaranteeing a place in the top two of the standings.\n\nWe defeated MI New York by a mammoth 94 runs in our last game in Dallas on Tuesday, with Jasdeep Singh making a memorable debut for us in MLC with a three-wicket haul. Travis Head and Andries Gous also shone with half-centuries.\n\nThough Saurabh Netravalkar did not feature in our last match, he continues to be on top of the bowling charts for MLC 2024. The left-arm pacer has 12 wickets from four matches at an average of 9.16 and a strike rate of 7.66.

He was a tricky customer, surprising batters with his pace and bounce.\n\nJasdeep bowled 13 dot balls in his spell, piling pressure on the MINY middle order, who succumbed to the rising scoring rate. Ferguson also chipped in with two crucial wickets to skittle MINY.\n\nMeanwhile, Andries Gous scored his first fifty in MLC to anchor our batting and powered us to a dominant total of 182/5 batting first. Coming in to bat during the powerplay, Gous scored 59 off 48 balls before being dismissed on the last ball of the innings.\n\nThe fact that three of Gous’ four sixes came against leg spinner Rashid Khan speaks to his class and big-hitting ability. Travis Head displayed his attacking game yet again with a 33-ball 54 to give us a steady start and a solid foundation to go big in the death overs.\n\nThe Australian duo of Head and Smith were severe on the Texas Super Kings bowling attack chasing 204, in their last meeting on July 9.

    "date": "Tue Jul 16 11:21:40 2024",
    "body": "BY Kyle Marie McMahon\n\nCognizant Major League Cricket (MLC) opened its 2024 season in Morrisville on July 5. Despite the sweltering heat, the community packed Church Street Park (5800 Cricket Pitch Way) to watch MI New York defeat the Seattle Orcas by six wickets.\n\nThis is just the second season for MLC, which has six teams. MI New York won the inaugural title last year, and while the players hope for a repeat, Head Coach Robin Peterson says, “Last year is last year. Yes, it’s nice to come into a tournament as defending champions, but everybody starts on no points again. We’re very cognizant of the fact we’ve got to go and earn it again and play some good cricket if we’re going to be successful in this competition.”\n\nMLC is a Twenty20 league, which is a shortened format of cricket, designed to be played in a few hours rather than five days. If you are new to the sport, the rules may feel intimidating, but upon arrival, the league provides you with a handout to explain the scoring. For those familiar with baseball, it can be helpful to use it as a comparison for understanding the basics.\n\nAs in baseball, there is a fielding team and a batting team. Imagine the area from home plate to the pitcher’s mound. In cricket, this is called the pitch. There is still a pitcher (called a bowler) and a catcher (called a wicket-keeper), but instead of bases, cricket has “wickets,” which are three stumps with connecting sticks on top. The remainder of the fielding team is in the circular field that surrounds the pitch. The fielding team’s goal is to dismiss batters (get an out), which can be done by breaking the wickets or fielding the ball.\n\nThe batting team’s goal is to protect the wicket and hit the ball for runs. Two batters take the pitch at a time, standing at opposite wickets. Only one batter will hit the ball, but both will run, and each time they cross the pitch to the opposite wicket, a run is scored. As with all sports, there are special rules around batting, fielding and scoring, but you don’t need to know them all to start enjoying the game.\n\nAnd with continued investment in Church Street Park, you can expect interest in the sport to continue to grow. Harmeet Singh Baddhan, bowler for the Orcas, loves getting to play here. He says, “Every time we come here, it’s such good hospitality. People love cricket out here. It’s a smaller community, but there’s a lot of love for the game.”\n\nIt’s been an exciting and tight race this season, which was expanded to 21 matches, up from 15 last season. Washington Freedom is in first place with seven points, but there are still plenty of games to play. You can still catch the last game in North Carolina on July 17 at 3 p.m. before the season wraps in Grand Prairie, Texas. The round-robin playoffs will start July 24, with the championship game commencing on July 28 at Grand Prairie Stadium. Don’t stress if you weren’t able to make it to a game: the Minor League Cricket season, where you can watch our very own Morrisville Raptors play at Church Street Park, will start soon after.",

San Francisco Unicorns bowler le Roux was bowling his second over when Seattle Orcas batter Rickleton’s shot caught him by surprise and slammed onto his head. The nasty blow left le Roux’s face completely bloodied. Thankfully, le Roux was still in his senses despite the hit, and walked off without any help from his teammates.\n\nBowling the third over of the game, South African Le Roux was smashed on the head by a shot from compatriot Rickleton. Rickleton, a left-hander, had looked to hit it straight, but the shot ended up going straight at the bowler.\n\nWatch: Scary moment in MLC as Carmi le Roux gets hit on the head\n\nMedical staff were rushed on to the ground, but to everyone’s relief, le Roux was able to walk off on his own.\n\nSeattle Orcas at the bottom\n\nAfter le Roux was taken off, former New Zealand and current USA all-rounder Corey Anderson completed the over. Defending 165, the San Francisco Unicorns were able to restrict Seattle Orcas to just 142, despite missing le Roux.\n\nFormer England pacer Liam Plunkett, 39, was the pick of the bowlers, ending the game with figures of 3/26 in four overs.\n\nAfter that game, the Seattle Orcas suffered another defeat two days later, this time to the Los Angeles Knight Riders. This left the Orcas at the bottom of the Major League Cricket (MLC) season two table. Their fortunes this season are a stark contrast to the previous season, when they had topped the table.\n\nThe Orcas are currently on just one victory in five games. Defending champions MI New York are also in trouble, sitting fifth and outside the playoff spots.\n\nThe tournament started on July 5, 2024, and the final is set to be played on July 28.",

The win came with five balls remaining on Wednesday (July 17).\n\nDespite Ryan Rickelton's impressive 89 off 52 balls for the Seattle Orcas, his efforts were in vain. The Los Angeles Knight Riders secured their second win in six games, moving to fourth place on the points table. Washington Freedom has already qualified for the playoffs.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders chased a below-par score comfortably. Sunil Narine's lean run continued as Spencer Johnson dismissed him in the second over. However, Jason Roy (26) and Unmukt Chand (62) formed a vital partnership, taking the team to 47/1 by the end of the powerplay.\n\nThe partnership between Roy and Chand added 58 runs before Harmeet Singh broke it in the 10th over. Chand reached his half-century in 38 balls, hitting three sixes and three fours. Although he fell to Harmeet Singh in the 17th over, leaving LAKR at 120/5, they remained in control.\n\nEarlier, Seattle Orcas faced early setbacks when Corne Dry dismissed Shehan Jayasuriya (2), followed by Quinton de Kock's run-out without scoring. By the end of the powerplay, they were at 36/2, with Rickelton contributing 27 runs.\n\nRickelton accelerated in the ninth over, smashing Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a single over. He reached his half-century off just 28 balls with five sixes and four boundaries.\n\nLack of Support for Rickelton\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (23) provided some stability but was run out in the 12th over at 90/3. Despite Rickelton's continued aggression, hitting another six and four boundaries, other batsmen failed to support him adequately.\n\nAaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were bowled by Sunil Narine and Andre Russell respectively. Rickelton was eventually dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over, leaving Seattle Orcas at 142/6 after their allotted overs.\n\nFinal Push by LAKR\n\nNitish Kumar (12) and Saif Badar (18*) formed a brief partnership before Andre Russell contributed a quickfire 10 runs. This ensured that Los Angeles Knight Riders achieved their target with balls to spare. Harmeet Singh (2/27) and Cameron Gannon (2/35) were notable performers for Seattle Orcas.\n\nBrief Score:\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders:143/6(Unmukt Chand 62, Jason Roy 27; Harmeet Singh 2/27, Cameron Gannon 2/25)Seattle Orcas:142/6(Ryan Rickelton 82, Heinrich Klaasen 23; Corne Dry 1/8, Andre Russell 1/15)Result:Los Angeles Knight Riders won by four wickets\n\nStory first published: Thursday, July 18, 2024, 13:24 [GST]",

The Los Angeles Knight Riders, on the other hand, have majorly dipped since beginning their campaign with a victory.\n\nDATE & TIME: Sunday 14th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:30pm / USA PT – 12:30pm / West Indies – 2:30pm / UK – 8:30pm / South Africa – 9:30pm / Monday 15th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:30am / India – 1:00am / Bangladesh – 1:30am/ Australia – 5:30am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 35c or 95 F with clear, sunny skies\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM FORM: THE IMPRESSIVE WASHINGTON\n\nLed by Steve Smith, the Washington Freedom have a generally very impressive squad in this season’s Major League Cricket competition and that has reflected in the results with victories over last season’s finalists, MI New York and the Seattle Orcas. Even in their game that was eventually washed out, they were on 62-0 off just four overs in the hunt for 204 against the Texas Super Kings.\n\nLAST THREE: WAWLL\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: BACK TO BAD HABITS\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders finished rock-bottom in the Major League Cricket table last season but they managed to win their opening game against the aforementioned Texas Super Kings. Since then, though, they have been handily beaten by both the San Francisco Unicorns and Seattle Orcas so are under pressure as they head into this one at Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nLAST THREE: ALLWW\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nTravis Head has had an inconsistent opening set of matches and was dismissed for a two-ball duck in a low-scoring victory over the Orcas the other day. It is and will remain a rarity for the Australian to miss out too often, though, and against what is a fairly weak LAKR attack, backing Head to cash in as the Freedom’s top scorer would seem a reasonable shout.\n\nIt was an impressive display with the ball the other day in that win against Seattle as they bowled them out for just 124 in 19.4 overs. Lockie Ferguson had bowled really well until that point but failed to take wickets so the New Zealander picking up 4-26 will please him greatly. Ferguson continuing his good form with two or more wickets here seems likely.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nLAKR have really struggled to get off the mark with any sort of a flyer so far. Even their 12-run win over TSK was an unlikely defence of just 162. There is a lot of onus on David Miller to continue where he left off against Seattle Orcas whereby he scored 44 off just 22. Miller to be their top batter in the match seems the best bet for every LAKR match.\n\nBowling-wise, LAKR are fairly ineffective and lack any real thrust and incision, reliant on an ageing attack that includes the likes of Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan and Ali Khan. Their one dynamic weapon with the ball remains Spencer Johnson and he should pretty much always be backed to be their top bowler in a game.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS LOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThis one does actually appear to be a bit of a mismatch. Having a victory already in this tournament, which is better than they had at this stage of last season, is a small improvement and yet still flattering to what is an average LAKR side. This could end up being quite one sided on what should be a dry and difficult pitch but one that should suit the impressive Freedom top order. A comfortable Washington Freedom victory is to be expected.",
    "summary": "**Match Details:**\nThe Washington Freedom, led by Steve Smith, will face the Los Angeles Knight Riders in their fourth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket campaign on July 14, 2024, at Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States.\n\n**Recent Form:**\nThe Washington Freedom have won two matches so far, defeating MI New York and the Seattle Orcas, while one game against the Texas Super Kings was washed out due to weather. The Los Angeles Knight Riders, on the other hand, won their opening game but have since been defeated by the San Francisco Unicorns and Seattle Orcas.\n\n**Key Players:**\nFor Washington Freedom, Travis Head is expected to score well against the Los Angeles Knight Riders' weak attack, while Lockie Ferguson is likely to continue his good form with the ball. For Los Angeles Knight Riders, David Miller is expected to be their top batter, while Spencer Johnson is their top bowling prospect.\n\n**Prediction:**\nThe article predicts a comfortable Washington Freedom victory, citing the team's impressive squad and form, while the Los Angeles Knight Riders are expected to struggle due to their average performance so far in the tournament.",

For MI New York, Rashid Khan picked up 3 wickets for just 22 runs.\n\nDuring the chase, MI New York lost Ruben Clinton quite cheaply.

    "body": "Right then, that's it from this final group stage game, where the Texas Super Kings secured two more points and will head into the playoffs of this second season of Major League Cricket. The excitement continues with the first knockout game, the Eliminator, scheduled for Thursday, July 25th. In this high-stakes match, the Texas Super Kings will face off against MI New York for a coveted spot in the Qualifier. The first ball is set to be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT), but be sure to tune in earlier for all the pre-match buildup. Until then, cheers and goodbye!\n\nFaf du Plessis, the skipper of the Texas Super Kings says it was important for a few guys to get time in the middle and they decided to change the batting order a bit to make sure they head into the crucial stage with good momentum. Further adds that they focused on getting the small things right heading into the big Eliminator in a day's time.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, the skipper of Seattle Orcas says it has been a tough and difficult season for them. Adds that with a few guys being injured, it is quite difficult to find the concrete 11. Informs that the bowling group has been fantastic, but the batting group were the ones who could not make it count. Adds that it is very tough to find the rhythm of the game in just seven matches. States that they can make some investments in a couple of players. Concludes that it is not doom and gloom for the franchise and hopes to reset and re-focus for the next season.\n\nCalvin Savage is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his outstanding all-round performance. He says it was good fun after having put in so much hard work it felt very good. Adds that he tried to keep things simple in the middle and stay positive and it paid well for him with the bat. Further says he tries to vary the pace and keep it tight using long boundaries to his advantage. Concludes that he will try to keep things the same going ahead.\n\nEarlier in the game, Ayan Desai gave the Seattle Orcas a perfect start by dismissing Devon Conway on the very first ball of the innings. Cameron Gannon then joined the fray, taking another wicket in his first over. Despite these early setbacks, Faf du Plessis kept his intentions clear and continued to score from one end for TSK, but he lost his wicket just before the end of the powerplay. The Texas Super Kings kept losing wickets in the middle around Milind Kumar who looked steady in his outing but couldn't carry on after getting himself off to a good start. TSK however managed to get back on track in the final few overs, thanks to a blistering onslaught from Calvin Savage, who remained unbeaten with 45 off just 27 balls. He received valuable support from Cameron Stevenson, helping TSK reach a competitive total of 177 runs. For the Seattle Orcas, Keemo Paul and Ayan Desai had standout performances, each claiming two wickets.\n\nOttneil Baartman stood out with impressive figures of 3 for 20 for the Texas Super Kings. Alongside him, the other bowlers chipped in to ensure the job was done. Noor Ahmad was a mystery for the Orcas batters, ending with a couple of wickets, while Calvin Savage also claimed two wickets. Despite a few missed chances in the field, the Texas Super Kings will be mighty pleased with their efforts, particularly their comeback with the bat. They will now carry this momentum into the all-important eliminator.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, on whom the game was resting, once again failed to make his presence felt, extending his dry run with another low score and putting the Orcas in an even deeper hole. The Texas Super Kings' spinners compounded the Orcas' struggles, making run-scoring increasingly difficult. Shubham Ranjane and Keemo Paul fought back with a 39-run partnership, attempting to take on a few bowlers in the middle overs. However, with the asking rate soaring, it became an insurmountable task, resulting in another defeat for the Orcas. This marked their sixth loss in seven games, ending the tournament on a forgettable note.\n\nOttneil Baartman gave the Super Kings a perfect start by claiming the wicket of Ryan Rickelton on the very first ball of the innings. Despite a gritty partnership between Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya, the bowlers kept things tight, building pressure on the batters. This pressure led to the fall of a couple more wickets before the halfway mark, further complicating the chase for the Seattle Orcas.\n\nW\n\nOvers18.5\n\nScore132 - 9\n\nOttneil Baartman to Ali Sheikh, OUT! CAUGHT! Another one bites the dust. Ottneil Baartman entices the batter with the short one and he falls for it. Ali Sheikh swivels on his back foot and pulls it to deep square leg. The ball is hit flat and hard, but straight down the throat of Marcus Stoinis who makes no mistake this time either.\n\nW\n\nOvers18.3\n\nScore131 - 8\n\nOttneil Baartman to Cameron Gannon, OUT! CAUGHT! Marcus Stoinis takes a stunning catch near the ropes. It is too full, wide outside off. Cameron Gannon throws his blade at it and ends up slicing it to the left of deep backward point. Marcus Stoinis moves to his left and pouches it safely.\n\nW\n\nOvers16.4\n\nScore110 - 7\n\nOttneil Baartman to Shubham Ranjane, OUT! RUN OUT! A huge mix-up and Shubham Ranjane is a goner. It is a slower bumper, outside off. Shubham Ranjane miscues it towards mid on and ventures out looking for a single, but is caught in two minds here. Joshua Tromp charges in and throws it to the bowler, who gathers it and takes the bails off quickly at the non-striker's end.\n\nStrategic break! With 77 runs needed off the last 5 overs, the Seattle Orcas will need a few explosive overs right after this break to put pressure back on the opposition. These two batters have the capability to turn the game around but will need to focus on taking the game deep to maximize their chance. While for Texas Super Kings, a couple more wickets will probably put them closer to the winning line.",

    "body": "The Texas Super Kings: Led by Calvin Savage's all round performance, the Texas Super Kings handed the Seattle Orcas a comprehensive 37 run defeat in the final league match of the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nDespite Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya giving the Orcas a solid start in their run chase, the Texas Super Kings' bowlers, led by Ottneil Bartmann (3/20), Noor Ahmad (2/19) and Calvin Savage (2/23), dismantled the Seattle batting lineup.\n\nWith the match's conclusion, Seattle Orcas finished their campaign with six losses and a sole victory, whereas the Texas Super Kings who secured three wins and two losses (two no results) will play MI New York in the eliminator.\n\nTrending\n\nMirroring the first innings, the Seattle Orcas’ run chase lost Ryan Rickleton (0) off the first ball of the innings to Ottneil Bartman. Shehan Jayasuriya (24) joined Quinton de Kock (26), and the pair took control of the run chase. At the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 47/1.\n\nJayasuriya eventually fell to Savage in the seventh over after a 27-ball stint at the crease. Not long after, the dangerous Quinton de Kock was also dismissed, leaving the Orcas at 59/3 in the ninth over.\n\nFaced with a steep equation, the onus was on Heinrich Klaasen (4) and Matthew Bracewell (4) to steer the innings. However, both batters were outfoxed by spinners and dismissed for single digit. Mitchell Santner saw the back of Klaasen, while Bracewell was trapped lbw by Noor.\n\nComing together with the score at 67/5 in 10.4 overs, Shubham Ranjane (16) and Keemo Paul (25) labored to keep the Orcas in contention.\n\nHowever, Ranjane was run out and Keemo Paul was castled by Noor before the 17th over, comprehensively extinguishing the run chase. Ali Sheikh chipped in with a consolatory knock, but the Orcas fell well short, finishing at 140/9. Bartman took two wickets in the tail to finish with figures of 3/20.\n\nEarlier in the day. The Texas Super Kings lost opener Devon Conway (0) and Joshua Tromp (6) early in the innings, however Faf Du Plessis (37) was in fine form, smashing six boundaries and a six before he was scalped by Keemo Paul. At the end of the power play the Texas Super Kings were placed at 56/3.\n\nMilind Kumar (27) played a watchful knock, scoring nearly a run-a-ball before he became Paul’s second wicket of the day. The experienced all-rounders, Marcus Stoinis (11) and Mitchell Santner (15) both got starts, but failed to convert them into bigger scores, falling to Aryan Desai and Matthew Bracewell respectively.\n\nSavage (45*) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson, the pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings. Stevenson (17) struck a four and six to support Savage’s late innings fireworks, but was cleaned by Nandre Burger in the 18th.\n\nSavage hammered Bracewell for two consecutive maximums in the 16th over and went on to script a17 run over of Nande Burger’s 18th over to remain unbeaten and help the Texas Super Kings finish at 177/8.\n\nSavage (45*) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson, the pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings.

Opening batters Travis Head and skipper Steve Smith each scored 56 runs, forming a formidable 100-run opening stand.\n\nOn the bowling front, Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf struggled, conceding 20 runs in his two-over spell without taking a wicket.

As a result, USA have also qualified for the T20 World Cup 2026 to be played in India.\n\nMeanwhile, after giving us some enthralling cricket action, the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 season is nearing its climax, with the four teams advancing to the knockout stage already confirmed, even though one group-stage match remains as of writing this between the Texas Super Kings and Seattle Orcas. This upcoming match will not influence the standings or the knockout phase though.\n\nFind Best Betting Tips and Predictions for Major League Cricket 2024 Here\n\nThe teams advancing to the MLC 2024 knockouts are Washington Freedom (WSF), San Francisco Unicorns (SFU), Texas Super Kings (TSK), and MI New York (MINY), as all the teams finished in top four in the MLC 2024 points table. Now many might wonder how does the Major League Cricket (MLC) playoffs format works. In this article, we take a look at the MLC 2024 Playoffs format.\n\nThe Major League Cricket format is very much similar to that of the most successful T20 league in the world, the Indian Premier League (IPL). Just IPL, there is Eliminator, there is Qualifier 1, however, the Qualifier 2 is called the Challenger, we will get to know more about it.\n\nEliminator in MLC 2024\n\nNow in the IPL, the playoffs phase begins with the Qualifier 1 between the top 2 teams in the points table with the winner of the match directly going to the final. However, in this case, in the MLC, we will have the Eliminator first between the 3rd and 4th placed team. The winner of the match of will progress into the playoffs further while the loser is completely out of the competition, just like the Eliminator match in the IPL.\n\nQualifier in MLC 2024\n\nNow, Major League Cricket’s Qualifier is equivalent of the Indian Premier League (IPL)’s Qualifier 1. The top 2 teams at the end of the league phase in the MLC 2024 points table will play in this match. And just the like IPL, the winner of this match will directly progress into the MLC 2024 Final while the losing team will have another opportunity.\n\nChallenger in MLC 2024\n\nIn the Indian Premier League (IPL), in the Qualifier 2, the winner of the Eliminator and the loser of the Qualifier 1 plays. It is exactly the same format here as well where the Eliminator winning team will take on the losing team from the Qualifier match and in the end, the winning team will qualify for the Final against Qualifier winner. And rather than calling it qualifier, they call it Challenger as it identifies the challenger team for the Qualifier winner in the MLC 2024 Final.\n\nELIMINATOR: Texas Super Kings vs MI New York – 25th July, 6 A.M Indian Standard Time (IST), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium\n\nQUALIFIER: Washington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns – 26th July, 6 A.M Indian Standard Time (IST), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium\n\nCHALLENGER: Winner of Eliminator vs Loser of Qualifier – 27 July, 6 A.M Indian Standard Time (IST), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium",

Finn Allen and Matthew Short got San Francisco Unicorns off to a flying start. They smashed 34 and 56 runs respectively and got San Francisco Unicorns in a great position in the match.

Ryan Rickelton’s (89) breathtaking 52-ball knock for the Seattle Orcas was ultimately in vain.\n\nChasing a below-par score, the Los Angeles Knight Riders orchestrated a comfortable run chase. Sunil Narine’s (8) lean run continued when Spencer Johnson dismissed him in the second over, while Jason Roy (26) and Unmukt Chand (62) went on to build an important partnership. At the end of the powerplay, the Los Angeles Knight Riders were 47/1.\n\nThe 58-run alliance between Roy and Chand was derailed by Harmeet Singh in the 10th over. Unmukt Chand went on to bring up his half-century in 38 deliveries, comprising three sixes and three fours. In the 17th over, Chand fell to Harmeet Singh, but at 120/5, the Knight Riders were in a strong position.\n\nNitish Kumar (12) and Saif Badar (18*) came together for a brief partnership before Andre Russell (10) made a quick contribution to ensure the Los Angeles Knight Riders secured victory with balls to spare. Harmeet Singh (2/27) and Cameron Gannon (2/35) were the pick of the Orcas bowling efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Seattle Orcas suffered an early setback when Shehan Jayasuriya (2) was dismissed by Corne Dry. Soon after, Quinton de Kock (0) was run out without troubling the scorers. Opener Ryan Rickelton continued his fine form and quickly accumulated runs as he was joined by Heinrich Klaasen. By the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 36/2, with Rickelton having scored 27 of those runs.\n\nIn the ninth over, Rickelton shifted into another gear, hammering Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a 22-run over. Remarkably, no other batsman besides Rickelton had scored a boundary for the Orcas in the first 10 overs. Rickelton brought up his half-century in just 28 deliveries, featuring five maximums and four boundaries. Meanwhile, Klaasen (23) played a more guarded knock, providing stability at the other end until he was unfortunately run out in the 12th over at 90/3.\n\nWhile Rickelton continued to flourish, striking another six and four fours, the lack of support around him meant the Orcas failed to build any more concrete partnerships. Aaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were castled by the experienced Sunil Narine and Andre Russell before Rickelton would eventually perish just shy of a century, dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over. The Seattle Orcas finished on 142/6 in 20 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-24 (Shehan Jayasuriya - 3.2 ov), 2-26 (Quinton de Kock - 3.6 ov), 3-90 (Heinrich Klaasen - 11.6 ov), 4-113 (Aaron Jones - 15.4 ov), 5-121 (Michael Bracewell - 17.3 ov), 6-135 (Ryan Rickelton - 18.5 ov)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Fall of wickets: 1-13 (Sunil Narine - 2.2 ov), 2-71 (Jason Roy - 9.5 ov), 3-83 (David Miller - 11.1 ov), 4-105 (Nitish Kumar - 13.5 ov), 5-120 (Unmukt Chand - 16.4 ov), 6-140 (Andre Russell - 18.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XIs\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nRyan Rickelton\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nAaron Jones\n\nMichael Bracewell\n\nKeemo Paul\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nLungi Ngidi\n\nAli Sheikh\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nJason Roy\n\nSunil Narine(C)\n\nUnmukt Chand(WK)\n\nDavid Miller\n\nAndre Russell\n\nSaif Badar\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nCorne Dry\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nAli Khan\n\nWaqar Salamkheil\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Wednesday, July 17, 2024 20:00\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville\n\nToss: Seattle Orcas elected to bat",

By the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 36/2, with Rickelton having scored 27 of those runs.\n\nIn the ninth over, Rickelton shifted into another gear, hammering Waqar Salamkheil for two consecutive sixes and two fours in a 22-run over. Remarkably, no other batsman besides Rickelton had scored a boundary for the Orcas in the first 10 overs.\n\nRickelton brought up his half-century in just 28 deliveries, featuring five maximums and four boundaries. Meanwhile, Klaasen (23) played a more guarded knock, providing stability at the other end until he was unfortunately run out in the 12th over at 90/3.\n\nWhile Rickelton continued to flourish, striking another six and four fours, the lack of support around him meant the Orcas failed to build any more concrete partnerships. Aaron Jones (9) and Michael Bracewell (5) were castled by the experienced Sunil Narine and Andre Russell before Rickelton would eventually perish just shy of a century, dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the 19th over. The Seattle Orcas finished on 142/6 in 20 overs.\n\nBrief Scores: Los Angeles Knight Riders 143/6 (Unmukt Chand 62, Jason Roy 27, Harmeet Singh 2/27, Cameron Gannon 2/25) vs Seattle Orcas 142/6 (Ryan Rickelton 82, Heinrich Klaasen 23, Corne Dry 1/8, Andre Russell 1/15).",

However, Russell’s late heroics ultimately undone the Orcas’ efforts.\n\nLAKR solidifying their position in the top 4\n\nThis victory marked LAKR’s second win of the tournament and further solidified their position in the MLC 2024 points table.

Jayasuriya, having anticipated such a delivery, went for an unconventional stance. He executed a daring reverse scoop, timing it perfectly to send the ball effortlessly over the wicketkeeper's head for a boundary.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya's unbelievable reverse scoop stuns Haris Rauf\n\nThe Pakistan pacer, stunned by the audacity of the shot, glared at the Sri Lankan batter before turning back to his run-up.

Huge pluses for him today. It was a pretty big inning in the context of the game. 30 runs in a game like this is huge.”\n\nAnderson signed off by saying, “Pat Cummins is a world-class player; just having him in the group speaking cricket calms the group. Great for the balance of the team as well. We want to try and win every game; we go back to Dallas, and we want to reassess quickly, so hopefully we can get a bit of momentum out of this one.”",

He lauded young Krishnamurthi and Pat Cummins for their performances. Elaborating on the win after the game in the post-match presentation, he explained:\n\n\"Pretty good result.

    "date": "Wed Jul 17 14:33:23 2024",
    "body": "Cricket\n\n-OneArabia\n\nWashington Freedom secured a dominant 94-run victory over MI New York in their fifth match of Major League Cricket 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas. Travis Head and Andries Gous led the charge with impressive half-centuries, propelling Washington to a formidable total of 182/5 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, Washington's openers, Steve Smith and Travis Head, provided a steady start. However, Smith was dismissed by Rashid Khan in the fifth over after scoring 8 off 10 balls. Head then took control and formed a crucial partnership with Andries Gous. Their combined efforts helped Washington cross the 100-run mark by the 11th over.\n\nHead's aggressive innings of 54 off 33 balls included nine fours and two sixes before he was caught at long-on by Rashid Khan off Romario Shepherd’s bowling in the next over. Glen Maxwell followed soon after, despite being dropped earlier by Steven Taylor. Rashid Khan eventually dismissed Maxwell in the 16th over for 15 off 14 balls.\n\nIn the final overs, Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra accelerated the scoring rate. Gous reached his half-century in the 19th over, while Ravindra hammered two sixes and a four off Trent Boult in the same over, adding 23 runs. Ravindra was dismissed by Kieron Pollard for a quickfire 31 off 14 balls on the third ball of the final over. Gous ended his vital knock of 59 off 48 balls by getting caught on the last ball of the innings.\n\nWashington Freedom's bowlers then delivered an exceptional performance to dismantle MI New York for just 88 runs. The win ensured Washington Freedom became the first team to qualify for the Playoffs this season, solidifying their lead at the top of the points table with nine points from five matches.\n\nMI New York's Struggles\n\nMI New York had a disastrous start to their chase as they lost five wickets within the Powerplay, scoring only 25 runs. Steven Taylor (0 off 3), Monank Patel (4 off 6), Dewald Brevis (2 off 5), Shayan Jahangir (3 off 9), and Nicholas Pooran (4 off 6) were all dismissed cheaply by Washington’s bowlers.\n\nThe situation worsened as skipper Kieron Pollard (4 off 9) and Rashid Khan (7 off 6) were also sent back to the pavilion by the ninth over with MI New York struggling at 56/7. Romario Shepherd and Trent Boult showed some resistance by adding a quickfire partnership of 33 runs from just 16 balls.\n\nMaxwell Seals Victory\n\nShepherd’s valiant effort ended in the 11th over when he was dismissed for a brisk 25 off just 14 balls. Maxwell wrapped up proceedings for Washington Freedom by taking two wickets in the same over. He removed Boult (16 off 13) on his first delivery and Ehsan Adil (0 off 2) on his third ball, bowling out MI New York for just 88 runs.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Andries Gous:59 off48; Travis Head:54off33; Kieron Pollard:2/14in2overs) beat MI New York(Romario Shepherd:25off14; Trent Boult:16off13; Jasdeep Singh:3/14in3overs)by94runs.\n\nThis comprehensive win highlights Washington Freedom's strong form this season as they continue their quest for glory in Major League Cricket.\n\nStory first published: Wednesday, July 17, 2024, 14:33 [GST]",

    "body": "In a thrilling match of the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC), Washington Freedom secured their third consecutive victory by defeating Los Angeles Knight Riders by eight wickets on Sunday. Opting to bowl first, Washington’s bowlers dominated as they bundled out Los Angeles for 129 runs. Saurabh Netravalkar and Glenn Maxwell led the attack, with Netravalkar taking 4 wickets and Maxwell claiming 3.\n\nWashington’s chase was highlighted by a bizarre incident in the second over when Andre Russell’s fiery delivery broke Travis Head’s bat into two pieces, with the upper half flying towards mid-wicket. Despite this, Head and Steve Smith forged a brilliant opening partnership of 79 runs. Head smashed a quickfire 54, including six sixes, before being dismissed in the ninth over.\n\nSteve Smith anchored the innings with an unbeaten 42, guiding Washington to reach the target comfortably in just 16 overs. Rachin Ravindra and Andries Gous provided support as Washington Freedom finished at 130/2.\n\nLooking ahead, Washington Freedom will face MI New York in their next MLC encounter, while Los Angeles Knight Riders will take on Seattle Orcas in their upcoming match.

He has picked up 12 wickets for us so far this season at an astonishing average of 9.16 runs per wicket and a strike rate of 7.66.\n\nNetravalkar, who had a successful T20 World Cup 2024 campaign for the United States, has brought his rich vein of form into the MLC. The left-arm pacer was the USA’s top wicket-taker in the showpiece event with six wickets from six matches.\n\nNetravalkar averaged 20.83 and took a wicket every three overs he bowled (strike rate of 18.83) in the T20 World Cup. In a group where the USA were not even favorites to proceed to the Super 8, he, along with our wicketkeeper-batter Andries Gous, who finished as the USA’s top run-getter, took the team to the next round in a fairytale start to the country’s journey at ICC events.\n\nThe Mumbai-born Netravalkar earned accolades for his performance against Pakistan, where he bowled a high-pressure super over to win a thriller, and against India, getting the prized wickets of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.\n\nConsistent Performances\n\nNetravalkar had a tally of 10 wickets from six matches in MLC 2023, averaging 1.67 wickets per match. He picked up a wicket every 15.90 runs he conceded and for every 13.10 deliveries he bowled in the last edition.\n\nOur pacer finished as the joint fourth-highest wicket-taker overall in MLC 2023, with his 6/9 against the San Francisco Unicorns being the best figures recorded by any bowler in the MLC to date.\n\nComing into a new season, Netravalkar has become more lethal and consistent for us. His average wickets per match has moved up to three from 1.67 last year. The runs conceded per wicket has come down from 15.90 to 9.16 and balls per wicket has also reduced sharply from 13.10 to 7.66 compared to last year.\n\nNetravalkar’s economy has also marginally improved from 7.28 runs an over in 2023 to 7.17 currently. His clever variations and change of pace have made it difficult for batters to score against him with the dot-ball percentage going up from 42.75% last year to 52.17% this year.\n\nNetravalkar has had an excellent season so far in the MLC this year and his performance in the upcoming matches will be vital for us to go the distance.",

Netravalkar's form has carried over from his successful T20 World Cup 2024 campaign, where he was the top wicket-taker for the United States. Compared to last year's MLC season, Netravalkar's average wickets per match has increased from 1.67 to 3, and his economy has improved from 7.28 runs an over to 7.17.

Out of the four matches they have played, they have won only one. This puts them dead last in the points table with two points. On a two-match losing streak, this team needs to get a few positive results to turn around their season and they need to start winning some games now.\n\nAs for the LA Knight Riders, it could be argued that their season so far has been worse than that of the Orcas. Out of their five games so far, LA has won only one, lost three and one was washed out. They are only fourth on the table with three points because of their washed-out game against the San Francisco Unions. Out of the two reaming games, the Knight Riders have to win at least one for a place in the playoffs and a win here would give this side a solid boost.\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Match 1 MLC 2024: Match Details\n\nMatch: Seattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders, Major League Cricket match 14\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina\n\nDate & Time: Thursday, July 18, 12:30 AM (IST)/ July 17, 3:00 PM (local time)\n\nLive Broadcast and Streaming: Sony Sports Network, JioCinema App & Website\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Announced Squads\n\nSeattle Orcas Announced Squad\n\nWayne Parnell (C), Quinton de Kock (wk), Aaron Jones, Hammad Azam, Nauman Anwar, Heinrich Klaasen, Ryan Rickelton, Michael Bracewell, Shehan Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Waseem, Harmeet Singh, Nathan Ellis, Ali Sheikh, Obed McCoy, Nandre Burger, Lance Morris, Cameron Gannon, Ayan Desai, Zaman Khan\n\nLA Knight Riders Announced Squad\n\nSunil Narine (C), Jason Roy, Nitish Kumar, Unmukt Chand (wk), David Miller, Saif Badar, Alex Carey (wk), Adithya Ganesh (wk), Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Shadley van Chalkwyk, Corne Dry, Adam Zampa, Ali Khan, Josh Little, Spencer Johnson, Matthew Tromp, Derone Davis, Waqar Salamkheil\n\nCheck Out: Seattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Prediction MLC\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Pitch Report\n\nThis is one of the few pitches in modern T20 cricket (but maybe a typical pitch in the US) that is more bowling-friendly. This is a dry surface where the ball spins in the first innings. The pitch breaks down even more in the second, making it even more difficult to bat on.\n\nThe average score in the first inning here is somewhere around the 140-run mark, which falls drastically in the second inning, making batting first the common choice here after winning the toss.\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Weather Report\n\nThere is a heat advisory out in North Carolina, with the temperatures in the high 30s. The high humidity will make it feel like over 40 degrees Celcius.\n\nThe skies will be clear and cloudy periodically, with heavy thunderstorms and rains also expected. However, the match is not likely to be washed away. The winds will also be strong.\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Predicted Playing XI\n\nSeattle Orcas Predicted Playing XI\n\nRyan Rickelton, Shehan Jayasuriya, Quinton de Kock (wk), Heinrich Klaasen (C), Aaron Jones, Harmeet Singh, Hammad Azam, Cameron Gannon, Imad Wasim, Nandre Curger, Zaman Khan\n\nLA Knight Riders Predicted Playing XI\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine (C), Unmukt Chand, Shakib Al Hasan, Saif Badar, Nitish Kumar, David Miller, Andre Russell, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan\n\nSEO Vs LAKR Head To Head Record\n\nMatches Played: 02\n\nSeattle Orcas Won: 01\n\nLA Knight Riders Won: 01\n\nNo Result: 00\n\nFirst Played: July 23, 2023\n\nLast Played: July 10, 2024\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Prediction MLC\n\nWhile this match will be highly affected by the toss, we can not keep that in mind while making a prediction. So instead, we will look back at the recent record of these two teams, which has been fairly similar in this tournament. It is clear that both these sides do not compete with the better team this season, seeing how they have lost most of their matches by a big margin.\n\nIn their game earlier this season, the Seattle Orcas won their one and only match, this team also seems to have a better bowling attack as a whole. But, the Knight Riders have a better spin attack, giving them a distinct advantage on this dry track.\n\nThe LA Knight Riders also seem to have a better batting order, making them the favorites to win this one.\n\nSeattle Orcas Vs LA Knight Riders Prediction MLC: LA Knight Riders will defeat Seattle Orcas in the 1st Match of Major League Cricket 2024",

He is joined by wicketkeeper Devon Conway, Australian power-hitter Marcus Stoinis, fast-bowler Naveen Ul Haq and Team USA's Milind Kumar.\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) is the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States and began in 2023. Exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, MLC features superstars from around the world, bringing world-class T20 cricket to America.\n\nWith the 2024 season getting underway, here are some quick facts about MLC and what you can expect from T20 Cricket:\n\nWhere are the matches played?\n\nThe matches will take place at Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina. The full schedule and available tickets can be viewed here here.\n\nWho are the teams?\n\nThere are currently six teams in the MLC, representing different cities and regions in the United States: Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom.\n\nWho won last year?\n\nMI New York took victory in the inaugural MLC season of 2023 by defeating the Seattle Orcas.\n\nWhat is T20 Cricket?\n\nT20, or Twenty20, is a form of cricket.\n\nIt is a shortened format (approximately 3 hours) where each team has 20 overs (this comprises 120 balls) to score the most runs.\n\nIt is known for its explosive hitting, as the time constraints mean more motivation to hit big sixes and take risks. (Sixes are like home runs to all baseball fans).\n\nAn 'over' is the name given to six consecutive balls bowled by one 'bowler'. There are 20 of these overs in an 'inning'. There are two innings in a game.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nEach team consists of 11 batters who try to score more runs (points) than their opponent.\n\nThe fielding will attempt to retire all batters as quickly as possible to keep the run count low.\n\nA team earns one run when a batsman hits the ball and runs from one set of stumps to the other.\n\nTeams earn four runs for hitting the ball out of bounds and six runs for hitting the ball out of bounds without it touching the ground.\n\nThe bowler is the player who throws the ball at the stumps to knock off the bails. (The bowlers are the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball).\n\nWickets/stumps are the three vertical sticks with two smaller ones called bails that sit horizontally on top of them. The object is to knock the bails off.\n\nA player from the fielding team stands behind the stumps to catch the ball.\n\nThe white lines on the ground form the crease, this is where the wickets and the batsman should be positioned.\n\nWhat has MLC done for cricket in the US?\n\nMLC has revolutionized the cricket landscape in the US. Cognizant Major League Cricket recently achieved List-A status, recognized by the ICC as an official T20 league, making it America’s first domestic world-class tournament. The inaugural 2023 season was a huge success, with sold-out matches drawing millions of viewers worldwide. The recent T20 World Cup was played in the US and West Indies, and saw Team USA both co-host and participate in the tournament for the first time. Forty-seven of the players who played in the World Cup will remain in the US for MLC.\n\nMLC FAMILY DAY – SUNDAY SPECIAL\n\nMake your next family outing unforgettable.

The Challenger game will be played on the 27th of July 2024 at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT) where the Unicorns will face the Texas Super Kings. Our coverage will start an hour earlier so make sure to tune in for an exciting mactch. Until then, goodbye and cheers!\n\nSteven Smith, the captain of Washington Freedom says that captaincy has been fun and the team works as a unit. Says that it has been a good campaign and appreciates his team for playing well. Mentions that he wanted wickets with the new ball to make it easier towards the later stages. Credits Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell for playing well. Adds that Head is confident and tries to hit every ball and targets all the pockets of the ground which works for him.\n\nCorey Anderson, the captain of San Francisco Unicorns says that losing 4 wickets in the first innings was tough and that they were 20-30 runs short. Feels that they weren’t up to the mark throughout the game. Says that the batters need to take risks and they will bounce back stronger.\n\nTravis Head is the Player of the Match for his scintillating knock. He says that batting in the Powerplay is fun for him. Adds that he tries to get that fast start and that is his role in the team. Mentions that the wicket here is good and the swing on offer here allows him to play some good shots. Says that the team has full faith in him and has given him free air to do his thing.\n\nRachin Ravindra is up for a chat. He says that he is happy with his bowling and it was a good day for them. Mentions that it is all about execution and is happy to fulfill the role of the backup bowler. Adds that he aims to be a genuine all rounder and help the teams that he is a part of. Says that he tries to soak it as much as he can and learn from the senior players and coaches. Feels that he is adjusting to the role and learns from every experience.\n\nEarlier in the match, Washington Freedom won the toss and opted to have San Francisco bat first. The innings began with Marco Jansen claiming an early wicket, dismissing Finn Allen cheaply. Jake Fraser-McGurk followed suit, falling to Saurabh Netravalkar without scoring. Wickets kept on tumbling for them until Hassan Khan and Anderson joined hands. Hassan Khan played a commendable innings, scoring 57 runs, supported by Corey Anderson's 26 off 19, as they added 61 runs for the 6th wicket from just 35 balls. Once Anderson departed, the things kept falling apart for them. Rachin Ravindra was the standout bowler for the Washington Freedom with remarkable figures of 4 wickets for just 11 runs. Marco Jansen took three wickets but was expensive, while Saurabh Netravalkar ended up with 2 wickets in his kitty.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns would have wanted a few more runs on the board in the first innings but Pat Cummins gave them a great start with the wicket of Steven Smith. Hassan Khan then worked his spin magic and sent Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra back in consecutive overs. After that, the bowlers just gave away some loose deliveries and got themselves under pressure. The poor overs by Haris Rauf and Corey Anderson didn't help their cause and they failed to break the partnership. In the end, the total was a bit low to defend. However, they will still have one more chance in the Challenger to give themselves a ticket to the finals.\n\nWashington Freedom have beaten San Francisco Unicorns very confidently and established themselves in the finals directly! They had a shaky start with the early dismissal of Steven Smith and the initial struggle by Travis Head. However, Andries Gous came in to play a few shots while Travis Head too found his rhythm. His onslaught combined with Glenn Maxwell's power hitting gave the boost needed to this team. The positive intent got the opposition under pressure and sealed the game in their favor.\n\n6\n\nOvers14.4\n\nScore134 - 3\n\nHassan Khan to Glenn Maxwell, SIX! DISPATCHED! Too full and outside off.

    "body": "The stunning match of the American-based Major League Cricket (MLC) season was between the Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas. While there was not much at stake in terms of qualification to the playoffs until the last games, it was still important for the Super Kings to score a victory in the game. This was a major decision that saw the Seattle Orcas take the field before the Texas Super Kings, though this did not take long. The Super Kings faced a lot of trouble on the field, which resulted in the collapse of the team at one point, and by the end of the second over, they were down 12/2.\n\nWhile Faf du Plessis painstakingly tried to ensure a more sedate approach, wickets tumbled in a heap, and the Super Kings were in a state of disarray.\n\nMitchell Santner’s Heroic Moment For Texas Super Kings\n\nWhile the Texas Super Kings struggled against the rising pressure of Seattle Orca’s bowling attack, Kiwi all-rounder Mitchell Santner rose to the occasion. The fifth delivery of the 11th over saw Santner come up with a shot, which must have been a huge relief for his team, who seemed to be teetering at that stage. This particular shot reminded me a lot of one of the legends of the Super Kings, Suresh Raina.\n\nAli Sheikh, the Orcas’ spinner, bowled the ball up on off-stump, and there was no nonsense about Santner, who started showing immense composure and accuracy and played a wonderful inside-out against the spinner over long-off for a giant six. It could also be seen as a soft skill for the analysis, and the timing for this shot was reminiscent of Raina’s famous move. Raina was famous for playing spinner, and this shot was famous with him when he played for Super Kings, while Santner did this well as a mimic to Raina.\n\nA Tribute to Suresh Raina\n\nIt was not just a show of force, but it was all about Suresh Raina and his great contribution to the Indian cricket team. Raina, one of the superior strapping batsmen loved for his originality and hostility against spinners, was a part of the Super Kings’ legacy. Santner, in particular, mimicked Raina’s shot in the context of the match’s execution, where he went inside out to a spinner, thus giving the fans a memory to denote.\n\nOver the courtesy of some fine fast bowling from the Orcas, Santner’s knock was the only bright spark for the Super Kings as the match went on. His capacity to embody the spirit of one of the squad greats established his worth within the lineup, becoming a symbol of strength at the touchdown poker site amid the team’s misfortunes.\n\nWhile the result of the match was not decisive and seemingly did not change the position of the teams significantly, the moment when Mitchell Santner set for the ball and scored a long shot supported by Ali Sheikh was the moment that made cricket exciting and presented the essence of the Texas Super Kings. In such a lighter vein, as the Super Kings will turn their attention to the playoffs, Santner’s innings underlined the best virtues of this team.",

Corey Anderson took a sensational catch to get rid of Faf du Plessis in the Challenger match of the ongoing T20 tournament.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns posted a formidable 200/6 in 20 overs against the Texas Super Kings. The knockout match took place at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Saturday, July 27 (IST). Opener Finn Allen scored an impressive century of 101 runs off 53 balls with the help of nine boundaries and five maximums.\n\nJosh Inglis scored 37 runs from 25 balls, and Hassan Khan added 27 off 15 balls. Left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad was the standout bowler for the Super Kings, claiming three wickets for 27 runs. The Faf du Plessis-led team needed to chase down the target to reach the final match of the Major League Cricket.\n\nWatch: Corey Anderson Takes Sensational Catch To Dismiss Faf du Plessis\n\nFaf du Plessis and Devon Conway provided a flying start for the team as they added 50 runs in just 4 overs. Du Plessis scored 45 runs off 22 deliveries, including seven boundaries and one six. However, the TSK skipper's innings ended with a spectacular one-handed catch by Corey Anderson during the fifth over.\n\nThe right-handed batter mistimed a shot off pacer Carmi le Roux. The former New Zealand all-rounder, who was positioned at mid-off, timed his jump perfectly to make a stunning catch with his left hand. The Super Kings lost their first wicket with 55 runs on the board in 4.2 overs during the recent MLC match.\n\nDevd Conway (62 off 38 balls) and Joshua Trump (56 off 36 balls) scored unbeaten half-centuries during the run chase.

Juanoy Drysdale picked up two wickets for 33 runs in his four overs, while Hassan Khan and Carmi le Roux each took one wicket.\n\nThat Catch Helped Us - Corey Anderson\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns skipper Corey Anderson stated that they managed to secure victory due to crucial moments, including Juanoy Drysdale’s performance and his spectacular catch. Anderson said that his catch of Faf du Plessis was pivotal in disrupting the Super Kings' momentum.\n\n\"I thought they kept going (TSK batters), but we kept hanging in and we had runs on the board. He was incredible tonight, won us the moments in the middle (on Drysdale), was a bit underdone coming into the tournament, but has got better with games. It was moments like that which will help us going further (on his one-handed catch), Faf has been playing well right through the tournament, so that catch helped us to stall some of the momentum away from them,\" Anderson said.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns will face the Washington Freedom in the final game at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday, July 29 (IST).",

    "body": "In a match that will be etched into Major League Cricket (MLC) folklore, Glenn Maxwell‘s colossal six propelled the Washington Freedom to a thrilling seven-wicket victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in Qualifier of the MLC 2024. Chasing a modest 146, Freedom were in trouble at 64/3 before Maxwell unleashed his power-hitting prowess to turn the game on its head.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have a stick\n\nBatting first, the San Francisco Unicorns posted a competitive total of 145 runs in their allotted 19 overs. Hassan Khan, the tournament’s standout bowler, once again showcased his talent with a quickfire 57. However, the Unicorns’ innings was derailed by a brilliant spell from Rachin Ravindra, who claimed four wickets for just 11 runs to stifle the Unicorns’ momentum. Marco Jansen also chipped in with three wickets as the Freedom bowlers kept a tight leash on the Unicorns’ batting.\n\nGlenn Maxwell’s masterclass\n\nWith the bat, Washington Freedom were off to a shaky start, losing their top three batters cheaply. The pressure was mounting on the Freedom, but then, Maxwell arrived at the crease. The Australian maverick wasted no time in asserting his dominance, launching into the Unicorns’ bowlers with reckless abandon.\n\nThe highlight of the innings, and perhaps the entire tournament so far, came when Maxwell deposited a Hassan delivery into orbit during the 15th over. The ball cleared the boundary with disdain, going a staggering 103 meters away. The crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium was left in awe as they witnessed a shot that will be replayed for years to come.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nMaxwell’s brutal hitting took the game away from the Unicorns. He raced to a fifty, providing the much-needed impetus to the Freedom chase. With Travis Head providing steady support, the duo ensured that Washington Freedom crossed the line with seven wickets in hand and three balls to spare.\n\nAlso WATCH: Pat Cummins dismisses Steve Smith on the very first ball of his spell in MLC 2024\n\nWashington Freedom advance to the Final\n\nThe victory propels Washington Freedom into the final of the MLC 2024. They will be brimming with confidence after Maxwell’s match-winning heroics. On the other hand, the San Francisco Unicorns will be disappointed to miss out on the final, but they can take solace from their impressive performance throughout the tournament.\n\nHassan, despite conceding the longest six of the tournament, has been a revelation and will undoubtedly be a key player for the Unicorns in the future. The final promises to be a blockbuster clash and cricket fans around the world will be eagerly anticipating the showdown between the two best teams in the tournament.",
    "summary": "**Match Result:** Washington Freedom won by 7 wickets against San Francisco Unicorns in the Qualifier of MLC 2024.\n\n**Score:** San Francisco Unicorns scored 145 runs in 19 overs, while Washington Freedom chased it down with 7 wickets in hand and 3 balls to spare.\n\n**Key Performances:**\n\n* Glenn Maxwell delivered a match-winning performance, scoring a fifty and hitting a 103-meter six, the longest of the tournament, to turn the game in favor of Washington Freedom.\n* Rachin Ravindra took 4 wickets for 11 runs to restrict San Francisco Unicorns' innings.\n* Hassan Khan scored 57 runs for San Francisco Unicorns, but conceded the longest six of the tournament to Maxwell.\n\n**Tournament Implications:** Washington Freedom advances to the final of MLC 2024, while San Francisco Unicorns are eliminated from the tournament.",

    "date": "Sat Jul 27 06:20:51 2024",
    "body": "Despite being 40, Faf du Plessis is the best batter in the Major League Cricket 2024. He was also brilliant in IPL 2024. There is no reason why he cannot play a few more years in the IPL. However, Royal Challengers Bengaluru may not retain him. He may not be worth the retention amount, especially because of his game. That said, a few other teams will target to sign him. On that note, here, we take a look at the list of two franchises which might target Faf du Plessis for IPL 2025 if he is released by RCB.\n\n1) Chennai Super Kings\n\nIt is for the Texas Super Kings that Faf du Plessis played so well in MLC 2024. He was decent for the Joburg Super Kings in SA20 2024. Considering his past success at CSK, it is not a surprise if CSK goes back for him again in the IPL 2025 Mega Auctions.\n\nAt the moment, CSK needs an opener who can make the best use of the powerplay. Both Faf and Devon Conway combined well for TSK in MLC 2024. CSK will look to have both of them back again in the side. Faf is a CSK legend and it is best that he gets his farewell at this franchise as per the fans of CSK. It needs to be seen if this could happen, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Punjab Kings\n\nPunjab Kings is one of the franchises which might target Faf du Plessis for IPL 2025 if he is released by RCB. It needs to be noted that Faf du Plessis is the skipper of St Lucia Kings in the CPL, a franchise which is also owned by the owners of Punjab Kings.\n\nPlus, Faf is in great form and would provide a captaincy choice straightaway. The home venue for PBKS might also suit Faf’s style although it might not be perfect for him. Under him, the franchise can adopt a better structure and streamline their progress.",
    "summary": "* Faf du Plessis, 40, is currently the best batter in the MLC 2024.\n* He played well for the Texas Super Kings in MLC 2024 and was decent for the Joburg Super Kings in SA20 2024.\n* Du Plessis' success in MLC 2024 could lead to interest from other franchises, including Chennai Super Kings and Punjab Kings, if he is released by Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\n* Chennai Super Kings might be interested in re-signing du Plessis due to his past success with the franchise and his ability to pair well with Devon Conway, his opening partner for the Texas Super Kings.\n* Punjab Kings might also target du Plessis due to his captaincy experience with St Lucia Kings in the CPL, which shares the same owners as Punjab Kings.",

Lahiru Milantha (33* off 30) and Obus Pineaar (31* off 30) then made a crucial partnership of 63 runs to guide Washington Freedom across their 125 run target with 10 balls to spare.\n\nWith this victory, Washington Freedom moved to the top of the table with 5 points from three matches, standing as the only unbeaten team in the tournament thus far.\n\nSeattle Orcas came out blazing to defend a low total of 125 runs. Imad Wasim dismissed Travis Head for a duck on the second ball of the innings, ending his over with a wicket and a maiden. Steve Smith and Rachin Ravindra then tried to rebuild the score with a counter attack, and they scored as many as 18 runs in the 3rd over. Ravindra was looking dangerous with his bat, but Nandre Burger dismissed him in the fifth over for 26 off 16 balls. Smith followed him back to pavilion in the over that followed with 12 off 13, leaving the Orcas at 47/3 after 6 overs.\n\nBoth Mukhtar Ahmed and Glenn Maxwell were given lifelines as both of their catches were dropped once, but they couldn’t make use of their second chances. Ahmed(8 off 8) was dismissed by Burger in 8th over, and Maxwell(10 off 11) fell to Harmeet, leaving their team struggling at 68/5 after 10 overs.\n\nDespite the situation, Washington Freedom batters showed their agility as they carefully approached their target.\n\nEarlier in the contest, Seattle Orcas had a slow start to their innings. The Seattle batters struggled to accelerate on the slow batting track, only getting 35 runs in the powerplay.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen and Shubham Ranjane carefully made a crucial partnership that somewhat steadied Seattle’s innings. They crossed 100-run mark in the 15th over.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington bowlers didn’t allow the batters to score big. Ferguson took 2 wickets in the 27th over, finishing his spell with 4 wickets, leaving Seattle struggling at 112/8 after 18 overs.\n\nSeattle managed to get 9 runs in penultimate over. Cameron Gannon struck a six, but was dismissed on his second attempt as Ferguson caught him out. Netravakar then removed Nandre Burger, thus bowling out Orcas at 124 in 19.4 overs.",

    "body": "LAS vs SF, MLC 2024: Dream11 Predictions for Match 10 [X]\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAS) will be playing against the San Francisco Unicorns (SF) in the 10th match of the Major League Cricket (MLC 2024). This match will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, United States, on July 14th at 12:30 AM IST.\n\nAhead of the game, here is a look at the Dream11 predictions, the pitch report, fantasy tips, the top player picks and the best-predicted XIs for the fantasy contests of the match.\n\nLAS vs SF Head-to-Head Stats\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders and the San Francisco Unicorns have played two matches against each other so far. Both the games have been won by the Unicorns.\n\nLAS vs SF Pitch Report\n\nThe wicket at Chruch Street Park has looked good for batting. The batters have enjoyed the surface and have got full value for their shots. As for the bowlers, the pacers have had to rely on their cutters and variations in pace to be effective on this track. The spinners have also got some help from this wicket.\n\nHowever, with the incessant rain that has been happening here for the past 24 hours or so, there might be a might of moisture on the wicket and in the air, helping the new ball bowlers at the start of the innings.\n\nChurch Street Park Ground Stats (MLC 2024)\n\nMatches: 5\n\nMatches won batting first: 0\n\nMatches won batting second: 3\n\nNo Result or Abandoned: 2\n\nFantasy value from the pitch report\n\nThe pitch has been the best for batting in the first few overs when the ball is hard and coming on nicely to the bat. So, the top-order batters from both teams will be good picks for the game. Notably, the wicket has been easier to bat on in the second innings. So, keeping more batters from the team that is chasing could be a beneficial choice.\n\nThe spinners will be the best pick for this match. However, you can also back the faster bowlers who try to bowl into the wicket and mainly rely on the change of pace to deceive the batters.\n\nLAS vs SF Fantasy Cricket Tips\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nJason Roy, Unmukt Chand, and David Miller have been the inform batters for the Knight Riders. You can keep all three or at least two of these batters in your team if you are backing Los Angeles to win this game.\n\nSpencer Johnson has been in a great rhythm with the ball in this tournament so far. He is currently the wicket-taker for his team and will be a must-pick for the game. Andre Russell and Sunil Narine have not yet proved themselves with the ball in this tournament. However, the wicket at Church Streek Park might suit them, and the West Indian duo can give you high points.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Heavy Fantasy XI\n\nMatthew Short has been the man in for with the bat for the Unicorns. He has looked in supreme touch and will be one of the safest picks for the game. Finn Allen has also been in decent form and played a brilliant knock in the first game. Allen could also be a highly rewarding choice for the game.\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk has not yet found his rhythm with the bat in this tournament. However, the potential of this young Aussie batter is known to all, and he could be a decisive choice in the fantasy contests.\n\nBrody Couch has looked good with the ball and will be one of the safer picks from the Unicorns' bowling. You can also keep Haris Rauf in your team, as his ability to hit the deck could prove to be beneficial on this track. However, the game changer in this game could be the young Paksitanin spinner, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nLAS vs SF Winner Prediction\n\nThe wicket will favour the batters, and we can expect to see a match where both the teams will go past the 160 mark. In the games that have already taken place here in this edition of the MLC, we have seen that batting has got relatively easier in the second innings, and hence, the team chasing the target will have the advantage in the game.\n\nLAS vs SF Top Player Picks\n\nUnmukt Chand (LAS)\n\nThe Indian-origin US batter has looked in a decent touch with the bat. Although Unmukt Chand has not fired after the first game of the tournament, the form that he seems to be in makes him one of the safer choices from the Los Angeles batting line-up.\n\nSpencer Johnson has been the best bowler for the Los Angeles in MLC 2024 [X]\n\nSpencer Johnson (LAS)\n\nThe young Aussie speedster from this team looked the most impressive with the ball. Spencer Johnson has the most number of wickets in the tournament for his team and will be one of the better picks for the fantasy contests.\n\nMatt Short (SF)\n\nThe Australian top order batter has been in prime touch and has looked ominous in both the games. Matt Short has the form and rhythm with him and will be looking to build on that on a track that will encourage his audacious stroke play.\n\nAbrar Ahmed (SF)\n\nThough this Pakistan leggie has not picked up wicket, he has looked impressive with the areas the he has bowled. On a pitch, that might provide a bit of assistance to the spinners, Abrar Ahmed could be a good choice for the game.\n\nLAS vs SF Differential Picks\n\nAndre Russell (LAS)\n\nThis Jamaican all-rounder has not yet been at his best in the tournament. But there is no questioning the match-winning abilities of Andre Russell with both the bat and the ball. If he gets a bit of rhythm going for himselft, Russell could prove to be a game-changing pick for the match.\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk has not yet fired in MLC 2024 [X]\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk (SF)\n\nThis young Aussie batter is known for his explosive batting style. Though Jake Fraser-McGurk has not found form in this edition of the MLC so far, he could be a decisive choice for the fantasy contests if he starts finding the middle of the bat.\n\nLAS vs SF Fantasy Expert Advice\n\nWait for the toss and keep more top-order batters from the team that bats second. A 2-2-4-3 or a 1-2-3-5 combination could work well for the game.\n\nLAS vs SF Fantasy Team for Head-to-Head/Small Leagues\n\nWicketkeepers: Unmukt Chand, Josh Inglis\n\nBatters: Jason Roy, Finn Allen\n\nAll-rounders: Shakib Al Hasan, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Matthew Short\n\nBowlers: Abrar Ahmed, Spencer Johnson, Brody Couch\n\nCaptain: Sunil Narine\n\nVice-captain: Andre Russsell\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: 6 Players; San Francisco Unicorns: 5 Players\n\nLAS vs SF Fantasy Team for Winner Takes All/ Grand Leagues\n\nWicketkeeper: Josh Inglis\n\nBatters: David Miller, Jake Fraser-McGurk\n\nAll-rounders: Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell, Matthew Short\n\nBowlers: Ali Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Spencer Johnson, Hairs Rauf, Brody Couch\n\nCaptain: Jake Fraser-McGurk\n\nVice-captain: Abrar Ahmed",

    "body": "MI New York: In a rain-marred third match of the ongoing Major League Cricket 2024 at the Church Street Park in Morrisville, Washington Freedom prevailed over MI New York by four runs via the DLS Method.\n\nThe match was a tightly contested one. In the second innings, Washington Freedom faced an early setback with the dismissal of Travis Head (1). Steve Smith initially took a couple of overs to settle in, but once he found his rhythm and struck his first boundary on his seventh ball, the New York bowlers struggled to contain him. The Australian star batter smashed four fours and three sixes, racing to an impressive 46* off 28 balls.\n\nWith 7.4 overs of the Washington Freedom innings done, the match took a turn for the worse as rain and lighting brought on the covers. However, Smith’s power-hitting in the final over of the powerplay took them ahead on DLS with a score of 55/1. In the end, that proved enough to seal the match as rain played spoilsport.",

Gannon’s delivery, clocking in at 135 kmph, landed on a perfect length angled towards the off-stump. Smith, known for his aggressive stroke play, charged down the pitch aiming to drive through the off-side.\n\nHowever, Gannon’s deceptive movement caught Smith off-guard.

The match held at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas saw Washington Freedom successfully chase down Seattle Orcas’s target of 125 runs in the first inning.\n\nRachin Ravindra’s spectacular onslaught against Imad Wasim\n\nSeattle Orcas, batting first, scored 124 runs before being bowled out. This set Washington Freedom’s target of 125 runs to achieve victory. Chasing the set total, the Washington side faced an early setback as Travis Head was dismissed in the very first over, leaving them at 6/1.\n\nHowever, Ravindra’s entry into the game proved to be a turning point. Coming in to bat, Ravindra faced Wasim in the third over of the 2nd innings.\n\nRavindra hammered 17 runs off Wasim in a single over, comprising two sixes and a four. This onslaught boosted Washington Freedom’s run rate and rattled the opposition. Wasim, who had earlier taken the wicket of Head in his first spell, struggled against Ravindra’s aggressive batting. Despite finishing his 4-over spell with a total of 31 runs, Wasim’s over to Ravindra stood out for its impact on the match.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Cameron Gannon cleans up Steve Smith during SO vs WF game in MLC 2024\n\nRachin Ravindra’s dominance secures Washington Freedom’s convincing victory\n\nRavindra’s innings was pivotal as he went on to score 26 runs off just 16 balls at a striking rate of 162.50, including three fours and two sixes.

    "body": "After many U.S. sports fans got their first taste of elite cricket during this summer’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup hosted partially in Florida, New York, and Texas, the country’s burgeoning professional competition is making noticeable strides in its second season.\n\nMajor League Cricket will finish its 21-match schedule this week before a four-team playoff crowns a new champion. While the league has six teams from coast to coast, all matches have been played at two cricket-specific venues in Texas and North Carolina. Still, attendance is tracking to potentially surpass the 70,000 fans who showed up for the inaugural season in 2023.\n\nMLC’s media rights are held by a niche cricket-focused channel called Willow by Cricbuzz. But the broadcaster struck deals with mainstream regional sports networks in each team’s market in an effort to attract more fans.\n\nDallas: Bally Sports Southwest\n\nLos Angeles: Bally Sports SoCal\n\nWashington, D.C.: Monumental Sports Network\n\nSan Francisco: NBC Sports Bay Area\n\nSeattle: Root Sports\n\nNew York: YES Network\n\nWillow took a similar approach during the T20 World Cup to get more exposure.\n\nMoney Game\n\nTeams in MLC operate under a $1.15 million salary cap. While that’s well under the roughly $12 million that franchises can spend annually in the world’s richest cricket competition, the Indian Premier League, it’s not far off from other global leagues like Cricket Australia ($2 million) and The Hundred ($1.3 million) in the U.K.\n\n“The money is good. But also the product’s good,” says Liam Plunkett (above, far right), a bowler for the San Francisco Unicorns who was a member of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup. “I think if the product wasn’t rolled out and the standard wasn’t good, people wouldn’t be that interested in coming across.”\n\nPlunkett has remained impressed with the quality of play two seasons in. “I think there were a lot of teething problems leading up to it, but when the competition started, it felt like you could be playing anywhere in the world,” he says.\n\nBig Ambitions\n\nBefore this season, San Francisco made a splash when it signed Australia national team captain Pat Cummins to a four-year contract. Have those moves been difficult to make? “Surprisingly not,” Anand Rajaraman, a co-owner of the Unicorns, tells Front Office Sports. “I think everybody in the cricket world is excited about the possibility of the U.S. market.”\n\nPlunkett echoes that sentiment. “There’s definitely opportunities,” he says of being in the U.S. “Are you looking to play some good cricket? But also, are you looking to do some business deals and build yourself even further as a brand?”",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani, and other deep-pocketed investors worth a collective $126 billion own franchises in Major League Cricket. But launching a new major sports league in the United States has long been a sticky wicket.\n\nBy Sofia Chierchio, Contributor\n\nInside a crowded cricket stadium in Bangalore, India, as the Indian Premier League prepared to begin its inaugural match in April 2008, Anurag Jain gazed at the owner’s balcony as a familiar Hindi song pumped up the many fans in attendance. “Someday, I want to play that song and stand on the balcony like that guy,” he recalls saying. “It wasn’t about vanity; it was about bringing this sport that my family and friends enjoyed together to [America]—my home.”\n\nIn India, cricket is widely considered the most popular sport in the country, both by participation and viewership. Yet as successful as it may be in the UK and other former British colonies, the sport has hardly gained a foothold in the United States. But the 62-year-old Jain—chairman of Access Healthcare, a Dallas-based healthcare company—and a group of deep-pocketed investors—including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan and Jain’s co-owner, Texas real estate developer Ross Perot Jr.—are betting they can finally change that.\n\nIn 2019, American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the San Francisco-based parent company of Major League Cricket (MLC), pledged $1 billion to develop the sport in the U.S. Three years later, MLC secured $120 million in funding. With just six teams—New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Washington, DC—the inaugural 2023 season attracted some 70,000 fans across its games, generating an exceedingly modest $8 million in revenue. With its sophomore season, which began on July 5, underway, MLC is looking to capitalize on surging global interest in the sport, which was bolstered by Team USA’s upset of Pakistan in the Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup in June.\n\n“We're very serious as a collective,” says former Microsoft executive Sanjay Parthasarathy, who co-owns the Seattle Orcas with Nadella. “We're seasoned businesspeople. So, we have a discipline, a business discipline. We're running this like a startup. We're pinching pennies. We've got to invest in the right places so we're not throwing money around for sure.”\n\nMLC’s backers, many of whom are of Indian descent, don’t have to look too far to find a model for success. Established in 2008, the Indian Premier League (IPL) revolutionized cricket by adopting the T20 format, a shorter, more dynamic version of the game. Traditional cricket matches can last for days, but T20 cricket condensed the action into three and a half hours of energetic play, making it more appealing to a wider audience. And the value of IPL clubs has skyrocketed in recent years, with the average value of the league’s 10 teams crossing $1 billion in 2022, according to Forbes’ most recent valuations.\n\nAnd much as Major League Soccer had to overcome the fact that American soccer fans can already watch the world’s best leagues in the United States, the MLC has to contend with an fanbase that is already tuning in to IPL matches on Willow TV, the main broadcaster of cricket in the US.\n\n“The Commonwealth Diaspora has always looked at sports differently than the core American audience,” Parthasarathy says of the TV challenges. “There is an intersection between the diaspora and the hardcore American sports, so there’s a lot of opportunity to be tapped into. That’s the core; it doesn’t mean that’s where we end.”\n\nFor now, according to some owners, the goal for this season is simply to build on the product that debuted last year. The league also has a five-year broadcast partnership with Willow, its most substantial source of revenue. MLC also generates income from ticket sales and sponsorships, taking a page out of the Formula 1 playbook. “One of the biggest sources of income are the logos plastered on our jerseys,” Jain says. “In fact, I think we are the first team to get all of our logo spots sold this year, which I think is an amazing achievement.”\n\nBut if cricket is going to be successful in America, a massive investment in infrastructure is needed. Veteran Silicon Valley venture capitalist Anand Rajaraman, co-owner of the San Francisco Unicorns, estimates that a single purpose-built stadium in the Bay Area would cost at least $30 million.\n\n“You’ve got to have world-class places where people can train and play,” Parthasarathy emphasizes. “You can’t play on a baseball diamond because one of the big aspects of cricket is the pitch. It’s got to be well done and done the right way. Those facilities are really important, and I see that happening over the next 10 years.”\n\nIn addition to infrastructure for stadiums, many MLC owners believe that attracting a broader cricket audience goes hand-in-padded-glove with cultivating domestic talent. According to MLC rules, of the 11 cricketers on the pitch, at least five must be American players. Sanjay Govil, founder of the Maryland-based Infinite Computer Solutions and owner of the Washington Freedom, believes this strategy allows homegrown talent to learn from some of the best international coaches and players.\n\nCricket is expected to get another major boost when it makes its Olympic return in 2028 after a 128-year hiatus. Taking place in Los Angeles, the increased attention could be monumental in growing the new league.\n\n“I think it's extremely important that the world sees cricket at that stage,” Jain claims. “You’ll see how cricket grows because of the Olympics, but most important to us, it's coming here, it's coming to our country.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesIPL Cricket Team Values Would Soar With A $30 Billion Saudi InvestmentForbesThe World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams 2024",

It underlines further the importance of their victory last time out over Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: WLA\n\nMI NEW YORK FORM: A REVERSAL OF FORTUNES ESSENTIAL TO SAVE THEIR SEASON.\n\nLosing three games on the spin heading into this final group game has left MI New York on the outside looking in and even beating the Knight Riders here may not be enough for them to break into the top four. A significant net-run-rate swing is also required for them to overhaul Los Angeles.\n\nLAST THREE: LLL\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nExperience is key for Los Angeles Knight Riders in a contest of such magnitude, which could see bettors turn to all-rounder Andre Russell when it comes to investing in their players here. Russell offers value in multiple markets but with MINY forced to play aggressively with the bat in a bid to pile up quick runs, this may play to the strengths of the West Indian. His variations make backing him to accumulate 2+ wickets a shrewd play.\n\nJason Roy is a player that can so often get whatever team he plays for off to a good start and LAKR will hope for the same on this occasion. Roy struck 27 in a win over rock-bottom Seattle Orcas and even if he wasn’t to gain a really big score, even a cameo could be crucial. Therefore, consider backing Roy to put up over 23.5 match runs.\n\nMI NEW YORK BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWe’ve highlighted the big-hitting abilities of Dewald Brevis previously and the young South African didn’t let bettors down against San Francisco Unicorns last time out, striking 56 from 36 balls. Brevis cleared the boundary rope three times and stakes on him to not only score 20+ runs here, but also to hit over 0.5 match sixes has to be favoured in a must-win game.\n\nTrent Boult’s potency with the ball will be crucial both in the powerplay and the death. Early wickets especially has to be seen as essential for MI New York as they look to overhaul their net-run-rate deficit and the left-arm point of difference that Boult provides is ideal on this front. Back the New Zealander to take over 1.5 match wickets here as he did in his last appearance.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS MI NEW YORK EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nMI New York has no choice but to play fearlessly and aggressively, knowing that they not only need to win here, but win well to overturn the net-run-rate deficit between them and Los Angeles Knight Riders. This could go one of two ways, with either a fired-up and focused MINY blowing away their opponents, or reckless cricket ultimately costing them due to their hand being essentially forced.\n\nBut it’s important to note that LAKR don’t have prior success in this tournament and a bad start here could see doubts creep into the heads of their players. Whereas MINY have been there, done that and won the whole thing, so when it comes to the crunch win or bust games, they know how to get the job done. With that in mind, backing MI New York to win should be seriously considered, the question is whether it will be by enough of a margin to see them through to the play-offs.",
    "summary": "**Match Details:**\nThe article discusses an upcoming match between Los Angeles Knight Riders and MI New York in the Major League Cricket tournament. The match is scheduled to take place on July 21, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\n\n**Current Form:**\nLos Angeles Knight Riders have won their last match and need one more win to guarantee a spot in the eliminator. MI New York, on the other hand, have lost three games in a row and require a significant net-run-rate swing to overhaul Los Angeles and qualify for the play-offs.\n\n**Importance of the Match:**\nThe outcome of this match will decide the fate of both teams. A win for MI New York by a sufficient margin could send them into the play-offs, while a defeat would knock them out of the tournament. Los Angeles Knight Riders, on the other hand, need to win to avoid missing the play-offs for the second consecutive season.\n\n**Key Players:**\nThe article highlights the importance of players like Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Dewald Brevis, and Trent Boult in the match. These players could have a significant impact on the outcome of the game.\n\n**Expert Prediction:**\nThe expert predicts that MI New York will play fearlessly and aggressively, given the desperate situation they are in. This could lead to a fired-up and focused MI New York performance, but also carries the risk of reckless cricket costing them the game.",

    "date": "Mon Jul 22 02:55:00 2024",
    "body": "It's not just about the cricket or the money, Cummins explains, but the opportunity to think about his career after cricket\n\nMatt Roller\n\n22-Jul-2024 • 6 hrs ago\n\n1:50\n\nCummins: MLC is giving cricketers a platform in the US\n\nPat Cummins does not make Major League Cricket sound like a tough sell. \"It was like, 'do you want to come to the US for a few weeks in summer, be around a team where I'm good mates with a few of the guys, play a bit of golf and play a bit of cricket in a new country',\" he tells ESPNcricinfo from Dallas. \"I jumped at it.\"\n\nYet his lucrative four-year contract with San Francisco Unicorns was a paradigm of change in the cricket world. Cummins had only previously played in one overseas T20 league - the IPL - but his interest was piqued by the identity of the franchise's owners: Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, a pair of India-born venture capitalists based in California.\n\nFive injury-ruined years early in his career made Cummins acutely aware that professional sport is transitory. He studied business at Sydney's University of Technology during his prolonged rehabilitation, sits on the Australian Cricketers' Association's board of directors, and has used his platform to advocate for action on climate change.\n\nIt is why the owners' Silicon Valley background was the clincher for him. \"It's a space that I find super interesting, particularly the venture-capital world,\" Cummins says. \"I potentially see that as something I'd like to do more of post-cricket, so [this is] a way to align with a few of those guys, learn off them over the next few years, be around some of those conversations.\"\n\nThe tournament effectively provides him with a chance to network: since arriving in the US, Cummins has already \"informally\" discussed potential opportunities over coffee. \"If it's something I do enjoy, hopefully I could dive a little bit deeper for the back-end of my career, and then maybe move into that space a bit more professionally after cricket.\"\n\n\"For the guys that play all three formats, you're always trying to make sure you're peaking for those major events - and it feels like there's been about ten major events in the last 18 months, so I haven't really taken much time to reinvest back in my body\"\n\nPat Cummins\n\nCummins' contract with Unicorns runs until 2027. By then, he will be 34 and closer to the end of his international career. \"The intention is definitely to make this a long-term partnership,\" he says. \"Obviously playing for Australia, it's going to clash at certain times. But outside of that, I want to make sure MLC is a real focus.\"\n\nMLC remains at a nascent stage, with just 25 matches shared across two venues. But its combination of high salaries, a short window, and the novelty of playing in the US have proved attractive. Its pool of overseas players comfortably outstrips that of rival leagues, including the Hundred in England. \"I hadn't thought of the Hundred,\" Cummins admits.\n\nCummins makes it clear that, as Test and ODI captain, \"playing for Australia will come first\". Cricket Australia only made him available for four out of six MLC group games this year to manage his workload after the T20 World Cup, and his availability for the 2025 edition will depend on a potential clash with a two-match Test series in the Caribbean.\n\nHe has also been rested for Australia's white-ball tour to Scotland and England in September, giving him a prolonged break ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Tellingly, that decision received minimal pushback.\n\n\"Everyone's a little bit more realistic about the schedules nowadays,\" Cummins says. \"We spend ten-plus months of the year away on the road, so some tours probably carry a little bit more importance than others. For the guys that play all three formats, you're always trying to make sure you're peaking for those major events - and it feels like there's been about ten major events in the last 18 months, so I haven't really taken much time to reinvest back in my body.\"\n\n1:38\n\nCummins explains why he will miss the September tour to England\n\nJosh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc are part of September's tour, but Cummins had long planned to miss it. \"That window has always been earmarked as a time to really give my body a rest and do close to a full pre-season,\" he explains. \"I should get six or eight weeks off bowling and then build up again. Once this MLC opportunity came up and we mapped out the plan, it didn't really change much.\n\n\"I still get that same amount of break and then just probably start one or two weeks later heading into the summer… I'll get home, I'll have a good six or eight weeks off bowling where I'll get in the gym every day, do some running, and get some strength back into my body. And then we've got a big Test match series [against India] for our home summer, so that'll be the focus.\"\n\nCummins has only taken one wicket in three MLC appearances, but has helped Unicorns seal a top-two finish, closing out a win over MI New York on Friday night. \"It's a really high standard,\" he says. \"The calibre of players is ridiculous and for a competition in its second season, it's super organised and super competitive… I couldn't speak highly enough of it.\"\n\nAustralia played exclusively in the Caribbean during the T20 World Cup, but Cummins watched the US leg with interest: \"That Pakistan-India game looked insane… everyone talks about baseball, basketball and NFL, but there's hundreds of thousands of cricketers here going about their work quietly who are now starting to get a platform.\"\n\nUnicorns' long-term ambition is to bring MLC to California, with plans to build a stadium in San Jose. \"Hopefully that will be ready to go in the next couple of years, and I'll be coming back to San Fran a lot,\" Cummins says. That sentence alone from Australia's captain is proof that cricket has changed for good.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",
    "summary": "* Australian cricketer Pat Cummins has signed a four-year contract with San Francisco Unicorns in the MLC, a decision influenced by the franchise's venture-capitalist owners from Silicon Valley, with whom he wants to learn and network.\n* Cummins views MLC as an opportunity to think about his career after cricket, potentially moving into the venture-capital space.\n* MLC offers high salaries, a short window, and the novelty of playing in the US, making it attractive to players. The tournament has a strong pool of overseas players, surpassing rival leagues like the Hundred in England.\n* Cummins will prioritize playing for Australia, but aims to make MLC a long-term focus, with his contract running until 2027.\n* The tournament is still in its early stages, with only 25 matches played across two venues, but has been well-organized and competitive.\n* The Unicorns' long-term plan is to bring MLC to California, with a proposed stadium in San Jose, which Cummins hopes to see come to fruition in the next couple of years.",

Except for Ryan Rickelton, no other batter showed any promise whatsoever. The big names like Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen and Aaron Jones, all failed to get going. Rickelton smashed 89 off 52 balls but he barely got any support at the other end. Once he got out in the 19th over, it was all clear that Orcas will not reach a decent total. They were littled and only scored 142 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Sunil Narine as usual got out cheaply. Jason Roy tried his best to take control but he consumed too many balls for his knock of 27 runs. A real game changing innings was played by Unmukt Chand, who smashed 62 runs off 47 balls. He was aided by the lower order batters who contributed healthily and helped LA Knight Riders get over the line in the 20th over with 4 wickets in hand.\n\nBatting Stats T20\n\nCurrent Form MI New York:\n\nMI New York are currently placed at the 5th position on points table with 1 win and 4 losses to their credit.\n\nThe top run scorer for MI New York in the Major League Cricket is Nicholas Pooran with 137 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for MI New York in the Major League Cricket is Rashid Khan with 7 scalps under his belt.\n\nMI New York have lost their previous match against San Francisco Unicorns by a small margin of 3 runs.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns batted first and they posted a total of 148 for 7 in 20 overs. The top order struggled a lot. Their prime form batters including Matthew Short and Josh Inglis got out cheaply. They were under a lot of pressure from that moment on. The middle order of San Francisco Unicorns came good as Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan smashed 59 and 44 runs respectively to help San Francisco Unicorns get to a strong total of 148 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, MI New York lost Ruben Clinton quite early into the innings. Dewald Brevis played like a champion and he smashed 56 runs off 36 balls. He instilled the hope for a successful chase. Nicholas Pooran also supported him well, he scored 26 runs but consumed too many balls to get going. It cost the team dearly. The rest of the middle order batters including Romario Shepherd and Monank Patel failed terribly and despite the efforts of Heath Richards, who smashed 24 off 13 balls, Seattle Orcas failed to achieve the target and fell short by 3 runs in the end.\n\nWicket Takers T20",

    "body": "Right then, that was it from our coverage of the nail-biting qualification match between MI New York and Los Angeles Knight Riders. It was MI New York who took home the win and qualified in the fourth spot for the playoffs. However, we will be back with more coverage of the Major League cricket on 23rd July. It will be a top-of-the-table clash between San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom. The first ball will be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT) but our coverage will start much earlier. Until then, goodbye and cheers!\n\nKieron Pollard the skipper of MI New York is up for a chat. He says that he is happy and congratulates his entire team for their performance. Adds that they were good with the bat in this tournament but the results were not in their favor. Mentions that this win was a complete team performance and it gave a lot of confidence to everyone. Ends by saying that their hard work paid off and will perform well further as well.\n\nSunil Narine, the captain of the Los Angeles Knight Riders is up for a chat. He says that they were some runs short and the innings by Pooran and Pollard took the game away from them. Jokes that he will have to improve his skills at the toss. Adds that batting first is always tough but it was a good tournament for them. Mentions that they tried their best and appreciates his bowlers for giving it their all. Ends by saying that they will keep fighting and that he is happy with the team balance.\n\nRashid Khan is the Player of the Match for his impactful bowling spell. He says that the win was a much needed one. Adds that the wickets he took were crucial. Adds that it was all about bowling in the right areas and that went well. Says that everything went perfect for him. Ends by saying that they will look to carry on with the momentum and try to win the next game.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw the Los Angeles Knight Riders batters struggling against MI New York. Trent Boult, Nosthush Kenjige, and Rashid Khan got wickets and put the Knight Riders in a tough spot. However, a late boost by Andre Russell took them to a competitive total and gave some relief to their bowlers.\n\nNicholas Pooran says that he is happy with the win and they believed. Adds that they have been in similar situations before and they did well. He says that Kieron Pollard played the role of finisher well and he has all the experience. Ends by saying that they will give their best in the playoffs.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders executed their plan well. The pacers troubled the batters initially and Spencer Johnson gave them the opening wicket. Corne Dry soon followed and cleared the path for the rest of the bowlers. Sunil Narine and Andre Russell put further pressure with quick wickets. Johnson was shown a glimpse of vintage Pollard and that over, changed the momentum of the game. Ali Khan got rid of Pooran but the damage was already done. They couldn't make the cut this year but will hope to make a strong comeback next year.\n\nMI New York had a struggling start to their innings. They had to chase down the target in 18.2 over to qualify and Ruben Clinton couldn’t get going. He succumbed under pressure and so did Dewald Brevis. Nicholas Pooran couldn’t find an ideal partner to attack from both ends as Monank Patel, Heath Richards, and Romario Shepherd also crumbled under pressure. Kieron Pollard was at his best and he hit three sixes in Spencer Johnson’s one over to get his team right back in the game. In the end, Rashid Khan and Kieron Pollard sealed the game in their favor. The defending champions will once again have the chance to compete for the coveted trophy.\n\nMI NEW YORK HAVE MANAGED TO QUALIFY FOR THE PLAYOFFS! After a struggling run so far, the team in blue have made the cut when it mattered the most. The Los Angeles Knight Riders will have to try again next year as the top 4 are sealed in now.\n\n4\n\nOvers16.6\n\nScore134 - 6\n\nCorne Dry to Rashid Khan, FOUR! MI New York have qualified for the play-offs! On a length and on the pads. Rashid Khan gets a faint edge on it and the ball races away to the fine leg fence for a boundary.\n\n0\n\nOvers16.1\n\nScore128 - 6\n\nCorne Dry to Kieron Pollard, Short and on off, Kieron Pollard slaps it back towards the bowler who just manages to get t his right hand to it and drops it. A difficult chance though.\n\nTime Out! MI New York have lost Nicholas Pooran here but it won't matter much. They just need 5 runs off 16 balls to qualify for the playoffs.

Facing the experienced Smith, Bravo bowls a slower delivery that proved a masterclass in deception.\n\nAnticipating a faster ball, Smith had committed himself early and moved significantly outside off stump. Bravo’s slower ball was expertly disguised and delivered with precision, skirting close to the stumps. Brought off balance by the change of pace, Smith attempted to swipe across the line but missed entirely, his shot falling well short of connecting.\n\nHowever, on the next delivery, he again used a subtle variation in pace and trajectory to induce an error from Smith. This time, Smith misjudged the ball and attempted a shot that resulted in a straightforward catch for Devon Conway behind the stumps. Smith’s innings ended at 57\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Nosthush Kenjige takes a spectacular catch to dismiss Finn Allen in MLC 2024\n\nFreedom batters shine\n\nAsked to bat first, Washington Freedom posted a strong total of 206/5 on the board.

And right from that first season, we saw big sixes, high scores, electrifying fielding, and much more.\n\nWhile we’ve spoken about the top bowlers and batters in this league, we’re going to list down all Major League Cricket centuries on this page. Since it’s a global league with top T20 players signed from USA and around the world, you’ll find players from different countries being a part of the MLC centuries list. Keep reading for more details…\n\nThe first ever Major League Cricket century was scored by South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen, proving why he’s known as one of the best cricketers in the world in this format. And right after him a few days later, we saw another highly sought T20 batter in Nicholas Pooran who bagged himself an MLC century, doing so in the all-important MLC 2023 final.\n\nSEE ALSO: List of top online sports betting websites\n\nPost that, we saw a couple of more South African players (Faf du Plessis and Ryan Rickelton) getting MLC centuries and when we last updated this page, there were a total of four (4) centuries in this league.

Not only was it scored at a 250 strike rate but it came in an important final when his team was down initially. It’s also the highest score in MLC’s short history so far, getting 137* in just 55 deliveries.\n\nTill date, Seattle Orcas is the only franchise to have multiple entries in the MLC centuries list thanks to tons from Klaasen and Rickelton. A few teams are few to enter this list but considering there’s plenty of successful seasons to come over the years, we expect more entries in this list over the years.\n\nThree of the four centuries scored in this tournament have ended on a winning note while Faf’s centuries in MLC 2024 went in vain as the match was washed out due to rain after his century in the first innings.

After struggling in last few games, MI bounced back. In a crucial match for MI New York, their key players delivered to secure a spot in the MLC 2024 playoffs. Rashid Khan was outstanding with 3 wickets for 22 runs, limiting LAKR to 130 runs. MI New York chose to bowl first on a slow pitch, and Trent Boult made an early impact by dismissing Sunil Narine in his first over.\n\nThe dismissal of Unmukt Chand during the middle overs was crucial, given the importance of spin on the pitch. By the halfway point, LAKR struggled at 62 for 4. MI New York’s spinners combined for 5 wickets for 44 runs in eight overs, causing a collapse in the LAKR innings.\n\nMI New York’s chase started well with Dewald Brevis scoring 27 off 19 balls, hitting five boundaries. However, both he and opening partner Ruben Clinton were out by the end of the 36-run PowerPlay. Kieron Pollard then sealed the victory with a powerful performance, smashing Spencer Johnson for three consecutive sixes.\n\nPollard’s Heart-Winning Gesture:\n\nDuring the match, a ball hit a fan’s shoulder after Kieron Pollard hit a giant six. At the post-match presentation, Pollard inquired about the fan. Later, he met the fan, signed an autograph, and took a selfie with them. The video of this interaction went viral, winning the hearts of netizens.\n\nDefending champions MI New York clinched a spot in the Major League Cricket 2024 playoffs with a solid 4-wicket win over the LA Knight Riders. This victory has finalized the playoffs lineup, setting up an exciting Eliminator match against the Texas Super Kings. The game will take place at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday.",

    "body": "In a thrilling encounter at the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) tournament, Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell lost his wicket to Afghanistan‘s Rashid Khan, trying a rash shot on a crucial game point. The match between Washington Freedom and MI New York saw Rashid’s guile and deception prove too much for the usually reliable Steve Smith and Maxwell.\n\nGlenn Maxwell’s aggression goes in vain\n\nMaxwell, known for his antics on the pitch, creative shots, and aggressive batting, has won many accolades with this style of play. However, Maxwell could not execute it in front of Rashid at that particular moment.\n\nAfghanistan’s legendary spinner delivered a masterclass in spin bowling, dismissing Washington Freedom’s skipper Smith and the destructive Maxwell. Bowling over the wicket, Rashid deceived Maxwell’s creative gameplay with a normal googly, which the Australian batter failed to read. The ball sneaked past Maxwell’s bat, crashing into the stumps and providing a crucial breakthrough for MI New York.\n\nHere’s the video\n\nMatch summary\n\nWashington Freedom secured a convincing 94-run victory over MI New York in their MLC encounter, booking their place in the playoffs. Batting first, Washington Freedom posted a challenging total of 182/5 in their 20 overs, with Travis Head and Andries Gous scoring half-centuries. Despite losing Maxwell to a brilliant delivery from Rashid, Rachin Ravindra’s late onslaught propelled Washington Freedom to a competitive score.\n\nIn reply, MI New York’s batting lineup crumbled under the pressure, with only two batters reaching double digits. Jasdeep Singh was the pick of the bowlers for Washington Freedom, claiming 3/14 with his pace. The other pacers, Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar, also made crucial contributions, taking two wickets each.\n\nAlso WATCH: Imad Wasim’s stunning one-handed catch dismisses Mukhtar Ahmed during SEO vs WAF in MLC 2024\n\nMI New York’s disappointing performance\n\nMI New York’s batting lineup failed to fire, with only two batters reaching double digits. The top six batters managed scores of 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, and 4, which is unacceptable in a T20 chase. The pitch had some assistance for the fast bowlers, and Washington Freedom’s pacers took full advantage of it.\n\nWashington Freedom’s all-round performance proved too much for MI New York, who struggled with both bat and ball. The victory secured Washington Freedom’s place in the playoffs and highlighted their potential to go all the way in the tournament.",

The southpaw continued unabated, scoring five fours and a six in just 10 balls, reaching his fifty in only 20 balls.\n\nHead’s carnage pushed us to 74/2 at the end of the sixth over, equaling the second-highest powerplay score of MLC 2024. Although we lost three wickets in quick succession, Maxwell and Smith rebuilt our innings, adding 58 off 42 balls and taking us past the three-figure mark.\n\nMaxwell was severe on the spinners, hitting all his boundaries—three sixes and a four—against the slower bowlers. After a cautious start, Smith shifted gears effortlessly, reaching his first fifty of the MLC in style with a reverse hit for four.\n\nSmith, who was at 24 off 25 balls initially, smashed 33 runs off the next 14 balls before getting dismissed in the penultimate over. Obus Pienaar provided the finishing touches, scoring an unbeaten 21-ball 33 to take us past 200. Noor Ahmad picked up 3/38 for Texas Super Kings whereas Dwayne Bravo got two wickets.\n\nIn response, Maxwell once again provided the crucial breakthrough dismissing Devon Conway. However, TSK raced to 76/1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nBut we bounced back, picking up four wickets and conceding just 29 runs in the next six overs. Player of the Match Jasdeep dismissed TSK skipper du Plessis, who was looking in good nick, immediately after his fifty, to tilt the odds heavily in our favour.\n\nOnce Marcus Stoinis holed out in the deep to be Jasdeep’s third victim, there was no looking back as we romped home for our fifth victory of the season. Jasdeep recorded figures of 3/25 to round off a clinical bowling display.\n\nWith 11 points from six matches, we continue to be on top of the MLC 2024 points table.\n\nWe are up against the San Francisco Unicorns in our last league match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Monday.\n\nWashington Freedom vs Texas Super Kings MLC 2024 brief scores: WF 206/5 in 20 overs (Steve Smith 57, Travis Head 53, Noor Ahmad 3/38, Dwayne Bravo 2/40) vs TSK 164/10 in 19.5 overs (Faf du Plessis 55, Calvin Savage 35, Rachin Ravindra 4/16, Jasdeep Singh 3/25).\n\nWashington Freedom won by 42 runs.",

The MLC 2024 game will be available to watch via live streaming and broadcast.\n\nWith a comprehensive 42-run win over the Texas Super Kings, our unbeaten run in MLC 2024 continued. We are on top of the points table with 11 points from six games.\n\nTravis Head and Steve Smith came up with contrasting half-centuries, while Rachin Ravindra picked up four wickets, and Glenn Maxwell and Jasdeep Singh each got three in an all-round performance against TSK.\n\nDespite missing the last two matches for us, Netravalkar continues to top the bowling charts in MLC 2024 with 12 wickets from just four matches at an average of 9.16 runs and an astonishing strike rate of 7.66.\n\nMeanwhile, Travis Head and captain Steve Smith continue their run in the top-five batters list this season.\n\nHead has amassed 194 runs from six matches at an average of 38.80 and an impressive strike rate of 179.62 to be third on the overall list, whereas Smith is one run below at fourth with 191 runs. He has an unbelievable average of 63.66, the highest for any player this season, and a strike rate of 136.42.\n\nWF vs SFU form in MLC\n\nComing into this contest, we are unbeaten in our last five matches in the MLC, winning four of them, with one game washed off due to rain.

However, Faf du Plessis and TSK rewrote both records during the chase. Head also has the most fifties by any player this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Smith endured a slow start to go big in the later stage guiding the team to its first 200-plus total in MLC. He also scored his first half-century in the process.\n\nJasdeep Singh won the Player of the Match for a second straight match with an impressive three-wicket haul. He was reintroduced into the attack after the powerplay when TSK were flying high.\n\nJasdeep brought us back into the match with a spell of 3/17 in his last three overs, including the wickets of the dangerous du Plessis and Aaron Hardy. Apart from Jasdeep, Rachin Ravindra recorded career-best T20 bowling figures picking up 4/16 and Glenn Maxwell also chipped in with three wickets.\n\nComing to our match against San Francisco Unicorns last season, Netravalkar won the match single-handedly for us with his splendid spell of fast bowling.

A par first innings total looks like being in the region of 180-190.\n\nRead on for team previews, betting tips, latest odds, and match prediction for Los Angeles Knight Riders vs MI New York, Major League Cricket 2024\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Team News & Playing 11\n\nLAKR Team News\n\nThe Knight Riders ended their long wait for a second win in this campaign with a four wicket victory with five balls remaining against bottom of the table Seattle Orcas in their last game. They now play next to bottom of the table MI New York in this clash.\n\nLAKR Team Batting\n\nKeeper-batter Unmukt Chand was the star with the bat for Los Angeles Knight Riders as they successfully chased down 143 to beat MI New York. However, only Jason Roy also got to 20 and with David Miller along with Sunil Narine also in the top four, the Knight Riders will be looking for a stronger team batting display.\n\nLAKR Team Bowling\n\nAli Khan and Waqar Salamkheil were the only two of Los Angeles Knight Riders’ six man bowling unit to go wicketless in the last match and Salamkheil was very expensive. However, they are both talented players and will look to the experienced pair of Sunil Narine and Andre Russell for tips ahead of this clash.\n\nLAKR Team Form\n\nIt was four matches without a victory before Los Angeles Knight Riders’ win in their last game.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Predicted Playing 11\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine (c), Unmukt Chand (wk), David Miller, Nitish Kumar, Saif Badar, Andre Russell, Corne Dry, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan, Waqar Salamkheil\n\nMI New York Team News & Playing 11\n\nMINY Team News\n\nWith only Seattle Orcas below them in the table, and only a one point cushion above them, it has been a desperately disappointing tournament for MI New York and they lost their last game by three runs against San Francisco Unicorns on Thursday.\n\nMINY Team Batting\n\nSouth African Dewald Brevis struck a quick-fire and impressive 56 runs from 36 balls in the last game and he made an exciting 77 for the second wicket with Nicholas Pooran. Captain Pooran has not been in the greatest form but his side need him to be at his best in this game if they are to progress up the table.\n\nMINY Team Bowling\n\nThere is no doubt that MI New York have a strong bowling attack and in spinner Rashid Khan along with left-arm opening bowler Trent Boult they have two of T20s all time best bowlers. Nosthush Kenjige comes into this game after an excellent performance with the ball in Dallas in Match 16.\n\nMINY Team Form\n\nMI New York have not won any of their last five matches in the 2024 MLC.\n\nMI New York Predicted Playing 11\n\nDewald Brevis, Ruben Clinton, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Kieron Pollard (c), Monank Patel, Romario Shepherd, Rashid Khan, Heath Richards, Sunny Patel, Nosthush Kenjige, Trent Boult",

They managed to win only one match out of the 5 games they participated in.\n\nThe top run scorer for LA Knight Riders in the previous edition was Andre Russell with 206 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for LA Knight Riders in the previous edition was Adam Zampa with 9 scalps under his belt.\n\nLA Knight Riders have retained their premium spinner Adam Zampa. He was the leading wicket taker for LA Knight Riders last season. They also have capable batters in Andre Russell, Jason Roy and David Miller. Sunil Narine, who is in the form of his life is also part of the LA Knight Riders squad.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Sunil Narine - He showed great signs of form in the recently concluded Indian Premier League. He can change the course of the match both with bat and the ball. Narine is expected to be LA Knight Riders' best player in the Major League Cricket.\n\n2. Jason Roy - He is an experienced campaigner who is capable of playing long innings and placing the opposition under pressure right from the word go.\n\nCurrent Form Texas Super Kings:\n\nTexas Super Kings finished at the 2nd position on points table after league stages of the previous edition. They lost to MI New York in the Challenger match and got knocked out.\n\nThe top run scorer for Texas Super Kings in the previous edition was Devon Conway with 221 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Texas Super Kings in the previous edition was Mohammad Mohsin with 9 scalps under his belt.\n\nTexas Super Kings have a relatively weaker squad compared to the other teams. They do match winners in their team like Gerald Coetzee, Daniel Sams and Devon Conway. However, their chances for making it to the Playoffs are bleak.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Faf du Plessis- He can hit the ball a long way and provide quick starts to his team in the powerplay overs. Faf du Plessis will play an important role for Texas Super Kings in the tournament.\n\n2. Mitchell Santner- He is a wily left arm spinner who doesn't leak runs and also has a knack of picking up wickets in the middle overs period.\n\nLet’s have a look at the squads\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nMartin Guptill, Jaskaran Malhotra, Alex Carey, Spencer Johnson, Saif Badar, Ali Sheikh, Andre Russell, David Miller, Unmukt Chand, Bhaskar Yadram, Ali Khan, Rilee Rossouw, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Sunil Narine, Jason Roy, Shakib Al Hasan, Gajanand Singh, Lockie Ferguson, Adam Zampa, Nitish Kumar\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nRusty Theron, Saiteja Mukkamalla, Imran Tahir, Calvin Savage, Faf du Plessis, Marcus Stoinis, Gerald Coetzee, Devon Conway, Milind Kumar, Zia Shahzad, Mohammad Mohsin, Matthew Tromp, Naveen-ul-Haq, Dwayne Bravo, Daniel Sams, Cody Chetty, Noor Ahmad,Sami Aslam, Mitchell Santner, Zia ul-Haq, Lahiru Milantha, Cameron Stevenson\n\nCricket Betting Tips and Match Predictions* - PrePlay\n\nWho will win the toss? – Texas Super Kings\n\nWho will win?- LA Knight Riders\n\nTop Batter (Runs Scored) - Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings), Jason Roy (LA Knight Riders)\n\nTop Bowler (Wickets taken) - Mitchell Santner (Texas Super Kings), Sunil Narine (LA Knight Riders)\n\nMost Sixes – Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings), Jason Roy (LA Knight Riders)\n\nPlayer of the Match- Sunil Narine (LA Knight Riders)\n\nTeam Scores Batting first – Texas Super Kings 140+, LA Knight Riders 150+\n\nMatch Handicap: LA Knight Riders\n\nLive Cricket Streaming Major League Cricket 2024: The live cricket streaming page which enables you to watch live cricket - Geo-restrictions apply\n\n*NB these predictions may be changed nearer the start of the match once the final starting teams have been announced and we will be running ‘In-Play’ features, so stay tuned.\n\n© Cricket World 2024",

    "date": "Tue Jul  2 21:49:31 2024",
    "body": "Bangladesh star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan said he preferred to make short-term plans rather than long-term ones, considering that the 37-year-old is in the twilight of his career.\n\nShakib left for the USA earlier today to take part in the upcoming season of Major League Cricket, starting on July 6. He will play for the Los Angeles Knight Riders and will then make the journey across the border to play for Bangla Tigers Mississauga in the Global T20 in Canada which will begin on July 25.\n\nFollowing the back-to-back franchise tournaments, Shakib will be expected to return to national colours in August when Bangladesh will tour Pakistan for a two-match Test series.\n\n\"I haven't really planned much. And I don't really have that much time to plan for three-four years. I think that it is good to plan for three months, or six months. So up until now, my planning goes as far as the Pakistan series,\" Shakib told reporters at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport before leaving for the USA on Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't have a plan regarding myself. At this moment, I'm looking forward to the two T20 tournaments, one is Major League Cricket for which I'm heading to the USA followed by the Global T20 League in Canada. I'll play these back-to-back tournaments and then will see where things are. After that, there is the Test series against Pakistan. So, my planning is about these three competitions.\"\n\nShakib has been going through a lean patch with both bat and ball. While his batting has left a lot to be desired in the past two ICC events (the 2023 ODI World Cup and 2020 T20 World Cup), his ability to strike with the ball, which has rarely come into question throughout his career, has taken a nosedive.\n\nIn an abysmal campaign in the recently concluded T20 World Cup, Shakib managed just 111 runs in seven matches at a strike-rate of 106.73. He did score a fifty against the Netherlands in their Super 8 run in the tournament but that was all that one would remember from his campaign. With the ball, he picked up three wickets at an economy rate of 7.50 and it was not until Bangladesh's fourth match of the group-stage against Nepal that the left-arm spinner was able to register his first wicket. He took two in the match and scalped one in a Super 8 fixture against India meaning he went wicketless in five matches in the major event.\n\nThe interesting part about Shakib's statement was that he was not particularly keen on long-term plans and it won't be a surprise if he is picky when deciding which matches to play in the upcoming series. There have been a few instances in which Shakib has opted out of Tests in the recent past.

Furthermore, it provides dependable customer support and a VIP programme. On MCW’s online casino, gamers can place bets whenever they want and from any location, unlike traditional casinos. Players can receive incentives for different amounts of money, and there are no time constraints or conventional gaming conventions.\n\nLee Yong Fuk, Chief Marketing Officer at Mega Casino World, said, “MCW players are cricket mad and they love what they’re seeing from MLC. The quality on show and its global appeal continues to build a major following, so it makes perfect sense for MCW to partner with the Unicorns, the league’s most ambitious brand. With Pat Cummins and global superstars signed for this season, the Unicorns have put their cards on the table and staked their claim to the trophy early, and we’re fully behind them in their mission to bring home its first Major League Cricket championship.”\n\nDavid White, General Manager of San Francisco Unicorns, added, “MCW has a huge community of fans and bettors based in the Asia Pacific region and we can’t wait to show their cricket fans what the Unicorns can do on the pitch come July 7. It’s great to have the support of a brand with such wide appeal in MCW for our shirt sponsorship this season. We have major ambitions to grow in the Bay Area and as a force worldwide, and with big name signings and first-class partners, we’re well on our way to making this a reality for the 2024 season and beyond.”\n\nFans of the Unicorns in approved regions who are of legal age will be able to gamble on all competition matches, including pre-match and in-play, via MCW’s sportsbook and cricket exchange.\n\nRecently, the team also announced a partnership with the Bay Area Cadillac Group, in which Dublin Cadillac, Fremont Cadillac, and Stevens Creek Cadillac have become the team’s official luxury vehicle partners for the upcoming MLC season.",

Shakib Al Hasan said that he is only planning up to the Pakistan series and will reassess his situation after playing in the Major League Cricket (MLC) and Global T20 League in Canada.\n\nBangladesh is scheduled to play two Tests and three T20Is against India from September 19 to October 12, after their tour of Pakistan in August, where they will play a two-match Test series. The first Test will be played in Chennai on September 19, followed by the second Test in Kanpur on September 27.\n\nDon't Have Many Plans - Shakib Al Hasan\n\nShakib Al Hasan left Dhaka for the USA on Monday to join the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the upcoming Major League Cricket. The 37-year-old all-rounder mentioned that he has short-term plans of three to six months rather than long-term planning.\n\n\"I don't have many plans. There are two T20 tournaments in front of me one is MLC and the other one is the Global T20 League in Canada and let me see where I stand after playing these two tournaments because I need to understand [how I feel],\" Shakib told reporters.\n\n\"There is international cricket and there is a series against Pakistan and I am planning till that point of time and not planning beyond that. Now I don't have time to plan for three-four years and so planning for three to six months is better and later will think about my next plan and so till now I am planning till the Pakistan series,\" he added.\n\nShakib had a disappointing outing with both bat and ball in the recently concluded T20 World Cup 2024.

The left-arm spinner managed to secure three wickets at an economy rate of 7.50 in the World Cup.\n\nIt Was Difficult To Pick Taskin Ahmed - Shakib Al Hasan\n\nShakib Al Hasan revealed that pace bowler Taskin Ahmed apologized to his teammates for missing the game against India. Shakib stated that Taskin arrived just minutes before the toss, making it challenging to include him in the team.\n\n\"When Taskin arrived it was five to 10 minutes before the toss and certainly it was difficult to pick him at that point in the team and it was difficult for him as well. Taskin apologized to the team for that afterward and everyone in the team took it normally because a man can mistakes and anyone can commit unintentional mistakes and he accepted it and the thing ended at that point in time,\" Shakib said.\n\nBangladesh made a questionable team selection by excluding vice captain Taskin Ahmed in the Super 8 fixture against India. According to Cricbuzz, Taskin missed the match due to arriving late because of oversleeping. He returned for the next match against Afghanistan and took one wicket for 12 runs in his four overs.\n\nBangladesh were eliminated from the World Cup without securing a single victory in the Super Eight stage during the World Cup in the West Indies and the United States of America (USA). The Bangladesh team lost to Australia, India, and Afghanistan in the Super 8 matches.",

It was glory and triumph in equal numbers as they etched history to win the first-ever Major League Cricket title.\n\nThe core of the team remains the same as the likes of Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard and Trent Boult will be the key members to watch out for. Undoubtedly, they have one of the strongest and most formidable sides in this competition.\n\nSeveral USA cricketers in the form of Monank Patel, Steven Taylor and Shayan Jahangir will be players to watch out for as Kieron Pollard and co. look to defend their title.\n\nIn this article, we take a look at 3 reasons why MI New York can defend their title in Major League Cricket 2024:\n\n1. Well-rounded balanced side\n\nMI New York have a lot of superstars in their team and all of them would be looking to sparkle together in order to win something big in the 2nd edition of the Major League Cricket 2024.\n\nThe batting department has some big guns in the form of Nicholas Pooran, Tim David and Kieron Pollard. On the other hand, the bowlers in the form of Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult and Sunny Singh will be looking to leave a mark.\n\n2. Able leadership\n\nMI New York’s captain Kieron Pollard has served the Mumbai-branch of the MI franchise for 14 long seasons and is also the present batting coach of Mumbai Indians. He is a vastly experienced campaigner and has won a lot of titles in this T20 franchise cricketing career.\n\nPollard had sustained a shoulder injury in the last league game of MI New York in the previous edition and therefore Nicholas Pooran, had to don the captain’s hat.\n\nThe swashbuckling southpaw led the team extremely well and also played a jaw-dropping innings in the finals to lift the title. Pooran had smashed 137* runs in 55 deliveries and had sent shockwaves down the spines of the opposition team.\n\n3. Quality domestic talent\n\nMI New York have USA’s cricket team’s captain Monank Patel in their ranks and also have Steven Taylor. Both these players had a good outing in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and would be confident of good performances in this competition.\n\nLeft-arm orthodox spinner Nosthush Kenjige will be another key talent to watch out for and he has grown in confidence, in the last few years. Kenjige had bagged 3 wickets in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 for USA.",

The team has able leadership in Kieron Pollard, a vastly experienced campaigner with a successful track record in T20 franchise cricket. Nicholas Pooran, who led the team to victory in the finals, is also a strong captain.\n3.

With its inaugural season played in 2023, the MI New York were the standout performers in the league and went on to be the champions under skipper Nick Pooran, who played a stunning hand in their title victory.\n\nWith some very crucial signings, especially with the drafting of several Australian maestros ahead of the 2nd edition, the MLC will be a contest worth witnessing.\n\nWith a new set of players, along with the retained players from the first season, let’s take a look at the Top 5 batters who stand a chance to score the highest runs ahead of MLC 2024.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTop 5 batters who stand a chance to score the highest runs ahead of MLC 2024\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have drafted the big Australian for their 2024 MLC campaign. The last time semifinalists had already had quite some spectacular performers in their team sheets, while Stoinis will be an in-form inclusion to the side.\n\nThe big Australian was a commanding performer in the Indian Premier League and also performed overwhelmingly for his national side in the T20 World Cup. Stoinis, who has evolved to be a middle-order batter, letting go of his role as a finisher has helped sides retain him, and his evolving bowling skills are a cherry on top.\n\nQuinton de Kock\n\nThe South African veteran, who announced his retirement from the Tests and ODIs, has been a constant surprise in the shortest format of the game. He has been a part of every global T20 league since he stopped featuring for the Proteas.\n\nPlaying for the Seattle Orcas, QDK scored 264 runs, averaging a brilliant 44 in the 7 games of the tournament. He is one of the most worthy retentions of the MLC 2024, and his contributions are supposed to be of great value to his team. In short, the veteran can once again be found among the top scorers of the league.\n\nYOU MAY LIKE IT: IND vs ZIM: 3 bowlers to watch out for in India’s tour of Zimbabwe who can be assets in the T20 World Cup 2026\n\nJ.Fraser-McGurk\n\nThe hard-hitting youngster from Australia is now gaining the status of a world-class T20 batter due to his fearless stride and fast run-scoring in the powerplay, for which he has often received praise and recognition from players around the world.\n\nFeaturing for the Delhi Capitals in the IPL 2024, McGurk was one of the very reasons the Capitals bounced back in the later stages of the competition. Though he was not the most consistent performer, he added fire to the innings whenever he got going in the powerplay.\n\nSuch will be his role, as the 21-year-old is about to make his debut in yet another league featuring players of global standard. Picked by the San Francisco Unicorns, McGruk will be most probably seen alongside Finn Allen, and together they can be the most explosive opening pair of MLC 2024.\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nThe West Indies wk-bat has been a constant performer over the recent few years, in whichever league he has played in. From playing in the IPL for Lucknow Super Giants to making vital contributions to his team’s score in the T20 World Cup, Pooran is one of the most reliable batters to keep your cards on.\n\nThe small-packet dynamite is often seen hitting massive sixes; it was his blistering knock of 137 runs on just 55 balls that included 13 sixes, which took MI New York over the line, and they went on to be the champions of the debut season. Not only MI New York but the entire cricket world would hope to witness such brilliance from the Windies batter.\n\nTravis Head",
    "summary": "The second edition of the MLC is set to begin on Saturday, with the MI New York being the defending champions after winning the inaugural season in 2023 under skipper Nick Pooran. Several Australian players have been drafted into the tournament, making it an exciting contest to watch. The article highlights the top 5 batters who are likely to score the highest runs in MLC 2024, including:\n\n1. Marcus Stoinis, who was drafted by the Texas Super Kings and is expected to perform well after his impressive showings in the Indian Premier League and the T20 World Cup.\n2. Quinton de Kock, who will play for the Seattle Orcas and is expected to continue his good form in the shortest format of the game.\n3. J. Fraser-McGurk, a young Australian batsman who is making his MLC debut with the San Francisco Unicorns and is known for his fearless and fast-scoring abilities.\n4. Nicholas Pooran, the West Indies wicketkeeper-batsman who is a consistent performer in various leagues and was instrumental in MI New York's title win in the inaugural season.\n5. Travis Head, an Australian batsman who is expected to perform well in the tournament.\n\nOverall, the article suggests that MLC 2024 is shaping up to be an exciting tournament with a strong lineup of players.",

Their knockout phase of the tournament did not go to plan as they were dumped out in the Challenger by eventual winners MI New York.\n\nSuper Kings' captain Faf du Plessis will be keen to lead his side on the field and with the bat at the top of the order. He has already reached seven scores of 50-plus this year.\n\nNew Zealander Devon Conway was one of three retained players for Texas Super Kings. His 221 runs in the Texas Super Kings' 2023 Major League Cricket season would be the biggest reason why the franchise want him in their colours again.\n\nBowling all-rounder Mohammad Mohsin could be a vital component of the Super Kings' bowling lineup. The leg-spinner was their highest wicket-taker in 2023.\n\nTexas Super Kings Playing 11\n\nPlaying 11 not yet available.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders ended in last position on the table in 2023. They only managed a single victory in their season. Shakib Al Hasan is a long-standing member of the Knight Riders family.\n\nHe has represented Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League which included the teams of 2012 and 2014 which won the tournament. The LA Knight Riders will also have Sunil Narine to choose from.\n\nThe West Indian all-rounder was voted as the most valuable player at the 2024 Indian Premier League. Adam Zampa is right up there as one of the best T20 bowlers in the world.\n\nThe leg-spinner will no doubt make an impact for his new franchise.

Both captains may be swayed to bat second.\n\nRead our guide on toss predictions to learn how we analyze and come up with our tips.\n\nPitch and Conditions\n\nTemperatures are expected to be scorching with a high level of humidity.\n\nIt is highly unlikely to rain on matchday.

Conditions should be similar for both sides.\n\nTSKS vs LAKR Betting Tips\n\nLast season showed that the Texas Super Kings know what it takes to make it far in the tournament. They will want to go one better this year and at least make it to the final.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders had a season to forget in 2023. They have boosted their chances in 2024 with some explosive additions to their squad.\n\nThey will want to emulate the success this year of their Kolkata namesake.

They were bowled out for just 124 in 19.4 overs before Freedom cruised through with an eight-wicket victory. The Orcas currently sit at the bottom-of-the-table.\n\nLAST THREE: LWLLW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: MUST REACT FROM THUMPING\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns come into this one on the back of their own shaky start to the 2024 Major League Cricket season. Their most recent played match, ignoring the abandonment against the Los Angeles Knight Riders, saw them hammered by the Texas Super Kings with the Unicorns being bowled out for just 127 before TSK chased it in 12.5 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: ALWLL\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Seattle Orcas have reshuffled their top order already in this tournament with Quinton de Kock moving down to three behind Ryan Rickelton and Nauman Anwar. De Kock has been in poor form for some time now, though, and the Orcas’ best bet of getting runs has been via captain Heinrich Klaasen with Klaasen scoring 30+ seemingly always a good option.\n\nIt is a fairly weak attack that the Orcas possess with the likes of Imad Wasim, Nandre Burger, Cameron Gannon, Harmeet Singh and Zaman Khan providing little potency. That said, it is South African Burger that has often looked to be the most controlled and Burger to be the Orcas’ top bowler would be a reasonable shout.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIt is a modern day top order for the San Francisco Unicorns and it is a top order that should look to threaten most bowling attacks. Josh Inglis has been demoted down to five with Sanjay Krishnamurthi moving up but neither of those players their biggest threat. That falls on the shoulders of Matthew Short and whilst the Australian is hit and miss so 30+ is not always as likely as the aforementioned Klaasen, he is likely to be the Unicorns’ top batter in the match.\n\nHaris Rauf and Liam Plunkett are symbols of what is an ageing and actually ineffective Unicorns’ bowling attack. Abrar Ahmed appears more suited to Test cricket so the responsibility to take two or more wickets in the match is actually on Hassan Khan.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThis is a weird game because both sides found their batting line-ups totally outplayed in previous matches, both being bowled out for fairly low scores. However, their respective bowling attacks would appear to be the weakest sections of their sides on paper. That means, with a response needed from both, it could end up being a surprisingly high scoring match and if that is the case then the Unicorns’ top order should be tipped to out score their opposition most times.",

They lost three wickets in quick succession, including that of the dangerous Nicholas Pooran (1), inside the powerplay. The situation worsened when skipper Kieron Pollard (5) fell cheaply, leaving MINY at 52/5 in 11.2 overs.\n\nAt this stage, the match appeared firmly in TSK's grasp. However, Rashid Khan (50) walked out to the middle and injected much-needed energy into the innings. His aggressive approach stabilized the innings and brought out the best in Monank Patel (61). The pair found boundaries at regular intervals, turning the tide on TSK.\n\nThe duo held on to a 97-run stand for the 6th wicket, giving MINY a glimmer of hope. However, Dwayne Bravo's experience came to the fore. In the crucial 19th over, he conceded just 8 runs, which effectively sealed the game for the Texas Super Kings. Despite the late scare, TSK managed to hold their nerve and secure a 15-run win.\n\nEarlier in the day, Faf du Plessis took full advantage of the powerplay, smashing the MI New York bowlers across the field. His aggressive approach paid off with a quickfire fifty, setting a strong foundation for the Super Kings as they ended up scoring 176/6.\n\nThe breakthrough for MI New York came in the 9th over when left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was introduced into the attack. Despite being expensive, Kenjige managed to dismiss du Plessis, who was caught at long-on by Tim David while attempting another big hit, having scored 61 in 38 balls.\n\nNew Zealand’s Devon Conway provided valuable support with a handy knock before Faf’s dismissal, but he fell short of his fifty, getting dismissed for 40 by Ehsan Adil in the 14th over. The Super Kings then faced a mini-collapse, losing key wickets. Then, Marcus Stoinis stepped up towards the end with some lusty blows, propelling the Super Kings past the 175-run mark.\n\nIn the bowling department, MI New York had their moments. Rashid Khan was the standout performer, maintaining an economical spell with figures on 1/17. Trent Boult also claimed a couple of wickets but was quite expensive on the day.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-85 (Faf du Plessis - 8.5 ov), 2-121 (Devon Conway - 13.1 ov), 3-127 (Aaron Hardie - 14.1 ov), 4-138 (Joshua Tromp - 16.1 ov), 5-143 (Milind Kumar - 16.5 ov), 6-160 (Calvin Savage - 18.1 ov)\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-14 (Ruben Clinton - 1.5 ov), 2-17 (Nicholas Pooran - 2.6 ov), 3-27 (Steven Taylor - 3.5 ov), 4-39 (Kieron Pollard - 8.4 ov), 5-52 (Tim David - 11.2 ov), 6-149 (Rashid Khan - 19.2 ov), 7-157 (Monank Patel - 19.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nNaveen ul Haq\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nMI New York\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nMonank Patel\n\nTim David\n\nSteven Taylor\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nRashid Khan\n\nRuben Clinton\n\nTrent Boult\n\nKagiso Rabada\n\nEhsan Adil\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Monday, July 15, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: MI New York elected to bowl",

This impressive performance highlights Washington Freedom's strong position in the tournament.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nWashington Freedom vs Los Angeles Knight Riders, Match 11\n\nWashington Freedom 130/2 (16 ov)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders 129/10 (18.4 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom won by 8 wickets\n\nSCORECARD\n\nManhattan\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nWashington Freedom defeated Los Angeles Knight Riders by eight wickets to register their third consecutive victory of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Church Street Park, Morrisville on Sunday.\n\nWashington’s Saurabh Netravalkar (4/35) and Glen Maxwell (3/15) were exceptional with the ball, ensuring the Los Angeles Knight Riders were restricted to 129/10. In the second innings, a hard-hitting knock from Travis Head (54) and a composed innings from Steven Smith (42*), helped the Washington Freedom romp home with four overs to spare.\n\nThe Washington Freedom dominated the run chase from the outset. Openers Travis Head and Steven Smith ensured an explosive powerplay, with Head clearing the ropes effortlessly. By the end of six overs, Washington Freedom were well ahead at 61/0. While Steven Smith batted cautiously, Travis Head reached his half-century in just 27 balls, including six maximums. However, Shadley Van Schalkwyk broke the 79-run partnership by dismissing Head in the ninth over.\n\nRachin Ravindra (11) then joined Steven Smith, who began to accelerate, adding 29 runs together. However, the pace and bounce of Spencer Johnson deceived Ravindra in the 13th over, leaving the score at 109/2. Andries Gous (15) and Steven Smith comfortably saw the team through the remainder of the innings, finishing at 130/2 in just 16 overs.\n\nEarlier in the day, the LA Knight Riders’ innings began disastrously, as they found themselves at 39/4 during a tempestuous powerplay. Saurabh Netravalkar struck early, removing Sunil Narine (0) and Unmukt Chand (1) in the second over. The collapse continued with Shakib Al Hasan (0) bowled by Glenn Maxwell and Jason Roy (12) dismissed by Lockie Ferguson.\n\nAttempting to stabilize the innings, Nitish Kumar(11) and Saif Badar (35) forged a 44-run partnership. Badar counter-attacked, taking 17 runs off Netravalkar in one over, including two consecutive sixes, during his 35-run knock. However, both batsmen fell in quick succession—Badar to Ravindra and Kumar to Maxwell.\n\nAndre Russell looked dangerous, smashing 20 runs off just 12 deliveries before Maxwell claimed him as his third wicket of the day. The very next over saw Lockie Ferguson dismiss David Miller (1), leaving the Los Angeles Knight Riders struggling at 89/8 in 13.1 overs.\n\nThe tail-enders fought valiantly to push the score to a competitive total. Shadley van Schalkwyk remained unbeaten on 12*, while Spencer Johnson (16) and Ali Khan (11) added crucial runs before Netravalkar returned to wrap up the innings with two more wickets. The LA Knight Riders were bowled out for 129 in 18.4 overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Fall of wickets: 1-10 (Sunil Narine - 1.1 ov), 2-12 (Unmukt Chand - 1.6 ov), 3-13 (Shakib Al Hasan - 2.3 ov), 4-18 (Jason Roy - 4.2 ov), 5-62 (Saif Badar - 9.4 ov), 6-66 (Nitish Kumar - 10.2 ov), 7-87 (Andre Russell - 12.3 ov), 8-89 (David Miller - 13.1 ov), 9-107 (Spencer Johnson - 15.3 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-79 (Travis Head - 8.2 ov), 2-108 (Rachin Ravindra - 12.5 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nTravis Head\n\nSteven Smith\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nIan Holland\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nUnmukt Chand(WK)\n\nDavid Miller\n\nJason Roy\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nSaif Badar\n\nShakib Al Hasan\n\nAndre Russell\n\nShadley van Schalkwyk\n\nSunil Narine(C)\n\nAli Khan\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Sunday, July 14, 2024 20:30\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville",

Netravalkar and the spinners bowled well to keep the pressure on Los Angeles Knight Riders throughout the innings.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders just did not have enough on the board! They created a few chances but it just did not go their way. They though will be disappointed for the speed at which they let their opposition score the runs. They were completely outplayed by much better side on the day.\n\nA thumping win then for Washington Freedom and they remain unbeaten. 130 was never going to be a challenge for them.

Faf du Plessis-led side has won two games, lost one and one of their games was abandoned.\n\nChasing a target of 177, MI New York faced early setbacks due to Marcus Stoinis' devastating bowling spell. They lost three crucial wickets in quick succession, including that of the dangerous Nicholas Pooran (1), all within the powerplay. The situation worsened when skipper Kieron Pollard (5) fell cheaply, leaving MINY reeling at 52/5 in 11.2 overs.\n\nAt this stage, the match appeared firmly in TSK's grasp. However, Rashid Khan (50) stepped onto the field and injected much-needed energy into the innings. His aggressive approach stabilized the innings and brought out the best in Monank Patel (61). The pair found boundaries at regular intervals, turning the tide against TSK.\n\nThe duo held on for a 97-run stand for the 6th wicket, giving MINY a glimmer of hope. However, Dwayne Bravo's experience came to the fore in the crucial 19th over, where he conceded just 8 runs, effectively sealing the game for the Texas Super Kings. Despite the late scare, TSK held their nerve and secured a 15-run win.\n\nEarlier in the day, Faf du Plessis capitalized on the powerplay, smashing the MI New York bowlers across the field. His aggressive approach paid off with a quickfire fifty, setting a strong foundation for the Super Kings, scoring 176/6.\n\nThe breakthrough for MI New York came in the 9th over when left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige was introduced into the attack. Despite being expensive, Kenjige managed to dismiss du Plessis, who was caught at long-on by Tim David while attempting another big hit, having scored 61 in 38 balls.\n\nNew Zealand's Devon Conway provided valuable support with a handy knock before Faf's dismissal, but he fell short of his fifty, getting dismissed for 40 by Ehsan Adil in the 14th over. The Super Kings then faced a mini-collapse, losing key wickets, but Marcus Stoinis stepped up towards the end with some powerful shots, propelling the Super Kings past the 175-run mark.\n\nIn the bowling department, MI New York had their moments. Rashid Khan was the standout performer, maintaining an economical spell with figures of 1/17. Trent Boult also claimed a couple of wickets but was quite expensive on the day.",

In the second innings, a hard-hitting knock from Travis Head (54) and a composed innings from Steven Smith (42*), helped the Washington Freedom romp home with four overs to spare.\n\nThe Washington Freedom dominated the run chase from the outset. Openers Travis Head and Steven Smith ensured an explosive powerplay, with Head clearing the ropes effortlessly. By the end of six overs, Washington Freedom was well ahead at 61/0. While Steven Smith batted cautiously, Travis Head reached his half-century in just 27 balls, including six maximums. However, Shadley Van Schalkwyk broke the 79-run partnership by dismissing Head in the ninth over.\n\nRachin Ravindra (11) then joined Steven Smith, who began to accelerate, adding 29 runs together. However, the pace and bounce of Spencer Johnson deceived Ravindra in the 13th over, leaving the score at 109/2. Andries Gous (15) and Steven Smith comfortably saw the team through the remainder of the innings, finishing at 130/2 in just 16 overs.\n\nEarlier in the day, the LA Knight Riders’ innings began disastrously, as they found themselves at 39/4 during a tempestuous powerplay. Saurabh Netravalkar struck early, removing Sunil Narine (0) and Unmukt Chand (1) in the second over. The collapse continued with Shakib Al Hasan (0) bowled by Glenn Maxwell and Jason Roy (12) dismissed by Lockie Ferguson.\n\nAttempting to stabilize the innings, Nitish Kumar(11) and Saif Badar (35) forged a 44-run partnership. Badar counter-attacked, taking 17 runs off Netravalkar in one over, including two consecutive sixes, during his 35-run knock. However, both batsmen fell in quick succession—Badar to Ravindra and Kumar to Maxwell.\n\nAndre Russell looked dangerous, smashing 20 runs off just 12 deliveries before Maxwell claimed him as his third wicket of the day. The very next over saw Lockie Ferguson dismiss David Miller (1), leaving the Los Angeles Knight Riders struggling at 89/8 in 13.1 overs.\n\nThe tail-enders fought valiantly to push the score to a competitive total. Shadley van Schalkwyk remained unbeaten on 12*, while Spencer Johnson (16) and Ali Khan (11) added crucial runs before Netravalkar returned to wrap up the innings with two more wickets. The LA Knight Riders were bowled out for 129 in 18.4 overs.",

    "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 is about to witness a significant boost as Australian skipper Pat Cummins is set to join the San Francisco Unicorns. The 31-year-old speedster is no stranger to American soil, having recently participated in the T20 World Cup held in the USA and West Indies.\n\nCummins' commitment to the San Francisco Unicorns is substantial, with a four-year deal in place. This move is particularly noteworthy as Cummins has limited experience in overseas T20 leagues, having only played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) previously. The right-arm pacer picked 18 wickets in 16 games at an average of 31.44 and an economy of 9.27 in this edition of the cash-rich league.\n\nHis last appearance in Australia's domestic T20 competition, the Big Bash League, dates back to the 2018-19 season, primarily due to his international commitments.\n\nThe timing of Cummins' arrival couldn't be better for the Unicorns, who have struggled this season with only one victory in three matches. The pacer's recent form has been exceptional, including his historic back-to-back hat-tricks in the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nAlso read: How Pat Cummins’ love for technology lured him to Major League Cricket\n\nHis leadership skills were also on display when he guided Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL final. With an impressive T20 record of 172 wickets in 151 matches at an average of 26.66 and an economy rate of 8.11, Cummins is expected to significantly bolster the Unicorns' bowling arsenal.\n\nThe Australian skipper's addition to the team also witnesses the departure of West Indies all-rounder Sherfane Rutherford, who is unable to continue in the MLC due to a family bereavement. This personnel change is likely to alter the team's dynamics and strategy in the upcoming matches.\n\nOther teams also have made changes in their squad, with Ottneil Baartman replacing Gerald Coetzee (injury) at Texas Super Kings and Lungi Ngidi coming in for Wayne Parnell (player withdrawal) at Seattle Orcas.",

On the other hand, San Francisco holds the fourth position and has won one game in three matches, with a negative NRR of 0.631.\n\nOrcas are coming off a five-wicket-defeat against table-toppers Washington Freedom. The side will look to bounce back in the coming game and go ahead on the points table. Meanwhile, Unicorns won their first game of the tournament and lost their second game to Texas Super Kings.

However, a key concern is the batting tempo in the second innings, as the ball's pace slows down upon hitting the surface.

    "body": "The Major League Cricket 2024 is going on in the USA, with popular players from different nations joining in the play. The tournament started on 5 July, 2024, the day after USA celebrated its independence and will go on until 28 July. While the season is midway, Australia‘s star cricketer Pat Cummins is set to join San Francisco Unicorns in MLC.\n\nCummins signed a four-year deal with the franchise. The 31-year-old has mainly played in the IPL among overseas T20 leagues and has been absent from Australia’s Big Bash League since the 2018–19 season due to his international commitments.\n\nCummins joins the San Francisco Unicorns midway during the MLC\n\nPat Cummins is set to return to the USA for the MLC 2024. Cummins played the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 in the USA and West Indies for Australia. Cummins’ arrival comes as Sherfane Rutherford departs. The hard-hitting West Indies allrounder, who has not participated in any of the Unicorns’ matches this season, will miss the rest of the Major League Cricket (MLC) due to a bereavement in his family.\n\nThis change marks a significant shift for the team, which hopes Cummins will fill the gap left by Rutherford’s absence.\n\nOther teams in the MLC are also experiencing roster changes. Ottneil Baartman will replace Gerald Coetzee in the Texas Super Kings. Gerald is sidelined due to an injury.\n\nBaartman’s inclusion is to bolster the team’s bowling attack as they navigate through the remainder of the season.

Parnell’s withdrawal required a swift response, and the team believes Ngidi’s experience and skills will be crucial in maintaining their competitive edge as they advance in the MLC.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns look for a fate change\n\nPat Cummins’ arrival in the team is expected to mark the comeback for the San Francisco Unicorns. The Unicorns have won just one of their three games this year, and they will benefit greatly from the addition of Cummins.\n\nKnown for his impressive performances, Cummins made history by securing back-to-back hat-tricks at the T20 World Cup. Before that, he led Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL final.\n\nHis experience and skill will help provide a much-needed boost to the team. Sun Risers Hyderabad got to the IPL 2024 finals but lost the season to Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nCummins brings a wealth of experience, having played 151 T20 matches and taken 172 wickets with an average of 26.66 and an economy rate of 8.11.\n\nHis consistent performance in T20 cricket makes him a valuable asset for the Unicorns. The team hopes his presence will enhance their bowling attack and improve their standings as the season progresses.",
    "summary": "* The MLC 2024 tournament is currently underway in the USA, running from July 5 to July 28.\n* Australia's star cricketer Pat Cummins has signed a four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns and will join the team midway through the tournament.\n* Cummins' arrival comes as Sherfane Rutherford departs due to a bereavement in his family, and the team hopes Cummins will fill the gap left by Rutherford's absence.\n* Other teams in the MLC are also experiencing roster changes, with Ottneil Baartman replacing Gerald Coetzee in the Texas Super Kings due to an injury, and Lungi Ngidi taking over from Wayne Parnell in the Seattle Orcas.\n* The San Francisco Unicorns, who have won only one of their three games this year, are expecting a turnaround with Cummins' arrival, given his impressive T20 cricket record of 151 matches, 172 wickets, and an economy rate of 8.11.\n* The team hopes Cummins' experience and skill will enhance their bowling attack and improve their standings as the season progresses.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom extended their unbeaten run in Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 with a comprehensive eight wicket victory over Los Angeles Knight Riders in Morrisville. Opting to bowl first on a slow pitch, Freedom’s bowlers capitalized on the conditions, restricting Knight Riders to a modest total of 129.\n\nThe decision to bowl first proved to be a masterstroke, as the pitch offered just enough assistance to keep the Knight Riders batters in check, leading to a comfortable chase for Freedom.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar’s bowling masterclass\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar, who had been a standout performer in the recent T20 World Cup, showcased his prowess with a phenomenal spell, returning figures of 4/35. He struck twice in his opening over, removing Sunil Narine with a perfect full length delivery that knocked over his stumps and Unmukt Chand with a short pitched ball.\n\nBy the fifth over, Knight Riders were reeling at 18/4, with Jason Roy and Shakib Al Hasan also back in the pavilion. Roy was caught at deep midwicket trying to clear the boundary, while Shakib was bowled through the gate by a beautifully disguised slower ball. Saif Badar attempted to stabilize the innings with a cautious 35, playing some elegant shots and rotating the strike effectively. However, his dismissal – trapped LBW by a skidding delivery from Rachin Ravindra – triggered another collapse.\n\nAlso READ: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024: Complete squads of all six teams\n\nSteve Smith’s remarkable catch off Glenn Maxwell’s bowling\n\nGlenn Maxwell then tightened the screws with his accurate off-spin, finishing with figures of 3/15. His spell included the crucial wicket of Andre Russell, who looked dangerous during his brief stay at the crease. Russell, trying to accelerate the scoring, was caught at long-on, failing to clear the boundary. And then, Steve Smith‘s exceptional fielding claimed the wicket of Nitish Kumar.\n\nOn the third ball of the eleventh over, Maxwell bowled a delivery pitched on a length at middle stump. Nitish attempted to clear the ropes but failed to achieve the desired elevation. The ball went towards short mid-wicket, where Smith timed his jump perfectly and took a stunning airborne catch.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nPowerful batting seals the win for Washington Freedom\n\nAfter that Lockie Ferguson added to the pressure with his express pace, taking two wickets in quick succession, ensuring that LAKR folded with eight balls left in their innings.\n\nIn the chase, Travis Head and captain Smith provided a solid start, amassing 61 runs in the powerplay. Head was particularly aggressive, scoring 40 off just 23 balls, smashing six sixes in his 32-ball 54. Despite his dismissal, which led to a slight dip in the scoring rate, Smith anchored the innings with an unbeaten 42. His composed knock ensured that Freedom chased down the target comfortably, with eight wickets and four overs to spare, maintaining their perfect start to the season.",
    "summary": "**Match Result:** Washington Freedom defeated Los Angeles Knight Riders by 8 wickets in Morrisville.\n\n**First Innings:** Los Angeles Knight Riders were bowled out for 129 runs, thanks to a brilliant bowling performance by Washington Freedom.

    "body": "Australia superstar Steve Smith is currently plying his trade for Washington Freedom in the ongoing second season of the Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nThe tournament marked his return to competitive cricket as a player after a long time. Steve Smith had not played a competitive game since the Christchurch Test against New Zealand in March. He did not play in the IPL as he was not picked up by any franchise in the auction but he did ply his trade as a commentator. The right-handed batsman was also not a part of Australia's squad for the T20 World Cup last month.\n\nHe finally returned to action earlier this month in the ongoing MLC 2024. The former Australia skipper has looked in good touch with the bat so far. And on Sunday (July 14), he once again showed that he is still one of the sharpest fielders in the game as he pulled off a stunning catch during the game between Washington Freedom and Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nOn the second ball of the 11th over, Glenn Maxwell bowled a flighted delivery on the pads to Nitish Kumar and the Knight Riders batter decided to hit the ball through the mid-wicket area. However, the USA batter failed to keep his shot down and paid a price for it as Steve Smith came up with a brilliant effort to catch the ball and send him back.\n\nWatch the catch from Steve Smith:\n\nTalking about the game, Washington Freedom thrashed the Knight Riders by 8 wickets. Asked to bat first, the Knight Riders were bowled out for just 129 runs. At one stage, they were reeling at 89 for 8 before the lower-order players guided them to a respectable total.",

    "date": "",
    "body": "During the Major League Cricket match between the Los Angeles Knight Riders and Washington Freedom at Church Street Park in Morrisville on Sunday, Andre Russell delivered a powerful ball that struck Travis Head’s bat with such force it broke the bat in two. Despite this, Head showed incredible resilience, continuing his impressive performance to score 54 runs off just 32 balls, hitting 2 fours and 6 sixes.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders, having been sent in to bat by Washington Freedom’s captain Steve Smith, managed to score only 129 runs in 18.4 overs. This was largely due to superb bowling by Saurabh Netravalkar, who took 4 wickets for 35 runs, and Glenn Maxwell, who took 3 wickets for 15 runs.\n\nWhile chasing the target of 130 runs, Washington Freedom’s openers Head and Smith provided a strong start with a partnership of 79 runs, making the run-chase easy. However, in the second over of their innings, Russell bowled a fast, short-pitched delivery that broke Head’s bat into two pieces as he attempted a pull shot. The ball hit the upper part of the bat, leaving Head with just the handle while the rest of the bat flew towards mid-wicket.\n\nThis unexpected incident left Head visibly surprised, and his reaction went viral on social media. Nonetheless, Head went on to score 54 runs off 32 balls, helping Washington Freedom secure a magnificent eight-wicket win.\n\nAfter the match, Head commented, “The pitch was on the slower side and took more spin than previous games. It was nice to get a few good shots and secure a win. It felt great to play the entire match and get some luck. The crowd’s energy was amazing, and it helped us maximize our performance when Smithy and I were batting. I’m looking forward to the rest of the tournament.”",

Fixtures\n\nMajor League Cricket Teams\n\nReady to dive into the action with the best Major League Cricket betting sites? Here, we give the lowdown on all the MLC 2024 teams, including their strengths and weaknesses, to enable you to place more informed bets on the tournament. Importantly, to stay abreast of the latest news and team updates, check out this space on ESPNcricinfo.\n\n1. MI New York\n\nCaptain: Kieron Pollard\n\nOverseas players: Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran and Romario Shepherd (West Indies), Kagiso Rabada, Dewald Brevis and Anrich Nortje (South Africa), Tim David (Australia), Rashid Khan (Afghanistan), Trent Boult (New Zealand)\n\n2023 Standing: Champion\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Nicholas Pooran (388)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Trent Boult (22)\n\nKey players: Nicholas Pooran, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan\n\nTeam analysis: The defending champions have the most balanced squad on paper, which consists of several hard hitters, quality pacers, and a spin wizard in Rashid Khan. They have retained most of their core squad from last season and have also roped in USA national team captain Monank Patel. They are the frontrunners to retain the trophy for the second successive season.\n\n2. Los Angeles Knight Riders\n\nCaptain: Sunil Narine\n\nOverseas players: Spencer Johnson and Alex Carry (Australia), Jason Roy (England), Sunil Narine and Andre Russell (West Indies), Shakib Al Hasan (Bangladesh), Waqar Salamkheil (Afghanistan), Joshua Little (Ireland), David Miller (South Africa)\n\n2023 Standing: Last\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Andre Russell (206)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Adam Zampa (9)\n\nKey players: Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Ali Khan\n\nTeam analysis: They had a disappointing season last year, finishing at the bottom of the table and winning only one match. This year, however, they have made some good signings. Most of their overseas players are in great form, with many of them winning T20 leagues around the world. With a perfect combination of aggressive batters, all-rounders, and domestic talent, they have a great chance of turning things around and becoming the Major League Cricket champions in 2024.\n\n3. Washington Freedom\n\nCaptain: Steve Smith\n\nOverseas players: Marco Jansen (South Africa), Lockie Ferguson and Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand), Akeal Hosein (West Indies),\n\nSteve Smith, Jack Edwards, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Andrew Tye (Australia)\n\n2023 Standing: 3rd\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Matthew Short (152)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Saurabh Netravalkar (10)\n\nKey players: Saurabh Netravalkar, Akeal Hosein, Travis Head\n\nTeam analysis: Washington Freedom came in third last season, losing to MI New York in the eliminator. In a total revamp, they have filled their squad with bona fide T20 stars, including as many as five Australians who can destroy any opponent on a given day. With the induction of Lockie Ferguson, Andrew Tye, and Akeal Hosein, they have also bolstered their bowling lineup. Importantly, they also have an excellent domestic crop of players.\n\n4. San Francisco Unicorns\n\nCaptain: Corey Anderson\n\nOverseas players: Finn Allen and Matt Henry (New Zealand), Haris Rauf and Abrar Ahmed (Pakistan), Sherfane Rutherford (West Indies), Matthew Short, Josh Inglis, Pat Cummins and Jake Fraser-McGurk (Australia)\n\n2023 Standing: 5th\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Corey Anderson (190)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Liam Plunkett (7)\n\nKey players: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Sherfane Rutherford, Pat Cummins\n\nTeam analysis: Having finished fifth last season, the San Francisco Unicorns have made some sweeping changes to their overseas roster. They have got all their bases covered this season, signing aggressive openers, excellent middle-order batters, and T20 specialist pacers in their ranks. However, when it comes to their domestic recruits, the team does look slightly weak on paper.\n\n5. Texas Super Kings\n\nCaptain: Faf du Plessis\n\nOverseas players: Faf du Plessis and Aiden Markram (South Africa), Dwayne Bravo (West Indies), Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner (New Zealand), Noor Ahmad and Naveen ul Haq (Afghanistan), Marcus Stoinis (Australia), Matheesha Pathirana (Sri Lanka)\n\n2023 Standing: 2nd\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Devon Conway (221)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Mohammad Mohsin (9)\n\nKey players: Mohammad Mohsin, Marcus Stoinis, Faf du Plessis\n\nTeam analysis: A star-studded side with quality players, the Texas Super Kings came in second in the group stage last year, eventually losing to MI New York in the challenger. They have an excellent bowling lineup; however, they seem to have missed the bus when it comes to choosing their batsmen. With Devon Conway an uncertain starter due to his injury, they hardly have any T20 specialist batters this time around.\n\n6. Seattle Orcas\n\nCaptain: Wayne Parnell\n\nOverseas players: Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, Wayne Parnell, Nandre Burger and Ryan Rickelton (South Africa), Zaman Khan and Imad Wasim (Pakistan), Obed McCoy (West Indies), Michael Bracewell (New Zealand)\n\n2023 Standing: Runner-up\n\n2023 Highest runscorer: Quinton de Kock (264)\n\n2023 Highest wicket-taker: Cameron Gannon (11)\n\nKey players: Heinrich Klaasen, Cameron Gannon, Imad Wasim\n\nTeam analysis: The 2023 Major League Cricket runner-up, the Seattle Orcas had to let go of many overseas players this time. Yes, they have a good bowling department, but their batters, barring Heinrich Klaasen, are either not in form or at the tail end of their careers. Everything considered, we do not expect the Orcas to reach the playoffs.\n\nMajor League Cricket (2024): Overview\n\nThe 2024 MLC (also called the Cognizant Major League Cricket for sponsorship reasons) is only the second edition of this franchise T20 cricket league, and will be held from (IST) July 6 – 29, 2024.\n\nThe league was established by the American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in the United States in 2019. The first season of the competition was played in 2023.\n\nMuch like the previous season, the 2024 chapter of the Major League Cricket will be hosted across two venues: Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas (Texas) and Church Street Park in Morrisville (North Carolina).\n\nIn May 2024, MLC announced it had obtained a List A status (one of the three major forms of the sport recognised by the ICC) for all the fixtures in the tournament.\n\nA total of six teams will participate in the competition: Los Angeles Knight Riders (captained by Sunil Narine), MI New York (Kieron Pollard), San Francisco Unicorns (Pat Cummins), Seattle Orcas (Wayne Parnell), Texas Super Kings (Faf du Plessis), and Washington Freedom (captain TBD).\n\nThe tournament will follow this structure: a total of 21 round-robin matches, followed by the playoffs.\n\nThere will be three playoff matches: eliminator (3rd vs 4th), followed by a qualifier (1st vs 2nd, the team that wins qualifies for the final), and finally the challenger (the loser of the qualifier meets the winner of the eliminator, with the winner going to the final).\n\nThe final will be played on July 29 (IST).\n\nEach team can choose a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 19 players in its squad, including a maximum of nine overseas players.\n\nMI New York are the defending champions, having won the inaugural MLC season in 2023.\n\nNicholas Pooran (388) and Trent Boult (22) are the tournament's top run-getter and wicket-taker, respectively. Both play for MI New York.\n\nHow To Bet on The Major League Cricket\n\nStep 1: Choose your preferred MLC betting site from the bookmakers we've recommended here.\n\nStep 2: Click on ‘Sign Up’ or ‘Register’.\n\nStep 3: Fill in your personal details, set a username and password, and click on ‘Submit'.\n\nStep 4: Your betting account is now ready.\n\nStep 5: Now, log in and don’t forget to claim your sports welcome bonus.\n\nStep 6: Choose ‘Cricket' from the sportsbook and then select the Major League Cricket match you wish to bet on.\n\nStep 7: Choose a suitable betting market for that game, look for the best odds, and place your wager.\n\nMajor League Cricket: Best Live Betting Sites\n\n1. Melbet\n\nWith multiple live betting markets available for every game, Melbet is widely preferred for live betting on the Major League Cricket. The intuitive interface adds to the convenience; the cash-out option gives you control over your bets; and the high-quality livestreaming feature has a multi-view option that lets you stream several matches simultaneously.\n\nThat said, the absence of a quick-bet feature is a bit of a letdown.\n\n2. 10CRIC\n\nThe bookmaker arguably offers the most competitive odds for pre-match wagers across tournaments, but is equally adept if you wish to place live bets. The 10CRIC sportsbook is tailored to cricket betting and Indians, with competitive in-play odds, an excellent live betting interface that neither lags nor takes time to update, and a mix of several in-play markets to choose from. The cash-out option comes in handy as well.\n\nRegrettably, the bookmaker does not offer livestreaming as of the day of writing. That said, you find detailed match statistics and a seamless ball-by-ball live simulation, both of which are helpful in their own right.\n\n3. Parimatch\n\nThe Parimatch live betting interface is definitely better than decent. You can watch live action, make quick analyses of events, and place your bets on the game while it's still unfolding in the middle. The live betting odds also update promptly and without any interruption, contributing positively to the overall experience.\n\nHowever, much like 10CRIC, Parimatch does not have a livestreaming option at this time. But the platform somewhat makes up for it by providing exhaustive match statistics and a ball-by-ball live simulation.\n\nMajor League Cricket: Popular Betting Markets\n\nMatch Winner: Predict the winner of any MLC game.\n\nTop Team Batsman: Predict who you think will be the top runscorer for his team in any match.\n\nTop Team Bowler: Predict who you think will be the top wicket-taker for his team in any match.\n\nPlayer of the Match: Predict who you think will be the Man of the Match in a particular game.\n\n1st Dismissal Method: Bet on the way the first batsman in an innings will be dismissed.\n\nFirst Ball of the Match: Bet on the outcome of the first ball of the game.\n\nTo Score 50+ Runs: ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ if you think any batsman will score a half century or more in a game.\n\nTo Score 100 Runs: ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ if you think any batsman will score a century in a game.\n\nMost Boundaries: Bet on the team or player who will hit the most boundaries in a game.\n\nMost Sixes: Bet on the team or player who will hit the most sixes in a game.\n\nMajor League Cricket 2024 Schedule\n\nBelow is the full Major League Cricket schedule for 2024.

    "body": "Earlier this year, the World Cup-winning Australia captain confirmed that he had signed a deal to play in the second season of Major League Cricket in the USA, with the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nCummins missed the side's first three matches as he took an extended rest following the 2024 T20 World Cup, which saw Australia fail to make the semifinals. He arrived in time to make his MLC debut in the Unicorns' fourth match of the campaign, against Seattle Orcas.\n\nSan Francisco batted first and scored 165-7. Matthew Short top-scored with a solid 56, and quickfire contributions came from Finn Allen (34) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (30). Cummins batted at No.8, and remained not out on six.\n\nIn the run chase, Seattle had made a sedate start, getting to 22-0 in 4 overs. Cummins came on to bowl the fifth over, and started with a fullish off-cutter on leg-stump. Left-hander Ryan Rickleton duly obliged the loosener, swinging through the line and sending the ball over long-on to welcome Cummins.\n\nThe over ended up going for 14 runs. Cummins did recover, though, and finished with 1-35 from his four overs, dismissing Shehan Jayasuriya in the 11th over.

    "body": "Right then, this is it from Match number 13 where the momentum shifted back and forth in favor of both sides, but eventually, it was the San Francisco Unicorns who held their nerves and emerged victorious. Up next in the Major League Cricket, 2024 is another exciting clash in Match number 14. It will be MI New York going tooth and nail against Washington Freedom at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas. That game will be played on July 17th, Wednesday and the first ball will be bowled at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT). Till then take care, and cheers!\n\nCorey Anderson, the victorious skipper of San Francisco Unicorns says that it was a good outing overall. Says that the new ball came on nicely but mentions that when it slowed down, it got tough to play the strokes. Appreciates Sanjay Krishnamurthi and says that he is a young lad and he played a good crucial cameo. On Pat Cummins, he says that Cummins is a world class player and just to have him in the group is a huge luxury. Adds they will plan how to plan the next game at Dallas and would look to get on a roll now.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, the captain of Seattle Orcas says that they didn't bat well once again and lost key players at the back end. Says they need to close games out responsibly. Says the bowlers have been fantastic but the batters need to step up big time. He says a win here and there can hopefully flip things for them.\n\nLiam Plunkett wins the PLAYER OF THE MATCH Award for his brilliant bowling figures (4-0-26-3). He says that the way the Seattle Orcas batted inside the powerplay, it looked like going one way but after the break, they came back strongly. Adds it got more and more tough to get along as the ball got older. Ends up saying it was all about trying to execute their plans and maximizing that phase.\n\nMatthew Short is in for a chat. He says that it felt nice to bat there. Adds that he feels good about batting in the first six overs. Mentions that Ryan Rickelton and Quinton de Kock were in form but the wicket was in his favour. Says that Rickelton was in fine form but thinks the wicket was spinning and was a bit skiddy as well. Adds they have been a bit unlucky with the rain. Says in a short tournament like this, every game is critical. Says that they are looking forward to their following games and will look to win them.\n\nEarlier in the game, the Unicorns were asked to bat first and had a bit of a rocky start. JFM was gone in a flash, but then Matthew Short and Finn Allen teamed up for a fireworks display, smashing 75 runs together and sending the score rocketing. But the game twisted as both fell in quick succession and suddenly the boundaries dried up. Cameron Gannon and Imad Wasim spotted their chance and pounced. While their teammates were getting a bit of a hammering. They snagged three wickets each, tightening the screws on the Unicorns' innings. Just when it looked like the Unicorns might fizzle out, Krishnamurthy charged in for some last-minute heroics. His late blitz helped push the total to a respectable 165, which realistically made the difference in the end.\n\nOn the flip side, the Unicorns must have felt that they were short of 10-15 runs. They needed a wicket desperately but couldn't get any breakthrough inside the restrictions. As many as six bowlers were used in the powerplay but they couldn't find that scalp. But the tide turned dramatically when Plunkett finally cracked the code, grabbing the first wicket. Short quickly followed suit, and then Cummins, despite leaking runs, struck gold by dismissing the well-set Jayasuriya. This trio of wickets swung the momentum, with the Unicorns cleverly using slower deliveries to keep the Orcas off-balance. The bowlers then literally ran through the opposition lineup giving away next to nothing and closed up in fine fashion.\n\nHowever, as the innings progressed, the Orcas found themselves lagging behind the asking rate with Jayasuriya too, back in the hut. Just when they needed a steady partnership to ease the mounting pressure, they kept losing quick wickets with all the hitters back in the hut without any impact. The inning that once looked in absolute command suddenly lost its momentum in a jiffy in the mid overs and just couldn't recover from the collapse.\n\nDone and dusted! The San Francisco Unicorns seal the deal winning this clash by 23 runs and climbing to the third spot. A job well done by the Men in Orange and Blue. The Seattle Orcas on the other hand will be gutted with the way things panned out for them towards the second half of the chase. The Seattle Orcas kicked off their chase of 166 with a measured approach. Shehan Jayasuriya and Ryan Rickelton got things rolling nicely, forming a steady opening partnership and pouncing on any loose deliveries. Jayasuriya, in particular, was the aggressor in chief as he was timing the ball to perfection, making it look effortless. Even as wickets tumbled at the other end, Jayasuriya stood firm, notching up a solid resilient half-century.\n\nThe Orcas are heading up for their third defeat of the season here and it would be interesting to see how they recover from this in their latter games. However, this game was really under control in the first half with Jayasuriya going hammer and tonks, but they certainly lost the momentum in the next half.\n\nPat Cummins (3-0-30-1) is back into the attack to bowl the last over of his quota. With 33 runs needed off the 11 remaining deliveries, and all the recognised batters into the sheds, the chances of Orcas getting through have zeroed now.\n\nWith Harmeet Singh back in the hut, the tensions further deepen and things have gotten precarious for the Orcas now. They still need 38 off the last 18 remaining deliveries. Cameron Gannon is the next batter in at number 8. Haris Rauf (2-0-23-0) is back into the attack.\n\nW\n\nOvers16.6\n\nScore128 - 6\n\nLiam Plunkett to Harmeet Singh, OUT! TAKEN! Matthew Short with an excellent running catch at deep mid-wicket. Short, on middle, Singh pulls it from closer to the body and hence, he fails to generate the requisite power and the distance as gets the timing completely wrong. It carries towards deep mid-wicket where Matthew Short takes a sharp catch running to his left.\n\n4\n\nOvers16.5\n\nScore128 - 5\n\nLiam Plunkett to Harmeet Singh, FOUR! Edgy but they will take it! Short, on off, Singh looks to pull it but gets a top edge as the ball flies over short fine for a boundary.\n\nStrategic Break! This has been a fabulous comeback from the San Francisco Unicorns with the ball. What looked like a lopsided affair at the beginning of the chase, has turned out to be a nail biting one. With all the big hitters back in the hut, Orcas are still in the hunt of 53 off the last 30 remaining deliveries. Every bowler from the Unicorns has struck timely scalps and helped their team sneak back into the contest. Will Corey Anderson and Co manage to squeeze their opposition further, or will Harmeet Singh play a heroic here? Let's find out together. Corey Anderson (2.2-0-13-1) to continue after the break.\n\n1\n\nOvers14.5\n\nScore110 - 5\n\nPat Cummins to Harmeet Singh, On a length and on off, Singh looks to flick it but gets a leading edge as the ball carries and lands safely at mid on. They cross.\n\n4\n\nOvers14.3\n\nScore109 - 5\n\nPat Cummins to Harmeet Singh, FOUR! They need more of these! Touch short and on off, Harmeet Singh looks to pull it but gets a top edge as the ball goes over the keeper's head for a boundary.",

On the other hand, Seattle Orcas' captain, Heinrich Klaasen, lamented his team's batting woes and hoped for a turnaround in their next games.\n\nNext up is Match 14 between MI New York and Washington Freedom at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, scheduled for July 17th, at 6 am IST (12.30 am GMT).",

Saurabh Netravalkar (4), Glenn Maxwell (3), and Lockie Ferguson (2) got the valuable wickets.

Their bowlers then ran riot, skittling MI New York for just 88 runs, securing a commanding victory by 94 runs. With this win, Washington Freedom became the first team to qualify for the Playoffs of the second season, consolidating their lead at the top of the points table with nine points in five matches.\n\nMI New York had a terrible start to their run chase as Washington Freedom bowlers ran riot. They were 25/5 by the end of the Powerplay. Steven Taylor (0 off 3), Monank Patel (4 off 6), Dewald Brevis (2 off 5), Shayan Jahangir (3 off 9) and Nicholas Pooran (4 off 6) had lost their wickets cheaply by the sixth over.

Shepherd, the last hope for New York, was dismissed in the 11th over after scoring 25 off 14 balls. Maxwell then wrapped things up for Washington, taking two wickets in the 14th over. He removed Boult (16 off 13) on the first ball and Ehsan Adil (0 off 2) on the third to bowl out MI New York to just 88.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, the Washington team had a decent start, thanks to their openers, Steve Smith and Travis Head. However, Smith couldn't capitalize as he was dismissed by Rashid Khan in the fifth over, scoring 8 off 10. Head then took charge and built a solid partnership with Andries Gous. Their timely boundaries and steady play helped Washington cross the 100-run mark in the 11th over.\n\nHowever, Head's blistering knock of 54 off 33 balls, featuring nine fours and two sixes, came to an end in the next over when he was caught by Rashid Khan at long-on off Romario Shepherd. Glen Maxwell soon followed Head back to the pavilion, despite being given a lifeline in the 15th over when Taylor dropped him at mid-off. Rashid Khan eventually dismissed Maxwell in the 16th over, with him managing to score 15 off 14 balls. After 16 overs, Washington stood at 133/3, with Andries Gous still in the middle.\n\nWashington finished their innings strongly, as they scored 49 runs in the last four overs, thanks to the free-flowing strokes of Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra. Gous reached his half-century in the 19th over, while Ravindra smashed two sixes and a four off Boult in the same over, producing as many as 23 runs. Ravindra was dismissed by Kieron Pollard on the third ball of the final over after a quickfire 31 off 14 balls.

    "body": "Major League Cricket: Australia selector George Bailey has long-term plans for pacers Lance Morris and Jhye Richardson, after missing out on the white-ball tour of the UK. The duo were given Cricket Australia central contracts earlier this year.\n\nMorris missed the whole winter season due to a stress fracture in his back, and he is currently undergoing further rehabilitation for the same. It is a recurrence of what transpired following his exclusion from the Ashes trip in the 2022–2023 season.\n\nThe pacer had earlier sustained a side strain in his second ODI match, which curtailed his summer. He had been due to play for Seattle Orcas in ongoing Major League Cricket before scans revealed a hot spot in his back and as a result, he was not selected for the Scotland and England trip.\n\nTrending\n\n\"Lance is still working through his return to play and getting himself right recovering from that stress fracture of the back,\" ESPNcricinfo quoted national selector George Bailey as saying. \"Know he's progressing well, he's feeling good, he's starting to get to that point where he wants some cricket and think he's going to get a hell of a lot of it over the summer and that will be really exciting to see him back.\n\n\"Felt a little bit like with him, that we wanted to set him up for success in the long term as opposed to pushing that too early then potentially risking what we think is something that could be really exciting across this summer and beyond,\" he added.\n\nOn the other hand, Richardson is \"fit and firing\" as per Bailey after his disrupted stints in the Indian Premier League and domestic season due to a side strain. He last played for Australia against Sri Lanka in mid-2022.\n\n\"Jhye is in a similar boat. He's fit and firing now, and again looking for match opportunities. I think he'll get opportunities again across the summer. For both [him and Morris] I think it's getting through the season fit and then hopefully maximising the amount of cricket they play. Some of that will be domestic, hopefully, there will be some international opportunities [and] Australia A opportunities, then I think we set them up for success in the long term,\" he said.\n\nAustralia's national selector added that the dominance of the pace trio of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Josh Hazlewood with Scott Boland making inroads with some stunning performances in Test cricket.\n\n\"Jhye is in a similar boat. He's fit and firing now, and again looking for match opportunities. I think he'll get opportunities again across the summer.

    "body": "Impressive half-centuries by Travis Head and Andries Gous, along with a dominant bowling performance, led Washington Freedom to a crushing victory over MI New York by 94 runs in their fifth match of the Major League Cricket 2024 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Tuesday. Head scored 54 off 33 balls, while Gous smashed 59 off 48 to power Washington Freedom to 182/5 in 20 overs. The bowlers then skittled MI New York for just 88 runs, securing a commanding win. Washington Freedom's victory makes them the first team to qualify for the Playoffs of the second season, consolidating their lead at the top of the points table with nine points from five matches.\n\nMI New York faced a disastrous start in their run chase as Washington Freedom bowlers wreaked havoc. By the end of the Powerplay, they were reeling at 25/5. Steven Taylor (0 off 3), Monank Patel (4 off 6), Dewald Brevis (2 off 5), Shayan Jahangir (3 off 9), and Nicholas Pooran (4 off 6) had all fallen cheaply by the sixth over. Skipper Kieron Pollard (4 off 9) and Rashid Khan (7 off 6) followed soon after, leaving MI New York struggling at 56/7 by the ninth over. Romario Shepherd and Trent Boult showed some fight, adding 33 runs off 16 balls. However, Shepherd, New York's last hope, was dismissed in the 11th over after scoring 25 off 14 balls. Maxwell wrapped things up for Washington in the 14th over, taking two wickets, including Boult (16 off 13) and Ehsan Adil (0 off 2), bowling out MI New York for just 88.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, Washington got off to a solid start, courtesy of their openers Steve Smith and Travis Head. However, Smith was dismissed by Rashid Khan in the fifth over, scoring 8 off 10. Head then took charge, forming a solid partnership with Andries Gous. Their timely boundaries and steady play helped Washington cross the 100-run mark in the 11th over. Head's blistering knock ended in the 12th over when he was caught by Rashid Khan off Romario Shepherd, having scored 54 off 33 balls. Glen Maxwell soon followed, despite being given a lifeline in the 15th over when Taylor dropped him at mid-off. Rashid Khan eventually dismissed him in the 16th over, with Maxwell managing to score 15 off 14 balls. After 16 overs, Washington stood at 133/3, with Gous still anchoring the innings.\n\nWashington finished their innings strongly, adding 49 runs in the last four overs, thanks to the free-flowing strokes of Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra. Gous reached his half-century in the 19th over, while Ravindra smashed two sixes and a four off Boult, producing 23 runs in the same over. Ravindra was dismissed by Kieron Pollard in the final over after a quickfire 31 off 14 balls. Gous was caught on the last ball of the innings, having scored a crucial 59 off 48, helping Washington post a formidable total of 182/5. Brief Scores: Washington Freedom (Andries Gous 59 off 48, Travis Head 54 off 33, Kieron Pollard 2/14 in 2 overs) beat MI New York (Romario Shepherd 25 off 14, Trent Boult 16 off 13, Jasdeep Singh 3/14 in 3 overs) by 94 runs.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)",

Skipper Steve Smith departed after scoring just 8 runs. No. 3 Andries Gous and opener Travis Head stitched together a crucial partnership of 73 runs, laying the foundation for a big total.\n\nGous, known for his aggressive strokeplay, smashed 59 runs off just 48 balls, peppering the Grand Prairie night with 4 sixes and 3 fours. Head, the ever-reliable left-hander, played a composed innings, scoring 54 runs off 33 balls, including 9 fours and two sixes.\n\nThe middle order continued the momentum. Glenn Maxwell, though dismissed cheaply for 15, provided a quickfire cameo with a towering six. The young gun Rachin Ravindra impressed with a whirlwind knock of 31 runs off just 14 deliveries, finding the boundary twice on the on-side and twice over the ropes. The Washington batting order displayed remarkable depth, with even lower-order batters contributing valuable runs to propel the team to a formidable total of 182/5 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nMI New York falters in face of bowling blitz\n\nChasing a stiff target of 183, MI New York’s hopes for victory evaporated quickly. Both openers, Steven Taylor and Shayan Jahangir, fell cheaply, leaving the middle order with a mountain to climb. None of the remaining batters could manage to build a significant partnership, succumbing to the pressure applied by the Freedom bowlers.\n\nJasdeep Singh was the wrecker-in-chief for Washington, picking up 3 crucial wickets for just 14 runs in his 3 overs. The right-arm medium pacer displayed exceptional control and swing, exposing the vulnerabilities in the New York batting line-up. Lockie Ferguson and Marco Jansen provided excellent support, claiming 2 wickets apiece. The Washington bowling attack, with a mix of pace and spin, never allowed the New York batters to settle, restricting them to a paltry 88 runs in just 13.3 overs.\n\nAlso WATCH: Imad Wasim’s stunning one-handed catch dismisses Mukhtar Ahmed during SEO vs WAF in MLC 2024\n\nDominant Washington Freedom qualifies for the playoffs\n\nThis emphatic victory consolidates Freedom’s position at the top of the MLC 2024 points table. Their clinical performance with both bat and ball leaves a strong message for the rest of the competition. Washington Freedom are now the first team to reach the playoffs of the second season.

He was also the stand-out bowler in our opening game against MI NY this season with a spell of 3/24 in four overs.\n\nTravis Head scored his first half-century in MLC in our last game with an entertaining 32-ball 54. He showcased his wide array of shots and aggressive intent smashing six sixes and two fours during his knock.\n\nSteve Smith was instrumental in our previous win against MI NY remaining unbeaten on 46 of just 28 balls.

    "date": "Tue Jul 16 12:26:42 2024",
    "body": "In the United States, there have always been four primary sports that ruled over all others — football, baseball (obviously), basketball, and hockey. That said, another new competition is just beginning to flex its muscles and gain respect from fans across the country — Major League Cricket (MLC). MLC T20 cricket league launched in 2022 to bring Cricket on similar lines to major sports leagues in the USA.\n\nMeaning of MLC for Cricket in the United States\n\nCricket is no new entrant to the U.S. sporting landscape; it is undoubtedly a niche sport upheld as an elitist and unattainable spectator sport compared to the other major leagues. However, the rise of MLC may well see that story shift. The league has started to promote Cricket at a scientific level, hack new audiences, and enrich the local role of American Cricket on the professional stage.\n\nMLC plans to tap into a broad audience and introduce Cricket in a traditional form by setting up franchise-based teams across important metropolitan centers. The league’s efforts to groom home-grown talent and the arrival of some international stars are likely to help increase young American cricketers decide they want to be part of their nation side, creating new fanbases for the sport around America.\n\nPartnership with Global Environment: Major League Cricket\n\nBeyond the U.S., MLC has more significant ideas. The General Manager of the league has already announced strategic partnerships with established cricket boards and leagues around the globe, including Cricket West Indies, Cricket Australia, and Emirates Cricket Board. These international connections have allowed MLC to bring on the best global players and coaches, as well as technical expertise in new Netball tactics, raising the standard of play.\n\nDepending on how successful MLC is, the impact on the wider game could be huge for Cricket worldwide. While the league has long been a hit in South Africa, its growing appeal stateside could make it a blueprint for Cricket to establish itself in other non-traditional markets and broaden its global reach.\n\nAlso Read: Major League Cricket (MLC): Showcasing the Rise of Cricketing Titans with Grandest Stage\n\nChallenges and Opportunities of MLC\n\nWhile MLC enters with some encouraging noise, several headwinds ensure the league has its work cut out for it in trying to stay stateside long-term. This will involve massive infrastructure spending, from building world-class cricket stadiums to practice facilities and creating audiences around the game.\n\nThe league also has to lure in American sports fans who are used to a quicker pace and higher scores than the kind dished out by so much soccer. The content and depth of the story created by this will ultimately determine MLC’s success, in conjunction with good marketing efforts to commercialize it.\n\nImpact on the USA Economy of Major League Cricket\n\nThe birth of Major League Cricket represents a historic moment for the game of cricket in America and can have an enormous economic impact!!! The league is expected to have a significant economic impact on America as it continues to grow and makes its mark in North America.\n\nThe future operation of these facilities is expected to provide an economic boost in the long run, while their construction will create work in the short term. Furthermore, better availability of quality cricket infrastructure can aid the genesis and flourishing of the sport at grassroots levels by enhancing financial paybacks.\n\nMajor League Cricket has the capacity to transfer this wealth into the American economy by leveraging professional cricket and may transform itself into a national economic powerhouse, creating jobs, revenue generation, and ancillary industry development. As the league develops further and more rapidly, its economic influence is expected to be a key determinant of both sustainability in the long run and success everywhere else.\n\nConclusion\n\nMajor League Cricket will become a turning point in the global proliferation of Cricket; wait. By launching a new professional league here, MLC seeks to change the dynamic of how Cricket is played in this country and lead American cricketers by example while capturing the attention and imagination — and wallets — of sports fans throughout the USA. As the league keeps evolving and expanding, its contribution to future Cricket will be watched by everyone in their homes worldwide.",

MI New York scored 154-9 with US international Saurabh Netravalkar taking 3-24 off his four overs before Steve Smith’s unbeaten 46 from 28 balls saw Freedom home by a slender margin before the rain came.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLWW\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: EXPERIENCED IN ABUNDANCE\n\nThe Texas Super Kings, built with the help of so-called ‘Dad’s Army’ Indian Premier League franchise Chennai Super Kings, began their season with a 12-run loss to last season’s wooden spoon outfit Los Angeles Knight Riders in Dallas with Devon Conway’s 53 runs from 39 deliveries not enough to see TSK reach the target of 163.\n\nLAST THREE: LLLWL\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Washington Freedom have a squad heavily influenced by Australians with aforementioned captain Steve Smith leading the likes of Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell among others. Head missed out with just one run from seven balls against MI New York but that is not expected to be a common occurrence for their Test number five and Head to top score for Freedom is always a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, they have a well-rounded attack, too, with plenty of spin options but also the pace of Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar. Ferguson took 1-28 the other day and his bowling has been difficult to hit for a while now, famously taking 3-0 from four overs for New Zealand against Papua New Guinea last month, so Ferguson to be Freedom’s best bowler in this one would be a good shout.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nAs mentioned, there is experience throughout the TSK side but the downside to that is there is perhaps not bundles of energy and that was shown in their fairly slow chase the other day. If they are to up the tempo then a lot will rest on the shoulders of Aaron Hardie and Marcus Stoinis. Stoinis didn’t have the best of starts with two from six but if he gets going he is a formidable hitter and Stoinis to hit two or more sixes in any innings, especially one where he needs to respond, would be a reasonable expectation.\n\nIn the bowling department, the Super Kings lack a bit of quality experience with Zia-ul-Haq their best bowler from the other day, taking 2-16. Spin is likely to be their biggest threat against the likes of Head and Smith, and even Maxwell, though, so Mohammad Mohsin, despite going wicket-less the other day, would be tipped to take two or more wickets here.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS TEXAS SUPER KINGS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThere are quite a few issues in the Texas Super Kings side and there is probably too much reliance on the opening pair of Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway to score their runs. That means they will likely take their time to get set and TSK having the better opening stand, or at least the biggest with the pace of Head’s innings likely to be a major factor in the game, would be a good bet but Washington Freedom, albeit not overly convincing against MI New York the other day, would still be viewed as favourites for the match.",

Opener Jason Roy contributed a brisk 26 off 18 balls before being bowled by Plunkett. Despite small contributions from Sunil Narine (6), Nitish Kumar (20), and David Miller (24), the team struggled to maintain momentum.\n\nShakib Al Hasan stood out with a solid 35 off 26 balls, but it was Andre Russell's explosive unbeaten 40 off 25 balls that provided a late surge, helping LAKR to a total of 165 for 6 in their 20 overs.\n\nThe Unicorns' bowling attack was led by Brody Couch and Haris Rauf, both claiming two wickets each. Couch finished with impressive figures of 2 for 24, while Rauf took 2 for 38. Their disciplined bowling ensured that LAKR's batsmen could never fully capitalize on their starts.\n\nIn response, the Unicorns got off to a shaky start, losing Jake Fraser-McGurk early for 9 runs. However, New Zealand opener Finn Allen and Matthew Short took control of the chase.\n\nAllen's aggressive 63 off 37 balls and Short's blistering 58 off 26 balls formed a match-winning partnership of 116 runs for the second wicket. Their combined assault left the LAKR bowlers struggling, particularly targeting Spencer Johnson, who despite taking three wickets, conceded 36 runs in his four overs.\n\nVeteran spinner Sunil Narine managed to take a wicket, finishing with 1 for 39, but the rest of the LAKR bowlers failed to make significant inroads. The Unicorns achieved the target comfortably, reaching 166 for 4 in just 15.2 overs, sealing a comprehensive victory.\n\nWith this dominant performance, the San Francisco Unicorns have set a high standard for their season ahead.

However, Finn Allen looked eager to make a quick meal of the target.

While Finn Allen became Spencer Johnson’s second wicket of the night in the 13th over, Josh Inglis (15), Corey Anderson (11), and Hassan Khan (2) helped the Unicorns reach their target in 15.2 overs.\n\nSpencer Johnson was the leading wicket-taker for the LA Knight Riders with figures of 3/36.\n\nEarlier, San Francisco Unicorns bowlers did well to restrict the LA Knight Riders.

In their opening game of the second edition of the Major League Cricket, Saurabh Netravalkar and Justin Dill picked up three wickets each, while Glenn Maxwell and Lockie Ferguson have done a decent job. With the bat, skipper Steven Smith led by example.\n\nWhen it comes to Texas, they lost to Los Angeles Knight Riders in their opening game. Devon Conway looked sensational, as the New Zealand international hit a half-century, but the other batters struggled with the bat. Among bowlers, Zia-ul-Haq, Aaron Hardie and Marcus Stoinis picked up two wickets each, but there’s a lot of room for improvement.\n\nMatch Details\n\nPitch Report\n\nScoring runs hasn’t been easy in Morrisville. However, if a batter spends enough time in the middle, one can make a difference.

However, on his first match in the MLC 2024, the 33-year-old looked in good touch, scoring 53 runs off 39 balls. After losing the first match, Texas are under pressure and Conway would hope to help the franchise win their first match in the season.\n\nAlso Check: MLC 2024 Most Runs\n\nProbable Best Bowler: Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nUSA’s Saurabh Netravalkar had a remarkable time in the T20 World Cup. He was a key component in USA’s success and the pacer has continued with a similar momentum for Washington in the ongoing MLC. If he continues in the same rhythm, Washington can very well challenge for the title.\n\nToday’s Match Prediction: Washington Freedom to win the match\n\nScenario 1\n\nWashington Freedom win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 35-45\n\nTEX: 145-165\n\nWashington Freedom win the match\n\nScenario 2\n\nTexas Super Kings win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 35-45\n\nWAS: 155-175\n\nWashington Freedom win the match",

His spell of 6/9 against the San Francisco Unicorns left the opposition batsmen bewildered, paving the way for the MOM award after a 30-run win for his side. He picked the wickets of Matthew Wade, Marcus Stoinis, Shadab Khan, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf and Chaitanya Bishnoi.\n\nThe ongoing 2024 MLC season promises to be even more exciting, with established stars and emerging talents vying for bowling supremacy. We can expect more diverse bowling attacks with fresh talent pumped into the MLC 2024 squads, a greater pressure to perform at the highest stage, and much more.

    "body": "DALLAS: In a nail-biting encounter at the Grand Prairie Stadium, the San Francisco Unicorns edged out the Texas Super Kings by 10 runs in the semifinal match of the 2024 Major League Cricket season to seal berth in final.\n\nThe San Franciso Unicorns posted a challenging total of 200/6, thanks to a vital innings from Finn Allen (101) that set the stage for a thrilling chase where the Texas Super Kings fell just short at 190/4. Following the day’s result, the Texas Super Kings will take on the Washington Freedom on Sunday.\n\nFinn Allen's explosive 101 off 53, including nine boundaries and five sixes, set the tone for the Unicorns. Allen's aggressive play during the powerplay provided the Unicorns with the momentum they needed, bringing them to a powerplay score of 66/0. Despite Noor Ahmed’s quick wickets of Jake Fraser ‘McGurk (18) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (0), Josh Inglis added a crucial 37 from 25 deliveries to support Allen through the innings. Fin Allen’s exploits included a 16 run over of Marcus Stoinis on two occasions, the second and the 13th over, and an 18 run over of Zia Ul Haq, comprising two consecutive sixes.\n\nHassan Khan’s quick 27 off 15 balls, was also vital in propelling the Unicorns to the 200-run mark. For the Texas Super Kings, Noor Ahmad was the standout bowler, capturing key wickets and finishing with figures of 3/27.\n\nIn response, the Texas Super Kings opened strong with Devon Conway (62*) leading the pursuit. Pushing the pace of the innings, Conway’s knock came in just 38 balls. The New Zealander struck four fours and two sixes in an innings where he did not see enough of the strike. Faf du Plessis contributed a brisk 45 off 22, but his dismissal derailed the Texas Super Kings’ momentum. While middle-order contributions from Aaron Hardie (19), Milind Kumar (2) and Marcus Stoinis (1) were lacking, Joshua Tromp, scored a breezy 56 from 36 balls, and kept the Super Kings in the hunt until the final over.\n\nConway brought up his half century in only 30 balls, whereas Tromp powered his way to the milestone in 31 deliveries, including four fours and two sixes.\n\nThe match came down to the wire in the last five overs with the Texas Super Kings needing 64 runs. With the dangerous Conway and Tromp at the crease, Haris Rauf and Pat Cummins held their nerves for the San Franciso Unicorns, delivering tight overs under pressure. Cummins was pivotal in the 20th over, conceding only 7 runs when 18 were needed, showcasing experienced death bowling that ensured a Unicorns' victory. Juanoy Drysdale emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the innings with figures of 2/33.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns 200/6 in 20 overs (Finn Allen 101, Josh Inglis 37, Noor Ahmad 3-27) beat Texas Super Kings 190/4 in 20 overs (Devon Conway 62 not out, Joshua Tromp 56 not out, Juanoy Drysdale 2-33) by 10 runs.",

However, opener Travis Head, was once again in a destructive mood as he brought up his fifth consecutive fifty in the tournament.

    "body": "Ricky Ponting is the coach of Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket 2024 ©MLC\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Cricbuzz, Ricky Ponting talks about his coaching philosophy, how to work with maverick talents like Glenn Maxwell, his stint with Delhi Capitals, and why he's gone from being a hard-nosed Australian captain to someone that is more widely appreciated. Excerpts:\n\nThis is your first stint in the franchise world outside of the IPL, if I'm not wrong. Why America as a coaching destination?\n\nWell, a lot of friends of mine and coaches and guys that I'm pretty close to played in MLC last year. And during the IPL, it was spoken about a little bit, last year even about potential for some growth here and how big the game already was in the US. Everyone I spoke to last year, had a really good time and enjoyed the tournament and felt that it will just get bigger and better. So I wanted to get involved early on to have a look at it.\n\nAnd I think all of us that are here now play a role in promoting the game. Even though I'm here coaching and looking after this team Washington Freedom, I think the fact that ex-international players are being involved in a tournament like this will hopefully help it grow.\n\nIs it also a means to carve out a legacy for the Freedom franchise by leading them in their nascent stages, and basically formulating that culture, identity, and the way they go about their cricket in a manner that is on course with your beliefs and other decision makers around you?\n\nYeah, absolutely. I think Cameron White and Shawn Bradstreet were here last year along with Michael Klinger. I think they'd set a pretty good culture. The team made the playoffs, but didn't go all the way. The plan going forward for us this year was to make sure we have sustained success and as you say, build the right culture for this franchise. I think I've been lucky to be around a lot of really successful teams as a player and as a coach, and got a pretty good grasp on cultural sort of matters. It's what makes me a good coach, and what I think makes people enjoy me being around them. So that's what I continue to work on every day. Talking to a lot of the guys here, there's a lot of them that haven't been around a lot of international experience like I've been able to bring here. So that makes it more enjoyable for me to work in that sort of environment.\n\nThere are about 15 Aussies in the MLC. Most of them are your star Australian cricketers that were part of the World Cup squad. Now compare that to The Hundred where there are only four Australia cricketers. We know Aussie cricketers are a golden asset for any league, so is the cricketing world order changing right now in front of our eyes?\n\nI think the whole game is in quite an interesting phase right now with different tournaments almost popping up every year. A lot of those tournaments overlap. Even the BBL in Australia overlaps with ILT20 and also the SA20. It's good and bad for players, I guess. Players get a chance to play in lots of different competitions. But with the overlapping like we've seen with San Francisco Unicorns' Matthew Short leaving MLC early to go to play in The Hundred, that's one thing I'm not a big fan of. I don't like seeing players leave early to go and play in a different tournament, and I think it's something that needs to be addressed going forward. I think there need to be certain windows cut out for every tournament - make sure there's clean air for that tournament to get over and done with, and keep their players for the big games. I've been there before with the BBL, where you sign players up at the start and you make the finals and you lose your stars when the big games come around. That's not ideal for anybody.\n\nBut I think a lot of the players have probably had a similar attitude like me, that they wanted to have a look at MLC in the early days. Get involved early and hopefully be part of the growth. Even having someone like Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell here. As you say there are a lot of big name Australian players playing this year. And I think that's great for the tournament.\n\nWas there also the lure of leaving your imprints on a franchise and making a legacy for yourself?\n\nI don't look at it that way. I don't look at leaving legacy or imprints. I just want to get here and do the best job that I can and make sure that the players understand what I'm all about and how much I love working with good players and making them better. More importantly, understand how important winning is to me. That's the first thing I say to any group that I come to - that anything we do from here until the end of this tournament, we'll find ways to to get better and win. That attitude certainly seems to work so far this year.\n\nWith the type of personality you are, you're all in when you take up an assignment. It has come to my knowledge that you were heavily active on the team WhatsApp group, and tried to stay on top of what was going on in the practice sessions even while you were in the Caribbean. So what sort of involvement can we expect from you with Freedom in the future? Especially considering the task of bridging the gap between domestic talent and international talent.\n\nIt actually wasn't ideal for me this year as my first year with this team, considering the overlap with the World Cup. But when Michael Klinger rang me and asked me to think about the job, the first thing I said was, 'Look, I know I'm actually going to be in the Caribbean, and I'll be commentating in the World Cup final. So it's not gonna be perfect for you. It's not gonna be perfect for me.' But, I think our conversations first started maybe in about January when I was working in the BBL. Right back then when I decided to go ahead and do it, then I was the one that was reaching out to make sure we signed the right players as well. So, my involvement sort of stems back to getting Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, these guys to come and sign here and play with us.\n\nWhen I'm here, I'm obviously heavily involved. Even some of the players the last couple of days have come to me and said we can't believe how actively involved you are with throwing balls all day, every day and being out in the field and running drills and things like that. But that's my opportunity to make players better. So I don't ever want to miss a minute or a practice session where I'm not giving my best to make every player in the squad as good as they can be. That's just the way that I am. It's ingrained in me. I'm not going to sit back and waste any time around cricket. And that's one of the other things I say to the boys first off is I don't like lazy people. I don't like people with talent that don't try and get the most out of themselves. So if I can show that attitude as a retired player and almost impose on them the way that I want them to go about their cricket while I'm here then hopefully that only makes them better.\n\n'I've played 15 years of cricket with him [Justin Langer]. I actually didn't even look at him or shake his hand until the game or games were over. So that's just my competitive nature coming out' ©BCCI\n\nAs a captain, you had mentioned in your autobiography that you asked the team not to address Kevin Pietersen as 'KP', or for that matter not call any of the Englishmen by their nicknames during the 2006-07 home Ashes. You stated you were too chummy with them in the previous series and now wanted to impose yourselves on them. There was also another side to it where Justin Langer once revealed how you asked the team to be humble before the final English wicket fell in the Perth Test when you were about to clinch that series. Does franchise cricket allow for these intense mind games? Have you ever done something similar to that as a coach?\n\nYes and I'd love to give a bit of an example for that as well. One thing that I always struggled with the IPL, obviously, was that a lot of the Indian guys play in the national team together and you tend to get to the ground really early - about two hours before the game starts. And a lot of the players sort of catch up on the ground and put their arms around each other and give them a cuddle whenever they meet each other before the game starts, but I'd never do that. Justin Langer this year, for instance. I've played 15 years of cricket with him. I actually didn't even look at him or shake his hand until the game or games were over. So that's just my competitive nature coming out.\n\nIt probably doesn't change the outcome but I think it sets a pretty good idea to the opposition that I'm there to get my job done and to have my team win that game of cricket. I'll probably have been a little bit more relaxed here to be honest. I actually saw Shane Watson before our last game but the only reason we crossed paths was we were having team photos on the ground, otherwise I would have stayed away from him. Pravin Amre has been an assistant coach with me at Delhi for seven years. I didn't see him until after the game was over so that's just me, but everyone's different I guess.\n\nWhat Rishabh's been through last year is one that's probably the most emotional, with how close I was with him and what he went through and the fear of all of us that he might not play cricket again. Seeing him back and doing what he's doing and leading DC, I think it's a pretty emotional time for everyone.\n\n***\n\nSix IPL seasons with DC is quite a long time. How have you evolved as a coach over the years at DC?\n\nI actually think even though I'm quite intense, I'm a bit more relaxed as a coach now than I once was. I'm better at understanding an individual's own preparation better than I probably once was. Coming reasonably new out of the game and straight into coaching, it was easy for me to sit back and expect everyone to train the same way that I did. But that doesn't necessarily bring the best out in people.\n\nSo even in this tournament, yes we've played well, but I think we've probably only had one or two compulsory training sessions on the way. The rest of them have been optional. I've left it up to the players. I've told them that I've got full trust in them to understand what they need, as far as their preparation is concerned, if they don't come to train, that's fine. But if they come to training, make sure they come with a real intent and purpose to get something out of it and try and improve. So I think that's probably the biggest thing. I try to learn more about people quicker and understand who they are as people more so than cricketers. I think if I do that I gain respect back pretty quickly and then hopefully they'll perform for you.\n\nYou mentioned the way you adapted to allow individuals the liberty to prepare as per their individual preferences. Would you want to add to this list where you would have learned something new which quashed or sort of negated some of your beliefs regarding your own coaching philosophy?\n\nI'm still learning every day. And if I'm not then I'm probably wasting my time because you get so many people around you that you can learn from. Little things I've tried to do in this tournament is that this group has played a lot of golf together since we've been here. And one thing I've tried to do is make sure that I'm playing in the groups with the local boys for five hours a day, rather than playing with Maxwell, Smith and Head, all the guys I know. I'm wasting five hours if I do that when I can be playing with Gous and Obus and Justin Dill and these guys. That's a perfect opportunity for me to learn more about them and spend time with them and have them understand that I actually chose to play with you guys this day over playing with the Aussie guys. So I've just tried to maximise my time with them here but also make sure that I've given them their own space. I think that's another important thing for me as a coach now is you gotta understand that you are a coach, you're not one of the players.\n\nIn an interview with Cricbuzz three years back, you had mentioned how you were a relationship-based coach. Over the course of six years you might have built some strong interpersonal relationships at DC. Can you recall having some moving moments with some of the individuals at DC that will kind of stay with you for the longest time?\n\nI haven't spoken publicly about not being there next year. I sort of let it go because I was here and been paying pretty close attention to what I'm doing here. Look, I had a great time there. DC, for me, was like my second home and my family was there with me for a month or five weeks in the last three or four years. It hasn't always been the most successful franchise. So we tried to build a real family inclusive environment where everyone was treated the same and everyone was on the same page.\n\nI mean what Rishabh's been through last year is one that's probably the most emotional, with how close I was with him and what he went through and the fear of all of us that he might not play cricket again. Seeing him back and doing what he's doing and leading DC, I think it's a pretty emotional time for everyone.\n\nSo it is what it is, we've decided to part ways and we decided to move on but that doesn't mean that I won't be coaching again. I'm very keen to get back involved in the IPL. There might be a few opportunities coming up and we'll see what happens over the next few weeks.\n\nYou have been fabulous at nurturing young talent during your time as the Australian captain as well as a coach in the IPL. Speaking to some of the domestics at Washington Freedom, they haven't been short of singing your praises on the experience they had with you. What is the first quality you want to see in a young player?\n\nIt depends where you are in a scouting role, or a coaching role. You want to see skill and talent first. But my coaching mantra is based around four words. That's attitude, effort, commitment, and care. I think as a coach, it's much easier to coach skill than it is to try and change someone's attitude, or character. So, give me the right attitude and the right effort, and the right commitment, then I feel that I can make those players better, but you give me the highest skill players that don't want to change, then they're wasting everyone's time.\n\nEven in a tournament like this, where there's been a lot of players that I've seen, I sit back and say, 'Well, that kid's good, he's got some real talent.' A lot of those are the ones that we've got here, which has made working here that bit more fun. I've obviously had a lot of players on the other end of the scale. Even at DC there's a lot of players that I've coached there that are highly talented players that I haven't been able to change. It's disappointing for me and it's also disappointing for the player not to be able to understand and see how much better they can become if they really want to.\n\nPiggybacking on what you've said there is also this curious case of supremely talented Prithvi Shaw that went from the most promising to being benched in the final season at DC. How does the coach's role become important in that situation where you have to handle people with truckloads of talent who are sort of outliers?\n\nI mean to start with I don't like talking about individual players, but Prithvi shouldn't be an outlier. He should be someone that's in every team; the first pick in most teams with the skill that he's got. He's had a chance to represent India as a youngster, making a hundred on his Test debut. And as you say, halfway through this year, we couldn't find a slot for him in our DC team. So that's disappointing for me as a coach not to be able to make certain players better and get the best out of them. But sometimes there's only so much you can give and so many times you can try. When you feel like you're not making players better and they're not doing what you need for the team, then you've got to look for other players that can do it for you.\n\nSo that then comes back to the player. With him in particular I've had a lot of chats with him, a lot of conversations to try and make him a better cricketer. I mean, he's still a young man. And he's still a very talented young player. And hopefully one day the penny really drops for him and he works out what he needs to do to be the best cricketer that he can be.\n\nTravis Head, Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell are part of the Washington Freedom setup ©Getty\n\nMarcus Stoinis mentioned not too long back that Maxwell, one of your Freedom stars, is the most talented batter he has ever seen till date. An Australian media outlet reported about his Test comeback on the tour of Sri Lanka. It is this outrageous talent of his that has had Cricket Australia toying with the idea of having him back in the Test scheme of things time and again. Obviously, we all know the range of strokes that he has. That makes him extra special. But coming from your X-ray eyes, if you can dissect Maxwell the batsman, his mind and the superhuman talent that he possesses.\n\nI think Glenn's name quite often gets thrown up when it's a subcontinent tour because of what he can do with bat and ball. He gives the Australian team a lot of flexibility as far as a second spin bowling option or even sometimes a third spin bowling if they go that way. I've known Glenn for a long time, and hopefully he gets the chance to play Test cricket again. But he's really made his name for himself in white ball cricket. He's had some outrageously good moments throughout his career.\n\nGuys like that who have that X factor talent about them, I don't like to talk to them too much about their cricket. You just have to be really careful with the way that you phrase things in the way that you speak to them. Because for players that have got that sort of talent, you don't want to get in their way. You don't want to have something that you said in the back of their mind that can actually stop that X factor play coming out. So for me, it's much easier to coach the guys that have less talent and less skill because I think I can help them and give them things that they can think about that can make them better.\n\nAnd Travis is exactly the same right now. I mentioned in one of our postgame chats the other night that there's a lot of things that I could talk to Travis about with his batting but I'm not going to because it's all good. It's going so well that I don't need to get in the back of his head. I don't want to be this little voice sitting on his shoulder. I want him to play with freedom and keep doing what he's doing and Maxwell was a bit the same. So it's hard to dissect. Now that AB de Villiers and those guys aren't around, Glenn and Suryakumar are probably the most complete 360-degree players in the modern game. And with what he can bring with the other dimensions to his cricket - his fielding and with the ball - he's obviously a very, very good player.\n\nDo you think people like Glenn Maxwell are a prototype of a T20 batter 10 years from now?\n\nGlenn probably almost had some of this flamboyance coached out of him when he was young. He got out a lot playing the reverse sweep and the switch hit when he was younger. Had coaches left, right and centre and commentators and media, and probably even me being one in certain times were questioning why he was trying to do that. But if he hadn't worked on it then and he hadn't got so good at playing it, then we wouldn't see the Glenn Maxwell of now. So he's shown a lot of courage to continue to play the way that he wants to play. For 10 or 12 years now he's reaped the rewards whether that's on-field performance or certainly the money he's made from the game has been on the back of the skill set that he's had.\n\nSince we have touched the future and you are one of the most prominent voices in the game, where do you see the international cricket calendar heading towards? How does one maintain the sanctity of Test cricket? And also be mindful that franchise cricket is the real cash cow now for the international players living outside of India. There is an argument to play only Test cricket as bilaterals and the white ball cricket only in ICC tournaments. What's your opinion on that?\n\nI don't want to see any international cricket played less. I just think it's something that's been sort of happening even when I was playing. Probably when the IPL started up was when this sort of stuff started to happen. Conversations were around about franchise cricket compared to international cricket. It's got to the point now where franchise cricket is probably the most talked about and certainly the most played because there are so many leagues around the world that have been allowed to start up, and international cricket is trying to slot in around these tournaments now, which is the opposite way that it used to be.\n\nSo there's some great challenges there but I would hate to see one day cricket, for instance, only played during World Cup years. I think there's a time and a place for all three formats. Where the game gets in trouble is when we start comparing one format to the other and immediately playing a Test match on the back of a 50-over or T20 World Cup. A great example is the last T20 World Cup that was in Australia that England won, they stayed on in Australia after that to play some one-dayers against Australia and I took my son to the MCG with his U-11 team to watch a contest between Australia and England. There were something like 8000 people there. When I was playing Australia vs England at the MCG, it was 80,000 plus every game. So that's the scheduling, and that's the unfortunate thing about it. There's still as many people watching the game as ever, they're just choosing what they want to watch and when they want to watch it.\n\nIf you've just had an international Test series, don't expect the attendance to be strong for the ODI series against Sri Lanka in the West Indies immediately after it for they'll be watching it at home. So that's the one thing we have to understand. But look, I'm not sure where it's headed. Well I know where it's headed. Obviously more and more franchise-based cricket where I think we're going to see in a lot of countries like New Zealand, like the West Indies have been doing for a long time and maybe Sri Lanka, these sorts of countries that don't get paid a lot to play international cricket then they're going to be choosing franchise cricket over international stuff which is a little bit sad, but that's the reality of the world right now.\n\nFor the most part in your playing days, you were someone who non-Australian fans hated to love because of your skill, how unabashedly pro-team or pro-teammates you were, which obviously the fans from the rest of the world were not fond of. Now after retirement that is exactly the quality the fans from MI, which you coached once, DC or Freedom now love about you. You won a lot of trophies as a player, but seem to be winning more hearts as a coach. Did you expect this turn around?\n\nI don't know if I expected it, or I didn't really care too much to be honest. When I was playing, I mean everything you said there was right. All I cared about was the guys on my team and making sure I was doing the right thing by them as people and players and getting results for them. When I was the captain of the Australian cricket team, I looked at myself as a protector, my job was to protect my teammates and look after them. I was a senior player and had lots of younger players coming in. The cold, hard facts of it is that international cricket can be a tough, lonely place. Some young players need older people like me around to look after them and protect them.\n\nThe way I describe it is when I was playing, I had a helmet on, I didn't say anything, didn't give anything away. But now that I've retired and taken my helmet off, I can actually start to show the world and people that maybe that wasn't me as a person. That was me trying to do my job as an Australian cricket captain. I want people to enjoy the time that they have when I'm around them, basically. If that means that I protect them or look after them or make them better, then at the end of the day that's what my job is.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet",

The winner of this one will book their place in the final.\n\nWashington Freedom has been in scintillating form in this competition. With five wins and one loss in seven games, they finished on top of the league table with 11 points. Their superb net run rate shows how dominant this team has been throughout the tournament. With openers Travis Head and Steve Smith in the top three run-scorers and Saurabh Netravalkar the top wicket-taker this season, they will have an eye on the trophy.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have been equally good.

These two teams have been the best two sides in this tournament. And while San Francisco won this match-up just days ago, that was a very close game.\n\nIt has to be said that Washington has won their games in a more dominating fashion this season, which might make them slight favourites in this one.

    "date": "Fri Jul 26 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Washington Freedom convincingly beat the San Francisco Unicorns to book their place in this year’s Major League Cricket final with the elimination of MI New York in the first playoff against Texas, where the competition will crown a new winner this year. And given their stellar run in the season, where they finished on top, it seems the team representing the capital is the team to beat.\n\nIt was a dominant show all around by the Washington Freedom. Having restricted the Unicorns to 145 in 19 overs, the Washington Freedom wasted little time in chasing down the score. With destroyer-in-chief, Travis Head led the way with a dominant 77 off 44 inclusive of three sixes and ten fours. When chasing the Washington Freedom, despite losing wickets cheaply, they maintained their rhythm to cruise to a seven-wicket win.\n\nWashington Freedom Bowlers Bowl Out the Unicorns\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIn a closely fought season between the two top sides, it was interesting to see who would come out on top. The team winning the toss seems to have the advantage for the most part, and when the Freedom captain Steve Smith won the toss he elected to bowl first. And having done so his decision was backed up well as his bowlers came to the party. A major concern for the Unicorns has been the inconsistency at the top of the order. The rising star player Jake Fraser-McGurk produced another failure managing just 11 off 11 deliveries.\n\nWhat followed was a tame batting performance by the side from San Francisco as none of the top-order players made an impact. The saving grace came in the form of Hassan Khan who scored 57 off 36 and a resistant 26 off 19 by Corey Anderson. Given the lack of big scores from top-order batsmen, the Unicorns struggle to a 145 before being bowled out in the 19th over.\n\nDominant Travis Head Leads the Washington Charge\n\nTravis Head is in the form of his life. His remarkable innings in the 2023 World Cup final have set him on a cracking path of batting dominance. Opening the innings Travis Head played an unbeaten 77 off 44 delivers inclusive of 13 boundaries in total. When chasing a modest target like 145, this sort of inning knocked the wind out of the Unicorns’ sails.\n\nThe side from San Francisco despite knocking over a few Washington top-order batsmen, were unable to keep a lid on the scoring and when fellow Australia international Glen Maxwell joined the fray, the game quickly got away from the defending side. Maxwell scored a rapid 56 off 23 with five sixes: a strike rate of 234+. This was the last nail in the coffin as the Washington Freedom got home with over four overs to spare.\n\nWashington Freedom into Major League Cricket Final\n\nSo we now have a new finalist in the Major League Cricket tournament. The Washington Freedom as the most dominant side this year has booked a deserving spot in the final. The question is can they go one step further and clinch the trophy? They certainly have the team to do so, and all would wait for what becomes the final playoff game between the Texas Super Kings and the Unicorns, who have another shot at qualification.\n\nFor More Great Content",
    "summary": "* The Washington Freedom have qualified for the final of the Major League Cricket tournament after defeating the San Francisco Unicorns in the playoff.\n* The Freedom restricted the Unicorns to 145 in 19 overs and then chased down the score, winning by 7 wickets.\n* Travis Head was the star of the show, scoring 77 off 44 balls with 3 sixes and 10 fours, while Glen Maxwell also contributed with a rapid 56 off 23 balls.\n* The Freedom's dominant performance was set up by their bowlers, who bowled out the Unicorns for 145.\n* The Unicorns struggled with inconsistency at the top of their order, with rising star Jake Fraser-McGurk failing to make an impact.\n* The Washington Freedom finished top of the table in the regular season and are the team to beat in the final.\n* The other finalist will be determined by the playoff game between the Texas Super Kings and the San Francisco Unicorns.",

Glenn Maxwell also scored a quickfire fifty during the chase.\n\nMeanwhile, the Unicorns progressed to the final with a 10-run win over the Texas Super Kings in the Challenger on Friday.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar continues to top the bowling charts in MLC 2024 with 14 wickets from six matches at an average of 12.07 runs and an impressive strike rate of 9.57.\n\nTravis Head and captain Steve Smith continue their run in the top five overall run-getters list this year, at second and fifth place, respectively.

    "date": "Sat Jul 27 18:13:00 2024",
    "body": "Washington Freedom qualified for the final of the Major League Cricket 2024 season by winning the Qualifier against the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas on Thursday. This puts us within touching distance of our maiden MLC title.\n\nThe captain-coach duo of Steve Smith and Ricky Ponting has developed a well-knit side that has been clinical and delivered some gritty performances. As we get ready to play our first final of MLC in just its second year, here is a glance at our consistent journey so far this season, highlighting the match results and key performers.\n\nGame 1 vs MI New York, Morrisville\n\nWe started our MLC 2024 campaign with a win over defending champions MI New York by four runs under the DLS method in a rain-shortened match in Morrisville. We reached 55/1 after restricting MINY to 154/9 before rain intervened and halted further play.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar and Justin Dill shone with the ball, picking up 3/24 and 3/33, respectively, as MINY were restricted to 154 due to the regular fall of wickets.\n\nMeanwhile, our skipper Steve Smith, got off to a memorable start both as a batter and as captain. Smith’s counter-attacking display, where he scored 22 runs in a single over, got us over the line, as we were ahead of the par score when play was stopped.\n\nGame 2 vs Texas Super Kings, Morrisville\n\nOur second game in Morrisville was also affected by rain, as our match against the Texas Super Kings was called off.\n\nAfter TSK reached a huge total of 203/5, we were on track as we raced to 62/0 in just four overs. Unfortunately, we needed to complete five overs for the DLS method to calculate the par score, so the match was abandoned.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nNetravalkar got two wickets, while both Travis Head and Steve Smith got to brisk starts in a game where we shared points with TSK.\n\nGame 3 vs Seattle Orcas, Dallas\n\nThis was our first full game in MLC 2024. We were put in a tough position in the second innings, chasing 125 against the Seattle Orcas in Dallas.\n\nReduced to 64/5, the team showed grit and resilience to come back and win the match by five wickets. This was undoubtedly the most important two points we earned in the league phase.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nLockie Ferguson’s four-fer and Netravalkar’s three-wicket haul was half the job done. But it was the unbeaten sixth partnership of 63 between Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar during the chase that changed the course of the game.\n\nGame 4 vs Los Angeles Knight Riders, Morrisville\n\nWith a hard-fought win in the last game, we rose from strength to strength in our next match. We beat Los Angeles Knight Riders by eight wickets, our highest margin of victory by wickets, in Morrisville in our fourth game to cement our position on top of the points table.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nNetravalkar was again the pick among bowlers with a spell of 4/35 as Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell picked up three and two wickets, respectively. LAKR were restricted to 129, while Travis Head got his first fifty to take us home with four overs to spare.\n\nGame 5 vs MI New York, Dallas\n\nThis was our second win against MINY in the 2024 edition of the MLC. The 94-run win in Dallas was our highest in terms of runs this season and also made us the first team to qualify for the playoffs of MLC this year.\n\nAfter scoring 182/5, our bowlers did an admirable job of restricting the opposition to just 88 runs as the game came to a close with 6.3 overs remaining.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nTravis Head warmed up for the crucial matches ahead by scoring his second fifty of the tournament, while homeboy Andries Gous also scored a half-century. Rachin Ravindra’s game-changing cameo was crucial for us as we posted a big score in the first innings.\n\nHowever, Jasdeep Singh’s MLC debut was the highlight of the night. He seized the opportunity with open hands, recording figures of 3/14. Jasdeep, the player of the match, was well supported by Marco Jansen, Ferguson, and Maxwell, who each picked up two wickets.\n\nGame 6 vs Texas Super Kings, Dallas\n\nBatting first against Texas Super Kings in Dallas, we notched up our highest score in the history of MLC, 206/5. The result was a 42-run win over TSK, who scored 164 in the second innings.\n\nThis win was important too, as it helped us continue our winning momentum from the start of the season and also gave us an advantage of a top-two finish in the points table.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nOpeners Head and Smith once again set the tone as Glenn Maxwell put his all-round skills on display with a 30-plus score with the bat and a three-wicket haul with the ball.\n\nJasdeep made an impact for the second straight match in a row picking three crucial wickets as Ravindra finished with an impressive haul of 4/16.\n\nGame 7 vs San Francisco Unicorns, Dallas\n\nWe got our first defeat this season in our last league match against San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. In a third match affected by rain, we fell short by six wickets under the DLS method.\n\nIt was an excellent batting display from SFU, headlined by Sanjay Krishnamurthi with an unbeaten 79, which made our first-innings tally look inadequate.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nThe Australian trio of Smith, Head and Andrew Tye did well for us, albeit in a losing cause, with the openers scoring fifties and Tye picking up three wickets.\n\nQualifier vs San Francisco Unicorns, Dallas\n\nWe came back well in the Qualifier match of MLC 2024 in Dallas, registering a win against SFU by seven wickets to progress to the final of the event.\n\nNotable Performances\n\nIt was a clinical show from our side, with both the batters and bowlers contributing in equal measure to our win. Ravindra recorded career-best figures with the ball, as Jansen and Netravalkar too contributed.\n\nHead and Maxwell were at their imperious best as the duo smashed eight sixes and 14 boundaries among them.",
    "summary": "The Washington Freedom have qualified for the final of the MLC 2024 season by winning the Qualifier against the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas.

The win came by seven wickets, the Freedom bowling out San Francisco for 145, before chasing that target down in just 15.3 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: WLW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: CAN SUPER KINGS SECURE A MUCH-CRAVED HOME FINAL\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns may have been put in their place by Washington in a qualifier, but showed huge guts and class to bounce back in the challenger, breaking the hearts of home team Texas Super Kings. The Unicorns made 200/6 in a high-scoring thriller, which they ultimately won by 10 runs, restricting Texas to 190/4.\n\nLAST THREE: WLW\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe two Washington Freedom openers being the second and third highest scoring batters in the tournament is testament to the strength of their top order. Travis Head’s 77 not out in the qualifier took his overall tally to 327, whilst opening partner Steve Smith boasts 248 runs of his own. The smart move would be placing a stake on both via the ‘Team - Top Batter’ and also backing the pair to each record over 30+ match runs.\n\nSo often a left-arm pacer can prove worth their weight in gold across the T20 format and Marco Jansen demonstrated that last time out, taking three wickets against San Francisco. Jansen’s height poses an additional threat in regards to generation extra bounce and making a play for the South African to pick up over 1.5 match wickets looks good value.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nOnce again, Finn Allen was the star for San Francisco Uniforms in the challenger having accumulated one of his best individual innings in T20 cricket. It was his 101 off 53 balls which ensured an eventual winning total for the Unicorns vs Texas. He will have a huge role to play in the final and on the back of such a brilliant score, is worth backing to accrue over 24.5 match runs here. His six-hitting abilities could also warrant investment, specifically via the ‘Batter Total Match Sixes’ market.\n\nOn the bowling front, Hassan Khan has taken three wickets across the play-offs so far and his left-arm orthodox slow bowling has been tricky to deal with from an opposition point of view. You’d expect Hassan to bowl his four-over allocation in the final and a stake on him to pick up 2+ wickets via the ‘Bowler Milestones’ market is worth serious consideration.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERTPREDICTION\n\nThe last time these two teams met, Washington Freedom demonstrated their class in all departments. Outplaying San Francisco with bat and ball, the Freedom have shown why they’ve set the standard throughout this year’s edition of Major League Cricket. Having a world class top order that combines control with aggression has been key to their success, whilst all avenues are well-covered within the bowling department.\n\nPlenty depends on Finn Allen from a San Francisco point of view, but if he was to fail then you would worry about the Unicorns’ depth, particularly if Washington was to take a cluster of early wickets. With just one defeat across the tournament so far, in a game that had precious little at stake from their point of view, Washington Freedom have been outstanding and the expectation is that they will take that final step and emerge triumphant in the second year of Major League Cricket.",
    "summary": "**Final Match Details**\n\n* Date and Time: Sunday, July 28, 2024, 8:30 pm ET (USA) / Monday, July 29, 2024, 1:30 am (UK)\n* Venue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, Texas, United States\n* Weather: Extremely hot conditions with temperatures around 30°C\n* Teams: Washington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns\n\n**Team Forms**\n\n* Washington Freedom: Won 6 out of 8 games, including the qualifier against San Francisco Unicorns.

The Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) beat San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs.\n\nTOURNAMENT AWARDS:\n\nWINNERS: Washington Freedom\n\nRUNNERS-UP: San Francisco Unicorns\n\nSTAKE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Travis Head (Washington Freedom)\n\nROYAL RICE LEADING RUN SCORER: Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings)\n\nWILLOW BY CRICBUZZ LEADING WICKET TAKER: Saurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom)\n\nBART KING DOMESTIC PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Hassan Khan (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nMatch Stats\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets: 1-11 (Travis Head - 1.2 ov), 2-49 (Andries Gous - 5.5 ov), 3-86 (Rachin Ravindra - 10.1 ov), 4-169 (Steven Smith - 16.3 ov), 5-177 (Glenn Maxwell - 17.2 ov)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Fall of wickets: 1-15 (Jake Fraser McGurk - 2.1 ov), 2-30 (Sanjay Krishnamurthi - 3.5 ov), 3-30 (Finn Allen - 4.5 ov), 4-51 (Sherfane Rutherford - 7.4 ov), 5-53 (Josh Inglis - 8.1 ov), 6-53 (Corey Anderson - 8.3 ov), 7-68 (Pat Cummins - 9.5 ov), 8-78 (Hassan Khan - 10.4 ov), 9-92 (Haris Rauf - 13.5 ov), 10-111 (Juanoy Drysdale - 15.6 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XIs\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nTravis Head\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nIan Holland\n\nAndrew Tye\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen\n\nJake Fraser McGurk\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nJosh Inglis(WK)\n\nSherfane Rutherford\n\nHassan Khan\n\nCorey Anderson(C)\n\nPat Cummins\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nCarmi le Roux\n\nJuanoy Drysdale\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Monday, July 29, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas",

    "body": "The Washington Freedom, led by Steve Smith, have been crowned the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 champions after a decisive 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe skipper’s blistering 88 runs off just 52 balls propelled Washington Freedom to a commanding total of 207-5. The bowlers then went on the rampage, bowling out the opposition for a mere 111 runs.\n\nThe Unicorns skipper Corey Anderson elected to bowl first after winning the toss. This decision paid off early as Travis Head was dismissed cheaply, leaving the Freedom at a precarious 86-3 midway through the innings. In the second half of the innings, Smith and Glenn Maxwell batted relentlessly and tormented the Unicorns bowlers.\n\nA 22-ball 40-run blitz from Maxwell, along with quick-fire innings from Mukhtar Ahmed and Obus Pienaar, propelled the team past the 200-run mark.\n\nThe Washington side displayed clinical efficiency with both their bowling and batting. Meanwhile, the San Francisco Unicorns were overwhelmed by the demanding run rate from the start, losing their top order batsmen within the first five overs.\n\nThe left-arm pace of Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar proved devastating during the powerplay and mounted pressure on the Washington Freedom. Led by Anderson, the side struggled, losing wickets at regular intervals and limping to 68-7 by the halfway mark.\n\nCameos from Pat Cummins and Carmi le Roux propelled the team to a triple-digit total. However, the match’s outcome soon became inevitable. Rachin Ravindra sealed the victory by claiming his third wicket, dismissing Juanoy Drysdale with the final delivery of the 16th over.\n\nTexas Super Kings skipper Faf du Plessis of the finished the tournament as the top scorer, amassing 420 runs. Meanwhile, Washington Freedom pacer Saurabh Netravalkar was the tournament’s top wicket-taker, claiming 15 dismissals.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom’s (WF) dominant run in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 ended with a deserving win in the final, hammering San Francisco Unicorns (SFU) by a massive margin of 96 runs.\n\nAfter being asked to bat first, Travis Head and Steven Smith, who have been the best batters of MLC 2024 were not able to give a good start as the former was dismissed for nine in the second over. Captain Smith stood at one end and got great support from Andries Gous, Rachin and Glenn Maxwell, bringing their side into the game.\n\nMaxwell & Smith’s aggressive 83-run partnership between over 11-17 pushed Washington’s potential total from 180 to 200+. Maxwell’s 40 of 22 and final over fireworks from Mukhtar Ahmed and Obus Pienaar resulted in Washington Freedom posting a huge total of 207/5 at the end of 20 overs. Pat Cummins was the pick of the bowlers for San Francisco as he finished with 2/35, while Hassan Khan, Haris Rauf and Juanoy Drysdale picked up a wicket apiece.\n\nChasing 208, the San Francisco Unicorns lost their youthful top order in the first five overs as Marco Jansen sent back both openers in Jake Fraser-McGurk and Finn Allen early. The Washington bowlers gave no room for San Francisco batters to open their arms as they ran through their batting line-up, bowling them out for just 111 runs and clinching their first-ever MLC Title. Jansen and Rachin picked up three wickets each with Tye taking two and Maxwell and Netravalkar sharing one wicket each.\n\nWith complete domination in batting, bowling and fielding, Washington Freedom led by Smith and coached by Ricky Ponting won the second edition of Major League Cricket.\n\nFinal: Washington Freedom beat San Francisco Unicorns by 96 runs\n\nTop performers of MLC 2024\n\nHits of MLC 2024\n\nTravis Head (Washington Freedom)\n\nTravis Head had an outstanding MLC 2024. Making his debut in MLC, Head came in with a huge reputation for being a destructive opener after his heroics in IPL 2024 and ICC T20WC 2024. He lived up to the hype as the South Australian smashed 336 runs at a massive strike rate of 174. He smashed five consecutive fifties and outplayed the oppositions almost single handedly. Apart from winning the championship, he was awarded the “Player of the Tournament” award for his match-winning knocks.\n\nSteven Smith (Washington Freedom)\n\nSteven Smith redeemed himself in T20 cricket through a championship-winning season for Washington Freedom. He stepped up as both batter and captain as he led his team to the title, winning seven of the nine games. With the bat, he proved his mettle as an opener. He smashed 336 runs at an average of 56 with a strike rate of 149, smashing three fifties, with the most important one coming in the final.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom)\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar had an excellent season. He was the highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets in seven innings at an outstanding strike rate of 10.5. The experience of playing the big teams in ICC T20WC 2024 helped Netravalkar become an even better bowler in MLC 2024.\n\nRashid Khan (MI New York)\n\nRashid Khan was one of the few positives for the relatively below-par season for inaugural champions MI New York. He showcased his all-round capabilities as he picked up 10 wickets, maintaining a good economy of 6.2. He stepped up the bat, too, scoring 162 runs in seven innings with two fifties. His strike rate of 178 with the bat was the third-best for a batter in MLC 2024.\n\nMisses of MLC 2024\n\nSunil Narine (LA Knight Riders)\n\nSunil Narine had a horror season with both bat and ball. With the bat, he scored just 27 runs in six innings at an average of just 4.5, which is the lowest for a batter this season. He did not even reach a double-digit score in any of the six games. As a bowler, he managed just five wickets in six innings, even though he put the batters under pressure with an economy of 6.2. His failure with bat and ball impacted his captaincy as the LA Knight Riders failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nKieron Pollard (MI New York)\n\nKieron Pollard, too, was another captain who was a burden on his own team during MLC 2024. Leading MI New York, the big West Indian managed just 64 runs in seven innings. He averaged 12.6 and scored at a strike rate of 98, which was un-Pollard-like. He picked up five wickets in seven games as the occasional bowler. His overall performance did not live up to a captain’s standards.\n\nJake Fraser McGurk (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe Victorian sensation Jake Fraser McGurk had an MLC to forget as he was one of the least impactful players for the eventual runners-up, San Francisco Unicorns. In seven innings, he managed just 81 runs at an average of 11.6. He had a below-par strike rate of 126 and failed to cross even 20 runs in the seven innings.\n\nHaris Rauf (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nHaris Rauf had a quiet MLC 2024, as he managed just four wickets in nine games. His economy was also on the higher side as he gave away runs at 9.1 runs/over. His bowling strike rate of 48.5 was the worst for a bowler in MLC 2024. He went wicketless in six of the nine games.\n\nBreakout performers in MLC 2024\n\nHassan Khan (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe 25-year-old all-rounder Hassan Khan had a breakout performance in MLC 2024. Representing San Francisco Unicorns, the attacking batter came at the lower order (6-8) and smashed 204 runs at an average of 40.8 with a strike rate of 144. With the ball, the left-arm spinner picked up 10 wickets in seven innings with an economy of 7.1 and a strike rate of 13.2. He was a standout performer for his team as he was their highest wicket-taker and second-highest run-scorer over Matt Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Josh Inglis and others.\n\nUnique Statistical Milestones\n\nAustralian players to score five consecutive fifties in a T20 tournament\n\nDavid Warner - IPL 2019\n\nTravis Head - MLC 2024\n\nHighest win% for an Australian Captain in T20Is (50+ matches)\n\n64.1 - Ashton Turner\n\n63.3 - Steven Smith\n\n62.2 - Adam Voges\n\n61.3 - Moises Henriques\n\n61.1 - Daniel Christian",

He is currently the second leading run-scorer in the tournament with 327 runs in 8 matches and needs another 94 runs to finish at the pole position.\n\nTop Pick – All-Rounder\n\nGlenn Maxwell recorded his first half-century of the tournament in the Qualifier against Unicorns where he struck an unbeaten 54* from just 23 balls. Overall, he made 113 runs and picked up 9 wickets.\n\nTop Pick – Bowler\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar has the uncanny knack of picking wickets and tops the leading wicket-takers chart in the tournament with 14 scalps in 6 matches he played.\n\nTop Pick – Wicketkeeper\n\nJosh Inglis looks in decent touch, having scores of 37, 8, 45, and 24* in his last 4 innings. He is likely to bat at No.4 for Unicorns.\n\nX-Factor:\n\nRachin Ravindra bowled exceedingly well in the Qualifier against Unicorns, returning with the figures of 4 for 11 in only 2.4 overs he bowled. In 6 matches in the tournament, he scored 88 runs and picked up 9 wickets.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Suggested Teams for WAS vs SF, Major League Cricket 2024, Final?\n\n1.

It took them only 15.3 overs to chase the modest 145, thanks to merciless hitting from Australia duo Travis Head (77*) and Glenn Maxwell (54*). Special credits to the bowlers who bowled in tandem, especially spinners Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell who rallied through the middle overs where the latter picked up 4 wickets while Marco Jansen who took the new cherry, claimed 3 scalps despite going 11.5 runs an over. They are a strong batting side with Travis Head firing at the top and with Glenn Maxwell back in form, they are hard to beat. The support from the bowlers is exceptional with Saurabh Netravalkar claiming 14 wickets, the most in the tournament. Lockie Ferguson walked off the field after tweaking his hamstring during the Qualifier contest and it’s a concern for the management if he doesn’t recover on time for the finals.",

Smith's innings was a masterclass in controlled aggression, while Maxwell's explosive batting provided the necessary fireworks to propel the team to a formidable total.\n\nThe Unicorns, in response, were immediately put on the back foot. Jake Fraser-McGurk fell early, dismissed for just 3 runs in the third over. The situation worsened when Marco Jansen delivered a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen, who had been the hero in the qualifier with a century, for a mere 13 runs. With the scoreboard reading 30/3, the Unicorns found themselves in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued as Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) fell early, extinguishing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, who was brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, further tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then cleaned out the tail with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the ultimate match of the tournament, the team from Washington lost Head (9) early. Then, Steve Smith (88) took centre stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock. He found support in Andries Gous (21), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, finding the boundary with ease.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40) joined Smith and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as both Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith's departure, followed shortly by Maxwell's, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. The Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) beat San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs\n\nTOURNAMENT AWARDS:\n\nWINNERS: Washington Freedom\n\nRUNNERS-UP: San Francisco Unicorns\n\nSTAKE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Travis Head (Washington Freedom)\n\nROYAL RICE LEADING RUN SCORER: Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings)\n\nWILLOW BY CRICBUZZ LEADING WICKET TAKER: Saurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom)",

Really pleased for the boys. Some guys don't get a game but they are surely part of the squad, and we try to make them feel included. Everyone in this group has been outstanding. Everyone stood up at different times, our batting was pretty strong and Marco maybe didn't get to bat throughout the tournament. On the batting front, Travis was spectacular and he rightly won Player of the Tournament. With our bowling, I thought Netravalkar was outstanding and Lockie who missed today due to injury was outstanding as well. Everyone stood up for us.\"",

Smith and Australia team-mate Glenn Maxwell dominated with the bat then Unicorns' chase disintegrated with Marco Jansen claiming both openers among his three wickets.\n\nThe result cemented Freedom's standing as the team of the season having secured five wins in the group stage before progressing direct to the final with victory over Unicorns in the Qualifier. This contest turned their way through a stand of 83 off 39 balls between Smith and Maxwell as Freedom added 121 in the second half of their innings.\n\nSmith, who was overlooked for Australia's T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, overcame a sluggish start in the powerplay to make 88 off 52 balls including six sixes. Having been 10 off 12 balls in the sixth over he sped to a 34-ball fifty and ended the season as the joint second-leading run-scorer, alongside Travis Head, with 336 at a strike-rate of 148.67.\n\nHead, who has struck at over 170 during the tournament, fell early to Pat Cummins when he edged to slip, where Finn Allen held on at the second attempt, having been given a life in the opening over. But Andries Gous gave Freedom's innings impetus as Smith found his feet although when Haris Rauf removed Rachin Ravindra after the midway mark, it was an even contest at 86 for 3.\n\nThen Smith and Maxwell, the latter having found form in the closing stages of the tournament, took charge included 28 coming off the 13th over from Juanoy Drysdale. Smith produced an outrageous scoop for six off Rauf and was in sight of a century when he got a top edge off Cummins.\n\nIt appears likely that Smith's T20I career is over following his World Cup omission and absence from the squad to face Scotland and England in September as the selectors look to the future, but it has been a profitable few weeks for him in the US.\n\nThough Maxwell also fell in the next over, superbly caught by Josh Inglis, Freedom were still able to cross 200.\n\nUnicorns' chase never got off the ground. Jake Fraser-McGurk's low-key tournament ended when he edged into the stumps against Jansen to leave him with 81 runs at 11.57 then both Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Allen also fell inside the powerplay to leave a daunting task. Sherfane Rutherford was superbly caught at deep backward square by Ian Holland the ball after being dropped and the rest of the batting fell away amid a huge asking rate.\n\nFreedom's victory gave Ricky Ponting a title as coach a couple of weeks after leaving his role with Delhi Capitals.\n\nAndrew McGlashan is a deputy editor at ESPNcricinfo",
    "summary": "**Result:** Washington Freedom won the MLC 2024 title by defeating San Francisco Unicorns by 96 runs.\n\n**Score:** Washington Freedom scored 207 for 5, with Steven Smith scoring 88 off 52 balls and Glenn Maxwell scoring 40.

    "body": "Steve Smith's love affair with the United States deepened as the star batter reminded national selectors of his T20 prowess in a Major League Cricket final that had a distinctly Australian flavour.\n\nPat Cummins was immense for his San Fransisco Unicorns, whose ties to Silicon Valley and the world of venture capital lured the Test captain to the franchise, but was trumped by a jaw-dropping hand from Smith (88 off 52 balls) at Dallas' Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nThe decider of the MLC's second season was unmistakably American. A pre-game rendition of Star Spangled Banner played on electric guitar was followed by a drone light show as the 'half-time' entertainment.\n\nCommentators donned cowboy hats in keeping with the Texas venue that hosted the T20 World Cup opener last month, while sixes struck into the 7,000-strong crowd were measured in feet.\n\nBut the myriad Australians involved – eight of the 22 finalists, head coaches Ricky Ponting (Washington) and Shane Watson (San Fransisco), as well as the bulk of their assistants – left their mark on the competition's pinnacle match contested by the Cricket Victoria-aligned Unicorns and the Cricket NSW-aligned Freedom.\n\nWashington captain Smith, who owns an apartment in New York City, carted six sixes as he shared in a 83-run onslaught with Glenn Maxwell. Their union lasted 38 deliveries and essentially decided the match.\n\n\"He's been absolutely brilliant,\" Ponting said of Smith. \"He's pretty much singlehandedly won that game with the bat.\n\n\"I spoke to him before the game this morning and said, 'Look, if you play well, you show your class, you can win this game by yourself'. He's been awesome - his on-field leadership has been great.\"\n\nCummins (2-35 from four overs) had dismissed Smith's opening partner Travis Head with the new ball, but was then curiously held back by captain Corey Anderson as Smith and Maxwell torched the Unicorns' less credentialled bowlers.\n\nMaxwell hit four sixes en route to a 22-ball 40 but not even he could keep up with his long-time national teammate. He applauded when Smith, left out of Australia's T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, scooped Haris Rauf for the most daring of his six sixes.\n\nBy the time Cummins returned to dismiss Smith with a faster bouncer, and wicketkeeper Josh Inglis then leapt to take a stunning one-hander to account for Maxwell the following over, the damage had been done.\n\nWashington's 5-207, the highest score of this MLC season, proved 96 too many for San Fransisco, skittled for 111 with Inglis' 18 surpassed only by tailender Carmi le Roux hitting 20 in junk time.\n\nIt was the culmination of an impressive season from the Smith and Ponting-led Washington side that lost just one match all season.\n\nTheir other opener, Head, was named tournament MVP after hitting five consecutive fifties leading into the final, finishing with 336 runs at a strike-rate of 173.\n\n\"Everyone stood up at different times,\" said Smith.\n\n\"Our batting was strong – I don't think Marco (Jansen, the South Africa allrounder) even got a bat throughout the tournament batting at number eight.\n\n\"Travis Head was outstanding, it was nice to bat up the other end from him. He makes things a lot easier for me.\"\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk's fizzling follow-up to his breakout Indian Premier League campaign was capped as the Unicorns opener was dismissed for three to become the first of three Powerplay victims to the Freedom's left-arm pace pair, Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nWisconsin-born, Melbourne-raised Ian Holland had given Fraser-McGurk a life first ball when he fumbled a catch at point, but made up for his error when he took a tremendous diving outfield grab off Sherfane Rutherford amid a strong finish to the tournament for Maxwell (1-14).\n\nAndrew Tye (2-12), a late inclusion after Kiwi speedster Lockie Ferguson missed due to injury, got revenge over Inglis check-driving him for six by bowling his Perth Scorchers teammate to all but confirm Washington's triumph.\n\nAustralia's influence on the competition is certain to stretch beyond this season; Victoria and NSW have made long-term commitments to their Unicorns and Freedom franchises, while Cummins holds a four-year deal with the Unicorns, opening the door for other leading Australian to potentially join him in signing multi-year deals.",
    "summary": "* The MLC final was played between the Washington Freedom and the San Francisco Unicorns, with a distinctly Australian flavor, featuring eight Australians among the 22 finalists.\n* Steve Smith led the Washington Freedom to victory, scoring 88 off 52 balls, including six sixes, and shared an 83-run partnership with Glenn Maxwell.\n* The Freedom, led by Smith and coach Ricky Ponting, posted the highest score of the season, 207, which proved to be 96 runs too many for the Unicorns.\n* Pat Cummins, playing for the Unicorns, took 2-35 from four overs, but was outshone by Smith's batting performance.\n* Travis Head, the Freedom's opener, was named tournament MVP after hitting five consecutive fifties, finishing with 336 runs at a strike-rate of 173.\n* The Australian influence on the competition is set to continue, with Victoria and NSW making long-term commitments to their franchises, and Cummins holding a four-year deal with the Unicorns.",

He then moves on to collect the winning trophy.\n\nTravis Head is the Player of the Tournament for his consistent performance, scoring 336 runs for his team consisting of five half-centuries.. He says that he is looking forward to the few weeks off after this and he feels delighted to clinch the title. Adds that a few afternoon naps helps him chill before the game and then think of what to do when you arrive for training and see what the bowlers are bowling. Mentions that he is enjoying his life in USA and he has had a brilliant time even off the field playing Golf. Says that he and Smith complement each other and it felt nice to have a familiar face on the other end.\n\nThe Bart King Award for the best domestic player of the tournament goes to Hassan Khan for his all-round performance. He says that it has been a wonderful tournament and he is happy to contribute to the team's cause. Adds that he is fortunate for him to perform well with the bat and spend some time out in the middle. Says that the strength he has while batting is natural and mentions that the management trusted his batting and allowed him to bat higher up the order. Feels that having Pat Cummins in their dressing room was a valuable experience and he learned a lot from him.\n\nCorey Anderson, the captain of San Francisco Unicorns is up for a chat. He says they are extremely disappointed as they came here expecting to lift the trophy and failed to do so. Adds the Smith and Maxwell partnership took the game away from them and it is hard to stop those guys when they are on song and they failed to execute their plans. Mentions they came out confident while chasing this total but they lost wickets early and they faded very quickly in the pace and lost their way in the chase. Says he is proud of the side and the way the players have played throughout. Closes by saying that this competition is going from strength to strength and is on the way up as we see more and more International stars featuring here.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw a very strong batting performance from Washington Freedom. Steven Smith had to do the heavy lifting for a major part of the innings but when partnered with Glenn Maxwell, the runs came in from both ends and took them to a strong position. A sudden boost by Mukhtar Ahmed at the end powered them past 200. In the bowling department, it was Pat Cummins with his two wickets who shone out. Carmi le Roux had an off day and went wicketless while the others got one each.\n\nAndries Gous says it has been awesome and all players dream of lifting such a trophy. Mentions that this is such an amazing feeling to be crowned as champions. Thanks the fans for their support and the number in which they have come out to support them. Closes by saying that everybody wants to come to the USA and such a quality tournament will help their cause.\n\nRachin Ravindra from Washington Freedom is up for a short chat as well. He says he loved to play with so many international stars and the way the Aussie core planned and executed the skills shows why they are a champion side. Mentions that the boys had done the job early with both bat and ball and all he needed to do was pick up the last few at the end.\n\nRicky Ponting, the coach of Washington Freedom is up for a chat and says he arrived a bit late and left the training to the staff. Says that the backroom support was just tremendous. Mentions that Smith pretty much won the game single-handedly with the way he played and he executed what we had planned which was to play the natural way and not let the occasion get big on anyone. Mentions that the condition they have had has been fantastic and the way the sides have performed throughout the season has been brilliant as well.\n\nWe have some interviews lined up. Starting with Saurabh Netravalkar who says that he is grateful for this platform and sharing the dressing room with such stars is a nice feeling. Mentions that this could well be the backbone of domestic cricket for the USA and the crowd coming in is a good sign of things to come. Andrew Tye joins him and agrees with Netravalkar. He adds that it is a nice feeling to work with the unit and they learn a lot by picking their brains.\n\nWashington Freedom started off extremely well with the early wicket of Marco Jansen. Saurabh Netravalkar soon followed up in his second over. Jansen got rid of the dangerous Finn Allen as well to put his team in a strong spot. Glenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, and Andrew Tye worked in tandem to take 4 wickets in 3 overs. Jansen got rid of Hassan Khan and that left them with the bowlers to deal with. Rachin Ravindra did the cleaning up towards the end and sealed a win for them. Ravindra was the pick of the bowlers for his spell of 4-0-23-3 along with Marco Jansen with his spell of 4-1-28-3. Andrew Tye clinched two while Glenn Maxwell and Saurabh Netravalkar, who is the leading wicket-taker in this series ended his season with one to his name.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns had a shaky start. They didn’t look comfortable and Jake Fraser-McGurk succumbed first. Sanjay Krishnamurthy and Finn Allen couldn’t stitch a partnership and got sent back in a span of one over. Sherfane Rutherford, Josh Inglis, and Corey Anderson too couldn’t make any significant impact and played rash shots to throw their wicket away. Those three could only get 23 runs on the board. The Unicorns slipped from being 30/1 in 3.4 overs to 53/6 in 8.3 overs. That period was the one where the game slipped out completely from their hands. Cummins came in and played some lusty blows along with Hassan Khan but the curtains were already drawn for their side. It was then onto the bowlers who tried to free their arms before being cleaned up for 111 in 16 overs.\n\nW\n\nOvers15.6\n\nScore111 - 10\n\nRachin Ravindra to Juanoy Drysdale, OUT! CASTLED! That was the final nail in the coffin for San Francisco Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra seals things off and Drysdale departs. Looped full, turning away. Juanoy Drysdale misses his drive yet again and the ball turns away from his blade to crash into the off pole. He has been very handy with the ball for Washington Freedom and has always been the go-to bowler for Steven Smith throughout the tournament.\n\nW\n\nOvers13.5\n\nScore92 - 9\n\nRachin Ravindra to Haris Rauf, OUT! Goes down the track, misses and the keeper does the rest. Tossed up outside off, Haris Rauf dances down the track and looks to slog this but misses out completely. The ball is gathered by the keeper and Gous removes the bails with Rauf still wandering outside his crease.",

    "date": "Wed Jul 24 07:35:48 2024",
    "body": "In the final league match of the current Major League Cricket (MLC) season, Texas Super Kings (TSK) triumphed over Seattle Orcas (SEO) by 37 runs due to their exceptional bowling performance. A standout moment from the match was Mitchell Santner‘s massive six.\n\nMitchell Santner’s freakish six\n\nThe incident occurred during Ali Sheikh‘s second over, where he pitched an off-side delivery to Santner. Showing quick assessment and excellent timing, Santner read the line and length of the ball perfectly. With a confident and controlled bat swing, Santner executed a powerful shot that effortlessly cleared the boundary over the long-off and sailed into the stands. The shot showcased Santner’s batting prowess and demonstrated his ability to capitalize on scoring opportunities with precision and confidence.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Kieron Pollard’s heartfelt gesture after accidentally hitting a fan with his six in MLC 2024\n\nCommanding victory for Texas Super Kings\n\nSantner’s innings ended abruptly when Michael Bracewell outfoxed him in the subsequent over. Even after the fall of Santner, TSK were eventually successful in posting a fighting score with Calvin Savage played a blistering unbeaten knock of 45 off 27 balls which included 6 fours and 2 sixes helped the team to reach the total of 177/8 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nIn response Orcas lost their first wicket early with Ryan Rickelton gone for a duck. Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya tried to provide the stability to the team by adding 52 runs for the second wicket but soon they both got dismissed and middle order faltered after that. Keemo Paul tried to provide some resistence with the quick knock of 25 off 17 balls but failed to win the match for a side as the team could score only 140/9 in 20 overs. After securing a decisive victory against the Orcas, TSK advanced to the playoffs in third place and are now set to encounter MI New York in the eliminator at their home ground in Dallas.",
    "summary": "* The Texas Super Kings (TSK) won their final league match against the Seattle Orcas (SEO) by 37 runs, securing a spot in the playoffs.\n* Mitchell Santner played an exceptional shot, hitting a massive six off Ali Sheikh's delivery, showcasing his batting skills.\n* Despite Santner's dismissal, TSK posted a competitive score of 177/8 in 20 overs, thanks to Calvin Savage's unbeaten 45 off 27 balls.\n* SEO struggled in response, losing early wickets and eventually scoring only 140/9 in 20 overs, with Keemo Paul's 25 off 17 balls being the highest score.\n* With this win, TSK advanced to the playoffs in third place and will face MI New York in the eliminator at their home ground in Dallas.",

The first match of the tournament will be a rematch of the finals of the previous edition, where the Seattle Orcas will take on the MI-New York.\n\nThe Orcas will be looking to repeat their antics from the previous edition and try to go one better and lift the trophy this time. Before they begin their campaign, let us take a look at their team and try to analyse it.\n\nHere is a look at the Seattle Orcas team for the MLC 2024.\n\nBatters: Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, Hammad Azam, Nauman Anwar\n\nAll-rounders: Michael Bracewell, Harmeet Singh, Imad Wasim, Shehan Jayasuriya, Shubham Ranjane\n\nBowlers: Ali Sheikh, Nandre Burger, Cameron Gannon, Wayne Parnell, Ayan Desai, Zaman Khan\n\nStrengths of Seattle Orcas for MLC 2024\n\nHeinrich Klaasen and Quinton de Kock will be the strength of the Seattle Orcas batting [X]\n\nPower in batting\n\nQuinton de Kock will add power to the team's batting in the top order.

The presence of Heinrich Klaasen will give them the fuel to finish off on a string note.\n\nVariety and depth in the spin department\n\nThe presence of Harmeet Singh, Imad Wasim, and Michael Bracewell will provide great depth and variety to the spin department. These players can also contribute with the bat, adding further dynamism and flexibility to the team.\n\nWell-rounded pace department\n\nCameron Gannon was in great form in the last edition. He played a great role in the team's run to the final. Along with Gannon, Nandre Burger and Wayne Parnell look like a formidable pace attack. These bowlers can deliver at all stages of the game, and hence, the teams look sorted as far as their pace department is concerned.\n\nWeaknesses of Seattle Orcas for MLC 2024\n\nLack of experience and skill in the middle order\n\nA lot of the Seattle Orcas middle-order depends on Heinrich Klaasen. The South African batter will play a major role in carrying the team ahead. The other batters around Klaasen are Imad Wasim, Hammad Azam and Michael Bracewell. While there is a lack of experience in some of these players in crucial stages, the others are not in the best of forms. So, the middle order of the team looks a bit fragile and may succumb under pressure.\n\nSeattle Orcas Predicted XI for the first match",

The second edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC 2024) is, therefore, the next big thing in the cricketing calendar of 2024.\n\nWe at OneCricket will take a look at all the teams that will participate in the tournament and try to analyse them.

The presence of these three players not only allows the team management to have great dynamism and depth in the team but also gives them a lot of experience. The team will be depending a lot on these three legends of the format to have a much better campaign than last time, where they finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nSpencer Johnson will play a major role for LAKR in the tournament [X]\n\nWell sorted and assembeled bowling attack\n\nAndre Russell and Sunil Narine will give LAKR the flexibility to use them at any stage of the game.

They also have Adam Zampa and Shakib Al Hasan for the middle overs, and in the end, they have Ali Khan, who can be very efficient in the death overs. So, the bowling looks ready for all the phases of the game, and there is also plenty of strength and variety in it to go with.\n\nWeaknesses of Los Angeles Knight Riders for MLC 2024\n\nVolatile top-order\n\nIf the Knight Riders are not opening with Sunil Narine, then they have Unmukt Chand, Nitish Kumar and Jason Roy to open with. While Jason Roy looks like a good option, his lack of consistency is a concern for the team. Besides Roy, the likes of Chand and Kumar do not look like outright match-winners, and this can haunt the team during the campaign.\n\nThe team will depend a lot on the likes of David Miller and Alex Carey to give them stability and the strength in the middle-order.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Predicted XI for the First Match",

With a couple of days left at the start of the tournament, we at OneCricket will take a deeper delve into the MI New York side.\n\nThe MI New York played excellent cricket in the previous edition. Even after an average start to their campaign, MINY peaked at the right moment and made it to the summit clash of the tournament. In the final, Nicholas Pooran played one of the best T20 knocks and made the team the first-ever MLC champions.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at the MINY squad for the 2024 season and try to figure out their strengths and weaknesses ahead of the season.\n\nHere is a look at the MI New York squad for MLC 2024.\n\nBatters: Tim David, Monank Patel, Nicholas Pooran, Heath Richards, Shayan Jahangir, Steven Taylor\n\nAll-rounders: Dewald Brevis, Ruben Clinton, Kieron Pollard, Rashid Khan, Romario Shepherd\n\nBowlers: Trent Boult, Ehsan Ali, Noshthush Kenjige, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Rushil Ugarkar\n\nStrengths of MI New York for MLC 2024\n\nBrilliant Pace Unit\n\nTrent Boult will be leading the pace attack of MI New York [X]\n\nTrent Boult, Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje will be in charge of the pace department for MI New York in this edition. These three functioning together can be lethal against any batting line-up in the tournament. Alongside the three genuine pacers, MI have Romario Shepherd, who could play a supporting role and also contribute with the bat for the team.\n\nBalanced Spin Department\n\nWhile having a very potent and fear-striking pace attack, the MI New York team can also boast of a balanced spin department. Rashid Khan will be their prime spinner, and there are no questions about his skills and what he brings to the table in this format. Nosthush Kenjige will be aiding Rashid, and we have seen in the recently concluded World Cup that Kenjige can be a very efficient bowler in the middle overs. Alongside a powerful pace attack, the spin department also looks adequate to make run-scoring for the opposition batters a problem.\n\nPowerful middle-order\n\nMI New York will have Nicholas Pooran, Dewald Brevis, Kieron Pollard, and Tim David in the middle order. These four batters should be enough to strike fear in the minds of the opposition bowlers. These batters have the ability to decimate the opposition with power-hitting and change the complexion of a match at any stage. Besides these four, MINY also has Monank Patel, Rashid Khan, and Romario Shepherd, players who can be used around that powerhouse in the game's situation and the playing conditions.\n\nWeaknesses of MI New York for MLC 2024\n\nShayan Jahangir, Monank Patel and Steven Taylor will be the players MI New York will be looking to use as their openers in the tournament. While Shayan Jahangir and Monank Patel are stable batters, sometimes their scoring rate can be an issue for the team. On the other hand, Steven Taylor, who is a power hitter at the top, suffers from a bit of inconsistency. So, the MI team in MLC will depend a lot on their fire power in the middle in order to see them through most of the games.\n\nMI New York Predicted XI for the first match",

    "date": "Wed Jul 10 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "As the only small market in the six-team Major League Cricket, Seattle Orcas has an audacious plan to build its brand.\n\nIn a nod to the Dallas Cowboys, the world's most profitable sports team according to Forbes, the Orcas aim to become 'America's Team' in MLC - the lucrative pro T20 league that has just started a pivotal second season.\n\n\"We really are thinking about it for the long-term,\" Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar told me in a phone interview. \"We are not here thinking about MLC for the next five years and just saying 'let's get some value and move on'.\n\n\"There is no reason why we need to restrict this to just Seattle or the Pacific Northwest.\"\n\nForbesAmerica's Major League Cricket Set To Ride Momentum Of T20 World Cup\n\nMuch like the Seattle Sounders in Major League Soccer, whom Somasegar is part of the ownership group, the Orcas have encouraged passionate fans to get together and form the 'Pod Squad'.\n\n\"The squad is our way of saying we're going to get a group of people together who are excited about Seattle Orcas,\" said Somasegar, who has lived in Seattle for over three decades. \"And we think the 'Pod Squad' should exist not just in Seattle, but around the country.\n\n\"One guy from the Bay Area recently reached out to us and said that he had been watching MLC since it started. He said 'the way you guys have been inclusive, I'm a fan of your team more than any other. I like what you're doing and I want to be part of you'.\n\n\"So that's what we want to do and that's what we mean by becoming 'America's Team'.\"\n\nWhile inventiveness has made the Orcas stand out so far in the fledgling competition, cementing roots in the northwest seaport city will be vital for long-term success of the franchise.\n\nThe Orcas are an outlier compared to the other franchises based in the major locales of Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Washington DC and Dallas (Texas).\n\nSeattle beat out Atlanta and Chicago to complete the inaugural list of teams. As I reported recently, Atlanta and Chicago are set to be part of an expanded MLC in the coming seasons, while a move into Canada is also potentially on the cards.\n\nForbesChicago And Atlanta Could Be The Next Franchises In Major League Cricket\n\nParochialism is an advantage for the Orcas nestled in a relatively smaller market as underlined by the franchise being given more press coverage than its rivals. Exposure might be a bit easier for Orcas, but the hierarchy is keen to grow cricket from the ground up.\n\n\"We need to put a lot of effort into the community to not only get the right level of interest and excitement for the sport, but to also show kids that cricket can be a choice for them,\" said Somasegar, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group having spent 27 years working at Microsoft.\n\n\"We have this notion called 'cricket in a box', where we go to schools and show the basics of cricket. We're seeing early signs of traction. Our goal is to have cricket programs in schools.\n\n\"We need to cultivate cricket throughout the year because that's what is required for this sport to have a chance to be mainstream over a period of time.\"\n\nLike its debut season, where MLC exceeded financial expectations, the tournament is only being played in Dallas, the heartbeat of American cricket, and the more modest ground in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThere are plans amid an expanded MLC - played in a home and away format - for each franchise to have its own cricket stadium.\n\nA home ground for the Orcas has been planned at King County’s Marymoor Park, around 15 miles from Seattle, and likely to hold about 6000-8000 fans.\n\nIt is hoped to be ready by the 2026 season and possibly become a venue for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, where cricket will make its first Olympic appearance since 1900.\n\n\"My hope is Seattle has a stadium up and running by then because we have as much potential to host Olympic (cricket) games as anyone else,\" Somasegar said. \"That will be another great opportunity to showcase the sport in this country.\"\n\nThe Orcas are out to go one better after losing last year's final to MI New York, but lost the rematch in the opening game of this season.\n\nLike every other team, the Orcas have a mixture of international stars and local talent. Big names include big-hitting South Africans Heinrich Klaasen and Quinton de Kock, along with American sensation Aaron Jones who lit up the T20 World Cup.\n\nFor India-born Somasegar, building the blocks of a cricket franchise in his adopted home has become a dream come true.\n\n\"I grew up with cricket and derived so much pleasure from it in my life,\" he said. \"The vast majority of people in the U.S. have not experienced cricket, so this is building the sport from the ground up which is exciting.\n\n\"In Seattle, we have the loudest and most passionate sports fans in the country. There are a lot of great things happening here with technology and having big global companies in our backyard.\n\n\"It's a great place for cricket to be and it's satisfying playing a small role in this journey.\"",
    "summary": "**Seattle Orcas' Ambitious Plan**: The Seattle Orcas, the only small market team in the six-team MLC, aim to become \"America's Team\" by building a brand that resonates beyond Seattle and the Pacific Northwest.\n\n**\"Pod Squad\" Initiative**: The Orcas have encouraged fans to form the \"Pod Squad\", a group of passionate fans who can come together to support the team, not just in Seattle but across the country.\n\n**Community Focus**: The franchise is focused on growing cricket from the ground up by putting in effort to get kids interested in the sport and introducing \"cricket in a box\" programs in schools.\n\n**Stadium Plans**: A home ground for the Orcas is planned at King County's Marymoor Park, which is expected to hold 6,000-8,000 fans and be ready by the 2026 season.

    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns began their 2024 Major League Cricket season with an impressive six-wicket defeat of the Los Angeles Knight Riders in their opening match, whilst the Texas Super Kings suffered a defeat to LAKR before perhaps being saved by the rain for a no result against the Washington Freedom.\n\nDATE & TIME: Wednesday 10th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:00pm / USA PT – 12:00pm / West Indies – 2:00pm / UK – 8:00pm / South Africa – 9:00pm / Thursday 11th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:00am / India – 12:30am / Bangladesh – 1:00am / Australia – 5:00am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 34c or 93.2 F with clear, sunny skies\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: SPEEDY SAN FRANCISCO\n\nIn the inaugural season of Major League Cricket last year, the San Francisco Unicorns finished fifth with two victories and three defeats in their five matches. This time, though, the Unicorns demolished LAKR. They held them to just 165-6 in their 20 overs before chasing that down with six wickets to spare in just 15.2 overs with excellent innings’ from Finn Allen and Matt Short.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLWL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: DAD’S ARMY\n\nWith the influence of the so-called ‘Dad’s Army’ of the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League, the Texas Super Kings were beaten by 12 runs by LAKR in their opening game with TSK making just 150-8 in their 20 overs before then scoring 203-5 against the Washington Freedom. The rain helped them out, though, with the Freedom already on 62-0 in just four overs.\n\nLAST THREE: ALLLW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns were extremely impressive with both bat and ball in their defeat of LAKR. Their top four of Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Short and Josh Inglis will likely outscore anyone and a bet on the Unicorns to post a total in advance of 200, if they bat first, would be good value as they can go hard until quite late in the order with Liam Plunkett in at nine.\n\nFormer England international Plunkett performed his excellent ‘middle overs’ role well again in their opener as he took the wicket of former teammate Jason Roy with just the third ball outside of the powerplay. With TSK’s lineup structured to take the game deep, Plunkett will be pivotal and it would therefore be worthwhile to back Plunkett to be the Unicorns’ top bowler.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIn their opening encounter, the Texas Super Kings took seven wickets against LAKR but their most threatening bowler, Marcus Stoinis, picked up two wickets but went for 37 runs in his three overs. The most control was shown by Pakistani seamer Zia-ul-Haq and him to be their best bowler, once again, in what is a fairly weak attack, would appear a good bet for this one.\n\nWith the bat, TSK will have to think about upping the run rate with Faf du Plessis’ impressive century the other day still looking like it wouldn’t have been enough to defeat Washington. Stoinis found some touch with 29 off 18 and the Aussie all-rounder to continue to grow into the tournament with a 30+ score here would be worth having a go on.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS VS TEXAS SUPER KINGS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThe volatility in Twenty20 cricket means that tactical trends can be quite sweeping and come in quite quickly before fading just as fast. What is a point to mention here is that the top four of the San Francisco Unicorns features four of the modern-day white-ball players where they go hard from the off, whilst Devon Conway and Du Plessis open up for a TSK side looking to pragmatically get games won. There is perhaps no right or wrong way if you are eventually successful but it has to be said that the Unicorns, on a pitch now producing some very high scores, should simply be favoured to outscore their opposition.",
    "summary": "The San Francisco Unicorns have started their 2024 Major League Cricket season with a six-wicket victory over the Los Angeles Knight Riders, while the Texas Super Kings suffered a defeat to LAKR and then had a no result against the Washington Freedom due to rain.\n\nThe Unicorns restricted LAKR to 165-6 in 20 overs and then chased down the target in 15.2 overs, thanks to excellent innings from Finn Allen and Matt Short. The Texas Super Kings, on the other hand, were beaten by 12 runs by LAKR in their opening game, scoring only 150-8 in 20 overs.\n\nThe article provides betting analysis for the upcoming match between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings. The Unicorns are favored to post a total above 200 if they bat first, and Liam Plunkett is tipped to be their top bowler. For the Texas Super Kings, Zia-ul-Haq is expected to be their best bowler, and Marcus Stoinis is predicted to score 30+ runs.\n\nThe expert prediction is that the San Francisco Unicorns will outscore the Texas Super Kings in the upcoming match, given the Unicorns' strong top four and the high-scoring nature of the pitch.",

    "date": "Mon Jul  8 21:32:52 2024",
    "body": "Former India U-19 World Cup winning captain Unmukt Chand has opened up on his absence from USA's squad for the recently-concluded T20 World Cup. Chand took retirement from Indian cricket in 2021 before shifting base to the USA for better cricketing opportunities. After playing in the inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC), as well as other franchise tournaments, Chand became eligible to play for the USA. He had also expressed his wish of playing against India in the T20 World Cup, only to be left out of the squad.\n\nChand revealed that he was shocked after being left out of T20 World Cup squad, added that he had a feeling of being \"sucked inside\".\n\n\"That wasn't an ideal situation to be in. Because personally for me, this was what I had dreamed for the last three years. Obviously, it was a big shock. And it took me time to sort of come to terms with it.

I'm not even thinking about it,\" he added.\n\nChand, 31, has a point to prove, and started off the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) - USA's franchise T20 league - with a swashbuckling half-century.\n\nInterestingly, Chand's present MLC franchise is Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), who are owned by the Knight Riders group. Many might remember that Chand's downfall started when he was famously clean bowled by Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Brett Lee in the opening ball of IPL 2013. He made 68 off 45 balls, hitting six 4s and three 6s.",

    "date": "Tue Jul  9 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "The West Indies begin a three-match Test series against England on Wednesday which, regardless of the outcome, will give them an advantage before the two Tests against the Proteas next month.\n\nWhile the West Indies will be well up to speed with the Test format, by contrast, a large chunk of the 16 South African players named in the Test squad on Monday are either playing in the Major League Cricket T20 tournament in the US or not at all. Only David Bedingham, Wiaan Mulder and Matthew Breetzke are contracted on the county circuit.\n\nAt least that trio will have some first class matches under the belt and in Bedingham’s case, excellent form. Proteas coach Shukri Conrad said in a chat he had with Bedingham last week he told him to “save some runs for us”, after the 30-year-old surged to the top of the County Championship Division One run scorer’s list with an aggregate of 926 runs in 14 innings for Durham.\n\nHe has made five centuries and two half-centuries in that sequence, proving the decision to call him up for the Test squad last summer was overdue.\n\nBedingham’s form will be crucial, given he has rhythm in the longer format, something the MLC contracted players and those in South Africa will need to achieve through training camps and the sole warm-up match the squad will have in Trinidad before the first Test, which starts on August 7.\n\n“We have the luxury of a warm-up game and we have 10 days in Trinidad before the first Test,” said Conrad.\n\nPreparation for previous series against the West Indies and India last year were less than a week, so Conrad’s excitement about having 10 days is understandable.\n\n“You have to roll with the punches, this is the modern world. I’m comfortable that guys in America can take the flight across and we have a week’s preparation before the first Test. It is what it is and we will make it work.”\n\nThe build-up to the first Test between the West Indies and England that starts at Lord’s on Wednesday has been dominated by Jimmy Anderson, who is playing his 188th and final Test. That has helped overshadow the threat the West Indies pose, particularly with the ball.\n\nThough robbed of Kemar Roach, who was ruled out of the series with a knee injury, the West Indies still field a potent pace bowling trio in Jayden Seales, Alzarri Joseph and young sensation Shamar Joseph. The latter inspired the West Indies to their memorable victory over Australia in Brisbane earlier this year taking 7/68 in the second innings of that match.\n\n“They have a nice [set] of fast bowlers and having won in Australia they will have added confidence,” said Conrad.\n\nHe had a first-hand look at Seales and Joseph last season when the pair toured South Africa with a West Indies A team, so there will be no surprises there. Much like England will have noted in their preparation, the West Indies’ batting isn’t as strong.\n\n“There might be some frailties in the batting department that we can expose and exploit,” said Conrad.\n\nThe main frailty is inexperience. Among the batters, three haven’t played a Test, while three others — Kavem Hodge, Alick Athanaze and Kirk McKenzie — have a combined nine Tests between them.\n\nThey will be heavily reliant on captain Kraigg Brathwaite, former skipper Jason Holder, who wasn’t in Australia because he was contracted to the International League T20 in the UAE at the time, and wicketkeeper Joshua da Silva for their runs.",
    "summary": "* A large chunk of South African players named in the Test squad are currently playing in the Major League Cricket (MLC) T20 tournament in the US.\n* These players will need to adjust to the Test format quickly, as they will not have much preparation time before the two Tests against the West Indies next month.\n* The MLC contracted players will have to rely on training camps and a sole warm-up match in Trinidad to get ready for the longer format.\n* Coach Shukri Conrad is optimistic about the team's preparation, citing the luxury of a warm-up game and 10 days in Trinidad before the first Test.",

    "body": "Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) won their first match in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024, edging out Texas Super Kings (TSK) by 12 runs at the Grand Prairie Stadium. The match witnessed a dramatic turn of events, with Andre Russell’s bizarre dismissal adding a touch of misfortune to the Knight Riders’ hard-fought victory.\n\nLA Knight Riders sets competitive target\n\nBatting first, the Knight Riders posted a commendable total of 162/7 in their 20 overs. Unmukt Chand anchored the innings with a well-composed 68 runs, while Nitish Kumar chipped in with a valuable 26. The Super Kings’ bowling attack, spearheaded by Zia-ul-Haq‘s economical spell of 2/16, did well to restrict the flow of runs.\n\nAndre Russell’s bizarre dismissal\n\nThe turning point of the Knight Riders’ innings arrived in the 14th over. The big-hitting Dre Russ, known for his explosive batting, had a forgettable outing. Facing a yorker from Gerald Coetzee angling away from his body, Russell attempted a flick but ended up dislodging his own stumps with the bat while trying to play the shot. This comical yet crucial dismissal restricted him to a mere 10 runs off 5 deliveries.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Derone Davis takes a screamer to dismiss Joshua Tromp in TSK vs LAKR game at MLC 2024\n\nAli Khan shines for LAKR\n\nDespite Russell’s unfortunate exit, the Knight Riders bowlers rose to the occasion in the second innings. Right-arm pacer Ali Khan emerged as the hero, weaving a web of deception with his accurate fast bowling. His impressive spell of 4/33 put immense pressure on the Super Kings batters.\n\nChasing a target of 163, TSK started brightly with opener Devon Conway scoring a vital half-century (53 runs). However, the lack of substantial partnerships from other batters hampered their progress. The Knight Riders’ bowling attack, with Ali Khan leading the charge, maintained tight lines and lengths, stifling the Super Kings’ scoring rate. In the end, they fell short of the target by 12 runs, managing only 150/8 in their allotted 20 overs.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings shared the honours after their match in Major League Cricket 2024 at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina on Monday had to be called off due to heavy rain.\n\nSteve Smith and Travis Head had powered us to 62/0 in four overs after a rollicking start to the chase. Head hit two sixes and four fours in his unbeaten 32 off just 12 balls whereas Smith remained unconquered at 26 in only 13 balls striking three sixes and a boundary.\n\nBut rain had the final say as the game did not proceed further after four overs in the second innings.\n\nEarlier, Faf du Plessis top-scored in the match with 100 off just 58 balls to guide TSK to 203/5 in 20 overs. Saurabh Netravalkar was the pick among our bowlers with a tidy spell of 2/33 in four overs.\n\nPut into bat first, TSK got off to a good start reaching 67/0 at the end of the powerplay. Netravalkar broke the 109-run opening wicket partnership when he dismissed Devon Conway for 39, who was caught in the deep.\n\nAkeal Hosein struck in the next over to bring us back in the contest as we got two wickets in the space of five runs and TSK were 114/2 after 12 overs. But Faf du Plessis and Marcus Stoinis added a quickfire 62 off just 29 balls to take TSK past the 150-run mark.\n\nNetravalkar bowled an excellent penultimate over conceding just four runs including the wicket of centurion du Plessis as TSK finished at 203/5. Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen and Justin Dill chipped in with a wicket each.\n\nIn response, our skipper Steve Smith started from where he left off in the last match hitting three sixes and a four to give us a flying start. Travis Head too joined the party plundering 22 runs in the fourth over as we raced to 62/0 in just four overs.\n\nBut rain played spoilsport as the match had to be called off and both teams got a point each since the mandatory five overs were not completed for the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method to be used.\n\nWith that, we moved to the top of the MLC 2024 points table with three points from two matches.\n\nWe are up against the Seattle Orcas in the next match on Thursday at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.",
    "summary": "**Match Result:** The match between Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings was called off due to heavy rain, with both teams sharing the points.\n\n**First Innings:** Texas Super Kings scored 203/5 in 20 overs, with Faf du Plessis top-scoring with 100 off 58 balls.

    "date": "Thu Jul  4 15:15:09 2024",
    "body": "This side of the Earth was just host to one of the most exciting World Cups in recent memory and now the eyes of the cricketing world will remain fixed on the US as Major League Cricket gets ready to fire up its second season.\n\nLast year, it was Kieron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran, Rashid Khan, and MI New York that got to hoist the championship trophy in Texas. There's been a lot of player movement since last year and a lot of world-class cricketers will be playing in the league for the first time, but will anyone have the chops to dethrone MINY?\n\nMI New York\n\nThe New Yorkers didn't do a lot of tinkering with the roster that took home the title. With a batting lineup that includes Pollard, Pooran, Dewald Brevis, and Tim David and a bowling attack that features Rashid, Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and the US's best spin bowler in Nosh Kenjige, there simply wasn't a whole lot to do. The biggest absentee from last year's squad is David Wiese. While Wiese spent the last month helping anchor Namibia's World Cup team, his time spent with MINY in 2023 wasn't as memorable. If anything, New York's bowling -- which was already one of the scariest in the league -- will get a boost from South African speedster Anrich Nortje, who spent last year with Washington.\n\nWith a roster very similar to the one that won it all last year, MINY will be the team to beat this year.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nThe Orcas were the most consistent team in the league last year, taking a 5-1 record into the championship match. And, like MINY, they didn't do a lot of off-season roster movement. The team's core -- South Africans Heinrich Klaasan and Quinton de Kock, as well as Shayan Jayasuriya and Nauman Anwar (familiar names to fans of Minor League Cricket) -- remains intact.\n\nGone this year are Shimron Hetmyer and Andrew Tye. Seattle hopes to replace Hetmyer's bat -- though probably not his colorful hair -- with USA's Aaron Jones. Jones' 94 not out against Canada in the first match of the World Cup might be considered the spark that led the team to a berth in the Super Eights round. Making up Tye's lost overs will be South African Nandre Burger and West Indian Obed McCoy.\n\nLook for the Orcas to make another strong run at the MLC title again this year.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nThe Texas Super Kings wound up with the second-best record after the regular season, but back-to-back losses in the playoffs exposed the weaknesses that had haunted them throughout the campaign. Captain Faf du Plessis was abysmal as an opener and it seemed like they spent the early parts of every innings trying to claw back from a slow start.\n\nSo, what do you do? Well, if you're TSK, you clean house. Gone are the three of the team's top four run producers from last year -- Daniel Sams, David Miller, and Dwayne Bravo. And on the other side of the ball, gone are Gerald Coetzee and USA Cricket's Rusty Theron. That's a lot of runs and a lot of overs to make up.\n\nHoping to bring new life to the team and give TSK fans something to blow their whistles about are some big names: South African World Cup captain Aiden Markram, Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis, who played with San Francisco last year, and Afghanistan bowler Naveen ul-Haq. Another player to keep an eye on is 19-year-old Joshua Tromp, who lit up Minor League Cricket last year with the Houston Hurricanes.\n\nIf the new names come through, look for TSK to return to the playoffs. If they struggle, though, that's a lot of added pressure on captain Faf, Devon Conway, and domestic stars Milind Kumar and Calvin Savage.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nThe Freedom finished third in the league last year with a 3-2 record but were bounced in the first eliminator by the eventual champs, MINY. To make it back to the playoffs, Washington will have to deal with the departures of some big guns. Like TSK, they've seen the departure of three of their top four runs scorers from last year -- captain Moises Henriques, Matthew Short, and Glenn Phillips.\n\nThe team is in good shape, though, thanks to the addition of new captain, Australia's Steve Smith, New Zealand phenom Rachin Ravindra, and England's super solid Travis Head.\n\nThe Freedom's vicious bowling attack -- Marco Jansen, USA hero Saurabh Netravalkar, and West Indies spinner Akeal Hosein -- gets a boost from the addition of Lockie Ferguson. CricAmerica fave Dane Piedt won't be back with the team this year but look for some spin help from Amila Aponso and Akhilish Bodugum, who have both been impressive in minor league action.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nThe Unicorns started the 2023 campaign strongly. They left the Dallas portion of the schedule with a 2-1 record but were never able to get on track in Morrisville. They lost back-to-back matches at Church Street Park to see their playoff hopes dashed.\n\nThere are lots of new faces on the team in 2024. Captain Aaron Finch has been replaced by Australian all-around-good-guy Pat Cummins. While retaining their top run scorer in USA's Corey Anderson, the Unicorns will have a lot of runs -- and overs -- to make up with the departures of Matthew Wade and all-rounders Marcus Stoinis and Shadab Khan.\n\nHoping to fill that void are 22-year-old Aussie Jake Fraser-McGurk, who had a breakout Indian Premier League season for the Dehli Capitals, Matthew Short, who led the Washington Freedom in scoring last year, and Sherfane Rutherford, who just about single-handedly took down New Zealand in a vital West Indies World Cup win.\n\nThis could be an interesting year for San Francisco. Pat Cummins knows how to win; he captained Australia to titles in both the most recent World Test Championship as well as the 2023 Cricket World Cup. If he can get the Unicorns going in right direction, they could be a playoff contender.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nNo team had more flash and less success last year than the Knight Riders. With a batting lineup that included Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Rilee Rossouw, and Unmukt Chand and a bowling attack with two of the most creative spinners on the planet -- Sunil Narine and Adam Zampa -- as well as Lockie Ferguson and Ali Khan, they were beasts…on paper.\n\nIn reality, though, nothing clicked. They limped to a 1-4 record. And it wasn't even a pretty 1-4. They lost to TSK by 69 and got bowled out for 50 in a 105-run loss to MINY.\n\nThis year, they'll have to try it all again without Rossouw, who -- along with Russell -- was the only Knight Rider to crack 100 runs. Hoping to boost the offense is David Miller, who scored 143 for TSK last year and Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Also gone for 2024 is New Zealand quick Ferguson but LA hopes to make up the difference with Josh Little, who's had success in The Hundred and was the first Irish player to sign with the IPL.\n\nLAKR should be better than last year. Narine had a monster year for champions KKR in the IPL -- and West Indies fans can only wonder what would have happened if he was on the 2024 T20 World Cup team! If everyone else plays somewhat up to potential, the men in purple could make a run for the playoffs.\n\nThis season the Major League Cricket schedule is bumped up to seven matches for each team and games will -- once again -- be split between Grand Prairie Stadium outside of Dallas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. Matches will be broadcast over the Willow cable channel and app with various regional sports networks bringing the action to those who don't have Willow.",

    "body": "In the critical eliminator match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket, the Texas Super Kings (TSK) delivered a near-perfect performance, defeating defending champions MI New York (MINY) with a commanding 9-wicket victory.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York, Eliminator\n\nTexas Super Kings 167/1 (18.3 ov)\n\nMI New York 163/8 (20 ov)\n\nTexas Super Kings won by 9 wickets\n\nSCORECARD\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nThis win secured TSK's place in the challenger on July 26 and ended MI New York's campaign in the tournament.\n\nSet a target of 164, TSK's openers Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway laid a solid foundation. Du Plessis was in sublime form, smashing 72 off 47 balls, including six boundaries and three sixes. The duo put on a 101-run opening stand, effectively nullifying any hopes MI New York had of defending their total.\n\nConway let his skipper take charge, but after du Plessis was dismissed by Nosthush Kenjige, he took up the mantle with a steady 50* off 42 balls. Aaron Hardie joined Conway and continued the onslaught. Hardie’s quickfire 34* off 20 balls ensured that there was no late drama as TSK reached the target comfortably, finishing at 167/1 in just 18.3 overs. The win was sealed with a boundary from Hardie, capping off a dominant performance by the Super Kings.\n\nEarlier in the day, MI New York's innings got off to a rocky start after electing to bat first. Dewald Brevis fell for a duck in the very first over, caught by Stoinis off Zia-ul-Haq. Nicholas Pooran soon followed suit, managing just 8 runs before falling to Marcus Stoinis. At 3/2, MINY were in a dire situation.\n\nShayan Jahangir (26) and Monank Patel (48) attempted to stabilize the innings with a 49-run partnership. However, the scoring rate was kept in check by disciplined bowling from TSK. Patel's patient knock of 48 off 41 balls included five boundaries and a six, but it was Rashid Khan who provided the much-needed acceleration. Rashid's blistering 55 off 30 balls, featuring four sixes and four boundaries, propelled MINY to a respectable total.\n\nDespite Rashid's heroics, TSK bowlers ensured that MINY couldn't run away with the game. Marcus Stoinis was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with his two wickets while also conceding just 18 runs, while Noor Ahmad chipped in with 1/37 from his four overs.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-0 (Dewald Brevis - 0.4 ov), 2-18 (Nicholas Pooran - 3.4 ov), 3-67 (Shayan Jahangir - 10.1 ov), 4-102 (Monank Patel - 14.1 ov), 5-155 (Rashid Khan - 18.5 ov), 6-162 (Kieron Pollard - 19.4 ov), 7-162 (Heath Richards - 19.5 ov), 8-163 (Trent Boult - 19.6 ov)\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-101 (Faf du Plessis - 12.3 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nNoor Ahmad\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nMI New York\n\nDewald Brevis\n\nShayan Jahangir\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nMonank Patel\n\nHeath Richards\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nRomario Shepherd\n\nRashid Khan\n\nTrent Boult\n\nRushil Ugarkar\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Thursday, July 25, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: Texas Super Kings elected to bowl",

    "body": "oi-Avinash Sharma\n\nDallas, (TX), Jul 24: Led by Calvin Savage's stellar all-round performance, the Texas Super Kings handed the Seattle Orcas a comprehensive 37-run defeat in the final league match of the Major League Cricket 2024 at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, on Tuesday (July 23).\n\nDespite Quinton de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya giving the Orcas a solid start in their run chase, the Texas Super Kings' bowlers, led by Ottneil Bartmann (3/20), Noor Ahmad (2/19), and Calvin Savage (2/23), dismantled the Seattle batting lineup.\n\nWith the match's conclusion, Seattle Orcas finished their campaign with six losses and a sole victory, whereas the Texas Super Kings, who secured three wins and two losses (two no results), will play MI New York in the eliminator.\n\nSeattle Orcas' Run Chase Falters\n\nMirroring the first innings, the Seattle Orcas' run chase lost Ryan Rickleton (0) off the first ball of the innings to Ottneil Bartmann. Shehan Jayasuriya (24) joined Quinton de Kock (26), and the pair took control of the run chase. At the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 47/1.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya eventually fell to Calvin Savage in the seventh over after a 27-ball stint at the crease. Not long after, the dangerous Quinton de Kock was also dismissed, leaving the Orcas at 59/3 in the ninth over.\n\nFaced with a steep equation, the onus was on Heinrich Klaasen (4) and Matthew Bracewell (4) to steer the innings. However, both batters were outfoxed by spinners and dismissed for single digits. Mitchell Santner saw the back of Klaasen, while Bracewell was trapped lbw by Noor Ahmad.\n\nComing together with the score at 67/5 in 10.4 overs, Shubham Ranjane (16) and Keemo Paul (25) laboured to keep the Orcas in contention. However, Ranjane was run out and Keemo Paul was castled by Noor Ahmad before the 17th over, comprehensively extinguishing the run chase.\n\nAli Sheikh chipped in with a consolatory knock, but the Orcas fell well short, finishing at 140/9. Ottneil Bartmann took two wickets in the tail to finish with figures of 3/20.\n\nTexas Super Kings' Innings\n\nEarlier in the day, the Texas Super Kings lost opener Devon Conway (0) and Joshua Tromp (6) early in the innings. However, Faf Du Plessis (37) was in fine form, smashing six boundaries and a six before he was scalped by Keemo Paul. At the end of the power play, the Texas Super Kings were placed at 56/3.\n\nMilind Kumar (27) played a watchful knock, scoring nearly a run-a-ball before he became Keemo Paul's second wicket of the day. The experienced all-rounders, Marcus Stoinis (11) and Mitchell Santner (15), both got starts but failed to convert them into bigger scores, falling to Aryan Desai and Matthew Bracewell, respectively.\n\nCalvin Savage (45*) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson. The pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings. Stevenson (17) struck a four and six to support Savage's late innings fireworks, but was cleaned up by Nandre Burger in the 18th.\n\nSavage hammered Bracewell for two consecutive maximums in the 16th over and went on to script a 17-run over off Nandre Burger's 18th over to remain unbeaten and help the Texas Super Kings finish at 177/8.\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nTexas Super Kings 177/8 (Faf Du Plessis 39 off 17, Calvin Savage 45* off 27, Keemo Paul 2/18, Aryan Desai 2/30)\n\nSeattle Orcas 140/9 (Quinton de Kock 26 off 19, Keemo Paul 25 off 17, Ottneil Bartmann 3/20, Noor Ahmad 2/19)\n\nResult: Texas Super Kings won by 37 runs.",
    "summary": "The Texas Super Kings defeated the Seattle Orcas by 37 runs in their final league match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. Calvin Savage's all-round performance led the Super Kings to victory, with Ottneil Bartmann, Noor Ahmad, and Savage himself taking multiple wickets to dismantle the Orcas' batting lineup. The Orcas finished their campaign with one win and six losses, while the Super Kings will play MI New York in the eliminator with three wins and two losses (and two no results). The Super Kings scored 177/8 in their innings, led by Faf Du Plessis' 37 and Calvin Savage's unbeaten 45, while the Orcas were restricted to 140/9 in response, with Quinton de Kock and Keemo Paul scoring 26 and 25 respectively.",

Washington are on a good run of form in the MLC. Who will win this game of cricket?\n\nReceive Your Welcome Bonus!\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns form\n\nCorey Anderson and his men have taken their positive energy flowing from the humbling of Washington Freedom last night. The underdogs took down the top team in the table so this must have served as a big boost coming into this action. He believes in his team making an interesting fight banked on Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk to be an explosive opening pair. High expectations rest on Sanjay Krishnamurthi, who played a match-winning knock in the last game. Josh Inglis and Matthew Short are the other two middle-order batsmen. Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan will be important as they come in to add runs during the later moments. The bowling will be under scrutiny, with bowlers like Brody Couch and Hassan Khan expected to do the job. Liam Plunkett and Haris Rauf will be experienced enough to shine during the middle overs. While both Anderson and Tajinder Dhillon are expecting to play effective supporting roles.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns Predicted Lineup\n\nCorey Anderson, Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short, Josh Inglis, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Hassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Tajinder Dhillon\n\nWashington Freedom form\n\nIn their most recent league match, the Washington Freedom took a dent as they lost the contest against the San Francisco Unicorns by a margin of 6 wickets. The loss was the first for Steven Smith's side in what was turning out to be a fine season till now. They have been fantastic in most of the matches and, primarily, the batsmen have put the opposition teams' bowling attacks under a lot of pressure. The Unicorns are a team that Steven Smith and his side would want to face in their second encounter to return to winning ways.\n\nThe consistency of Travis Head and Steven Smith at the top order has been quite crucial. This pair will, therefore, be relied upon to provide a solid start in the forthcoming match. Andries Gous has been solid at No. 3 and will look to stitch partnerships with Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell in the middle order. The lower middle order comprising Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, and Marco Jansen will be expected to contribute quick runs.\n\nThe bowling has been good as a unit throughout the season, and it would want Marco Jansen and Jasdeep Singh to provide it a good start. Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar have to bowl good tight spells in the middle overs. Also, Maxwell and Ravindra can support the team in bowling.\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted Lineup\n\nSteven Smith (c), Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, Andries Gous (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Marco Jansen, Saurabh Netravalkar, Lockie Ferguson, Jasdeep Singh\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns vs Washington Freedom Expert Tips & Prediction\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns have a good record of batting but their attack of them in bowling is not that strong, so it's going to be hard for the bowlers against the hitters in the team of Washington Freedom. Washington Freedom has the best number of top orders with a good run in the form, adding to the balanced bowling attack, surely the game is going to be of favor in the pocket of them. So, Washington Freedom will bag the honours over here.",

    "body": "Afghanistan’s star all-rounder, Rashid Khan, illuminated the crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium with a scintillating half-century for MI New York in their Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 Eliminator clash against the Texas Super Kings.\n\nRashid, batting higher in the order than usual, unleashed a barrage of powerful strokes during his 30-ball innings, amassing 55 runs. His explosive performance included a standout moment with an innovative shot that featured prominently in the highlights of the New York innings, which concluded at 163/8 in their 20 overs.\n\nRashid Khan’s unique stroke play\n\nRashid is well-known for his ability to replicate MS Dhoni’s signature ‘helicopter’ shot, a swift aerial flick from near the off-stump to the on-side, often resulting in a six. However during the match, Rashid introduced a unique shot of himself.\n\nFacing a delivery from pacer Aaron Hardie, Rashid innovatively adjusted his approach. On the last ball of the 17th over, with a delivery marginally short and outside off-stump, Rashid sat deep in his crease and, with a powerful whip of his bat, sent the ball soaring over wide long-on for a spectacular six.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso READ: Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024: Broadcast, live streaming details – When and Where to watch in India, US, UK, Australia & other countries\n\nMI New York’s challenging start\n\nNew York’s innings got off to a rocky start after being asked to bat first by TSK. They lost opener Dewald Brevis for a duck and Nicholas Pooran for 8, both wickets falling inside the first four overs, leaving the team at a precarious 18 for 2.\n\nShayan Jahangir and Monank Patel then steadied the innings with a 39-run partnership before Dwayne Bravo disrupted it by dismissing Jahangir for 26 off 23 balls. Rashid then joined Patel, and although the duo added a promising 35 runs, Patel was dismissed by spinner Noor Ahmad for a well-made 48 off 41 balls.\n\nRashid’s impactful innings\n\nDespite the interruptions, Rashid’s innings proved crucial. He counter-attacked with flair, hitting Bravo and Noor for boundaries, and scored two consecutive sixes off Hardie. His aggressive batting helped elevate the score to a competitive 163, though Romario Shepherd and New York’s captain, Kieron Pollard, contributed modestly. Rashid’s innings, characterized by 4 fours and 4 sixes, came at an impressive strike rate of 183.33. It marked the fourth time he has scored a fifty in T20 cricket.\n\nVictory for the Texas Super Kings\n\nIn the second innings, despite a brief rain delay complicating conditions, Rashid delivered a disciplined spell of bowling. He was introduced in the fourth over and conceded only four runs. Over his four-over spell, he maintained tight control, giving away just 22 runs.\n\nNevertheless, despite Rashid’s efforts, the Texas Kings chased down the target with ease. The leading run-scorer of the tournament, Faf du Plessis, continued his exceptional form, scoring another fifty and guiding TSK to a nine-wicket victory, thus winning the crucial Eliminator game.",

The pacer has been ruled out due to a side strain, an injury sustained during his stint with the Texas Super Kings in Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024.\n\nCoetzee had been making significant strides in his Test career and his absence will undoubtedly be felt by the Proteas. The young pacer’s ability to generate pace and bounce made him a valuable asset to the team, and his unavailability is a significant blow to South Africa’s bowling attack.\n\nReplacement announced\n\nIn a bid to bolster their pace bowling options, South Africa have called up Migael Pretorius, uncapped at Test level, as Coetzee’s replacement. The bowling all-rounder brings a wealth of first class cricket experience and versatility to the side, capable of contributing both with the bat and the ball.\n\nPretorius’ inclusion adds depth to the Proteas squad and provides a viable option for the team management.

    "body": "The cricket system in the USA, similar to in different parts of the world, isn’t always without its flaws. Although it represents a vast emerging marketplace for the game, its early years were marred by controversies. Despite these challenges, one positive development has been the establishment of Major League Cricket (MLC), a premier T20 competition.\n\nMLC has created a platform for players from diverse countries and backgrounds to interact with some of the sport’s biggest names. This league provides an indirect pathway for Indian cricketers, who are unable to play outside of India, to showcase their talents if they relocate to the USA for various reasons.\n\nAs MLC 2024 approaches the qualifiers, three Indian-born players are particularly keen to make their mark. Let’s take a closer look at their stories:\n\n1. Milind Kumar – Texas Super Kings\n\nRight-handed batsman Milind Kumar was once quite a celebrity in Indian domestic cricket. He began his career in the Ranji Trophy with his hometown Delhi before moving to Sikkim for the 2018-19 season, where he emerged as the highest run-scorer with 1331 runs beating the top players as the faces of Wasim Jaffer and Rinku Singh .\n\nKumar had brief spells in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) and Royal Challengers Bangalore. However, limited opportunities led him to move to the USA around 2021, where he initially played in Minor League Cricket. His impressive performances there earned him a spot in the Texas Super Kings (TSK) for the inaugural MLC season. Kumar has since secured his place in the team, regularly batting at number five under the leadership of Faf du Plessis.\n\nThis season, Kumar contributed to TSK’s third-place finish in the league stage. His early matches included a couple of unbeaten innings, though he didn’t have much to bat in those games. He later scored two runs each in two consecutive matches before making a decent 29 (28) against the Seattle Orcas just before the playoffs.\n\n2. Monank Patel – MI New York\n\nMonank Patel is a well-known figure as the captain of the USA national team, which he led commendably during the recent 2024 T20 World Cup, including scoring a half-century against Pakistan. Born in Anand, Gujarat, Patel moved to the USA permanently in 2016 to open a restaurant in New Jersey, having earned his green card in 2010.\n\nAlthough Patel played only age-group cricket in Gujarat, his cricketing development primarily occurred in the USA, leading to his international debut in 2018. As a keeper-batsman, he has struggled to replicate his international form in MLC.\n\nLast season, he managed just 63 runs, and in the current edition, apart from a notable 61-run inning against TSK in a losing effort, he has not surpassed eight runs in six other games. However, his potential to shine in critical matches might still come through as MLC progresses.\n\n3. Saurabh Netravalkar – Washington Freedom\n\nThe journey of Saurabh Netravalkar is one of the most famous stories in Indian cricket teams. Born in Mumbai in 1991, the leading wicket-taker in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup is a promising left-arm spinner. Netrawalkar moved to the US. in 2015 to pursue a career in software engineering but continued his passion for cricket, which ultimately led to his international debut for the US\n\nIn MLC 2024, Netra Valkar has confirmed her growing popularity. Despite missing two matches due to the birth of a child, he picked up 12 wickets in five games, making him the top wicket-taker in the tournament and his performances, especially in the powerplay, have been significant in the Washington Freedom victory, helping them gain the top spot in the league table.\n\nAlthough he went wicketless against the San Francisco Unicorns in a recent match, he is expected to bounce back strongly in the upcoming qualifier against the same team. These three players highlight the opportunities MLC provides for cricketers with diverse backgrounds and journeys, fostering a unique cricketing ecosystem in the USA.",

The MLC 2024 game will be available to watch via live streaming and broadcast.\n\nThe top two teams in the MLC 2024 points table will meet in the Qualifier and the winning team will directly proceed to the final. The losing side will have one more shot at redemption when they meet the winners of the Eliminator contest, a match between the third and fourth-placed teams.\n\nWe lost to SFU by six wickets (DLS method) in our last league game in Dallas on Monday, the first defeat of our MLC campaign this year.\n\nHowever, we finished on top of the MLC 2024 points table with 11 points from seven games, ahead of SFU on net run rate.\n\nTravis Head and skipper Steve Smith shone at the top of the order with half-centuries while Andrew Tye picked up three wickets, albeit in a losing cause, in a rain-shortened encounter.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar is on top of the bowling charts in MLC 2024 with 12 wickets from just five matches at an average of 12.16 runs and an astonishing strike rate of 9.16.\n\nMeanwhile, Head and Smith have moved to second and third in the overall batters’ list.

For a change, Smith outscored his left-handed opening partner during the powerplay.\n\nOur skipper smashed three sixes and five fours as he raced to 44 off just 22 balls to power us to 70/0 after the first six overs. Meanwhile, Head shifted gears, once Smith departed, to complete his fourth straight fifty in MLC.\n\nBoth Smith and Head were involved in a record partnership adding 101 runs, our highest for any wicket in the MLC, for the opening wicket against SFU. The duo have scored a total of 497 runs out of our total 936 runs this season, a whopping 53%, at a fast clip as well. Another flying start on Thursday and we will have one leg in the final.\n\nTye, playing his first game of the season, picked up three wickets against SFU in our last match. Though Tye was a bit expensive, he dismissed big-hitters Jake Fraser-McGurk, Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford, the last two in the same over, to keep us in the game right through the defense.\n\nMeanwhile, Netravalkar will be our trump card once again with his best spell in the MLC coming against the same opponent last year. His astonishing figures of 6/9 against SFU in 2023 helped us win a low-scoring game by a comfortable 30-run margin.\n\nWashington Freedom squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs SFU Qualifier MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nLIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns match will be available on Monumental Sports Network and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA.

    "body": "DHAKA, July 2, 2024 (BSS) - Ace allrounder Shakib Al Hasan said he wants to focus solely on cricket at this moment, rather than thinking about the future of his career.\n\n\"I don't have any plan for myself at this moment. I have two T20 tournaments ahead of me--an MLC (Major League Cricket) organized by USA and the next is Canada's Global T20. I will play those two tournaments and see how it is going. After that, there is a Test series against Pakistan and I will play that series. That's the plan for now,\" Shakib said here today as he was leaving the country for USA to play MLC.\n\nShakib had below par T20 World Cup campaign this year, which encouraged his critics to lash out at him vehemently. They raised their voice high about his immediate retirement, citing the reason that at the age of 37, it would be tough for the allrounder to regain his form.\n\nEarlier, Shakib revealed that he would retire from the cricket after the Champions Trophy in 2025 but recently in an interview with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) he revealed that he wants to play another ODI World Cup which is in 2027.\n\nBut it looked he changed his plan again.\n\n\"I didn't really plan too much. I need to understand my physical condition. At this moment it is not possible for me to plan for the next three or four years. I think it's better to plan for three or six months. For the time being, my plan is for Pakistan series, then I will see what next for me,\" Shakib added.\n\nBangladesh won three matches of the group phase in T20 World Cup and moved up to the Supe 8 for only the second time in tournament's history. However they lost all three matches in Super 8 phase and even though they had the golden chance to make it semifinal, Bangladesh's safe cricket sank them at the end.\n\n\"May be we didn't play all out cricket. We didn't get the kind of results we expected or the kind of results we had a chance of getting. We fulfilled the initial (Super Eight) target, so it is successful from that point of view. It's a bit disappointing for us because we couldn't go to the semifinal.\"\n\nIn response to a query why they couldn't make it possible to make it semis, Shakib said, 'It is difficult to say. In fact, I am sure those who are there will decide that why we can't make it. The coach, captain, team and others who are in the cricket operations, board and others will discuss together to sort it out.\"",

Bangladesh are scheduled to play two Tests and three T20Is against India from September 19 to October 12 following their tour of Pakistan in August, where they are slated to play a two-match Test series.\n\nThe legendary all-rounder departed from Dhaka to the USA on Monday, July 1, to take part in the second edition of MLC. He will be plying his trade for Los Angeles Knight Riders, who finished last in the inaugural season last year. Shakib informed that he isn't thinking too far ahead, having only planned till the tour of Pakistan next month.\n\n“I don't have many plans. There are two T20 tournaments in front of me one is MLC and the other one is the Global T20 League in Canada and let me see where I stand after playing these two tournaments because I need to understand [how I feel],” Shakib was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.\n\n“There is international cricket and there is a series against Pakistan, and I am planning till that point of time and not planning beyond that. Now I don't have time to plan for three-four years and so planning for three to six months is better and later will think about my next plan and so till now I am planning till the Pakistan series,” the experienced cricketer added.\n\nAlso Read: Warner, Babar, Narine, Shakib among galaxy of stars to light up GT20 Canada 2024\n\nTaskin Ahmed apologized for missing the team bus: Shakib\n\nTaskin Ahmed was surprisingly left out of the playing XI in Bangladesh's crucial Super Eights fixture in the recently concluded T20 World Cup 2024 against eventual champions India in Antigua. A Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official had recently revealed that the pacer woke up late in the morning and missed the team bus. Shakib also spoke along those lines and said that the 29-year-old apologized for his negligence.\n\n“The team bus starts at a certain point and there is a rule for cricketers that team bus does not stop for anyone and if anyone misses it in that case he comes in the next car. The manager's car or a taxi is there and the support of transport was difficult in the West Indies. When Taskin arrived it was five to 10 minutes before the toss, and certainly it was difficult to pick him at that point in the team and it was difficult for him as well,” Shakib said.\n\nAlso Read: T20 World Cup 2024: Taskin Ahmed apologises for missing team bus after waking up late for India game\n\n“Taskin apologized to the team for that afterwards and everyone in the team took it normally because a man can mistake and anyone can commit unintentional mistake, and he accepted it and the thing ended at that point of time,” the cricketer said.",

The 2024 season starts July 5, with the Championship Final taking place at Grand Prairie Stadium on July 28. Here’s your guide to the upcoming exciting season of the MLC in the USA.\n\nHow many teams are going to participate?\n\nJust like the inaugural season, the second season of the MLC will see all the six founding teams clashing against each other with the Seattle Orcas, MI New York, LA Knight Riders, Washington Freedom, San Francisco Unicorns and Texas Super Kings battling it out\n\nWhere is it going to be played?\n\nAfter the success that was the first season, the league will be played across the two venues which also hosted the matches last year - Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nHas the format changed?\n\nYes. The league's first season was played in a single round robin format with 15 league stages matches. However, the second season will see an increase to 21 league games, with each of the teams playing seven games instead of five last season. The tournament will then move to the playoff stages, which will follow the same format as the first season with a Qualifier, Challenger and Eliminator to be played before the summit clash.\n\nMLC has been given List A status. What does that mean?\n\nEarlier this year, the ICC awarded the MLC with List A status, making it only the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire the status from the game’s governing body. This basically means all the records, runs, wickets and stats acquired in the MLC will now be added to the official records of the format. It also means that MLC is now an official T20 League, much like the IPL or the SA20 or Big Bash League.\n\nHow long are the games?\n\nThe T20 format is a shortened version of cricket that lasts approx 3- 3 ½ hours.\n\nWhere can we watch MLC?\n\nTo cheer on your Seattle Orcas in person, all matches will be broadcast at all 5 locations at Flat Stick Pub (https://flatstickpub.com/locations/). For more info check out our watch party events on Facebook.\n\nKirkland\n\nRedmond\n\nPioneer Square\n\nSouth Lake Union\n\nBellingham\n\nSpokane\n\nThe broadcasters vary, so check your local listings to see if these are included in your channel package:",

The air is thick with anticipation, the sound of leather on willow echoes in our dreams, and suddenly, everyone's googling \"What's a googly?\" Yes, folks, Major League Cricket (MLC) is back for its sophomore innings, and it's about to turn the USA into a cricketing colosseum!\n\nPicture this: stadiums packed with fans donning team colors, the rhythmic chants of \"USA! USA!\" mixed with \"Howzat!\", and hot dogs sharing menu space with samosas. It's a cricketing carnival that's as American as apple pie... served with a side of mango chutney!\n\nMLC 2024 isn't just a tournament; it's a cultural phenomenon, a sports revolution, and quite possibly the best reason to call in sick to work this July. It's promising more googlies, yorkers, and sixes than you can shake a willow at. So, let's dive into this cricketing extravaganza that's about to hit American shores for a six!\n\nThe Teams - A Six-Pack of Cricketing Fury\n\n1.

Whether you know your leg before wicket from your elbow before watch, MLC 2024 promises more entertainment than a Netflix binge. So, grab your popcorn (or cucumber sandwiches, if you're feeling proper), and come watch cricket history being made. It's going to be just like baseball... if baseball was interesting for more than 5 minutes at a time!\n\nNow, here's a googly you'll want to play: the Sulekha coupon! Think of it as your secret weapon, your ticket to cricket nirvana. By using the code 'SULEKHA2024', you're not just getting a 20% discount, you're practically stealing runs from the ticketing system! It's like hitting a six when you only needed a single - overachieving at its finest!\n\nBut wait, there's more! This isn't just any old coupon. Oh no, the 'SULEKHA2024' code is your VIP pass to the cricketing event of the year. It's like having Sachin Tendulkar as your personal batting coach, or Shane Warne teaching you to spin - it's that good! So don't let this googly of an opportunity slip through to the keeper.\n\nRemember, in cricket and in life, you miss 100% of the shots you don't play. And with the Sulekha coupon in your arsenal, you're already ahead of the game. It's time to pad up, step onto the pitch, and be part of American cricket history.\n\nHowzat for a summer plan? Now, off you go! May your tickets be cheap, your seats be prime, and may the odds be ever in your favor (wrong franchise, but you get the idea). See you at the cricket!",

    "date": "Wed Jul 10 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "For Major League Cricket organizers, the timing couldn’t be better.\n\nOn the heels of a T20 men’s cricket World Cup in which the American co-hosts scored a signature victory over Pakistan in the group stage, the domestic cricket league sees momentum for greater growth.\n\nMLC opens its second season July 5, six days after the World Cup final won by India. Organizers hope the United States’ success helps push the sport, and ultimately the league, more deeply into America’s sports consciousness.\n\n“Cricket has tried and failed in this country for probably 25, 30 years,” MLC director Justin Geale said. “This is the furthest anyone’s got, so we’ve got to keep that momentum going.”\n\nCricket’s global popularity may come as a shock to some American sports fans.\n\nIt is the most popular sport in India, the world’s most populous country, and enjoys similar appeal in parts of the Caribbean and countries such as England, South Africa and Australia. The Indian Premier League, the country’s top domestic T20 circuit, has grown into one of the world’s most lucrative leagues; and the sport, which is the second-most-watched in the world, will return to the Olympics in 2028 following a 128-year hiatus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious attempts to find a place for cricket in the American sports landscape haven’t worked out.\n\nShort-lived Pro Cricket operated an eight-team league in 2004. It aimed to capitalize on the advent of professional T20 cricket in the United Kingdom but folded after one season. (T20, or Twenty20, is a faster, shortened version of the sport.) The American Premier League, another T20 competition, failed to launch in 2009, though it finally got off the ground in 2021.\n\nMajor League Cricket debuted in July 2023. The league features six teams: from New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and Grand Prairie, Tex. (near Dallas), competing in the T20 format. Bolstered by $120 million in investment, those teams include some of the top players in the world who are able to play during their offseasons. Games have been contested only in Texas and North Carolina, but organizers say most of the funding will be used for building or upgrading eight venues across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir goal is to grow the sport in America, ideally beyond the South Asian diaspora. They said they don’t want to compete for sports supremacy with the NFL or the NBA. MLC aims to capitalize on burgeoning interest in cricket so the league can eventually become a more casual presence in American sports fans’ lives — and benefit from the more lucrative broadcast deals that expansive popularity invites.\n\nA promising first season outperformed the league’s expectations, with games selling out at the venue (capacity: 3,500) in Morrisville, N.C., outside Raleigh, and those in the stadium in Grand Prairie (capacity: 7,200) averaging more than 80 percent capacity. Saurabh Netravalkar, a breakout star at the World Cup, and other players said they were pleasantly surprised by the professionalism and quality of competition.\n\n“We learned an awful lot,” Geale said. “What’s most pleasing is it actually worked. You spend three years trying to plan and you theorize, but people actually came, so our crowds were really positive — and we didn’t help ourselves. We’re playing in Texas in the middle of summer.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe league’s priority now is building venues in other cities to connect with fans in those areas. It is a critical but ongoing challenge that could have teams relying on temporary facilities such as the one used in New York for the World Cup as they work to secure more permanent grounds.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas are developing a stadium east of the city in Redmond, Wash., and the San Francisco Unicorns are planning a Santa Clara venue the team hopes will become part of a larger sports and entertainment hub. The Washington Freedom was in negotiations with George Mason University to build a temporary baseball and cricket stadium on the Northern Virginia school’s west campus, but plans fell through in March after students and local residents opposed the project, and the university president later said it “does not meet the strategic objectives and interests of our campus and community and the Washington Freedom.” Franchises in New York and Los Angeles also are seeking stadiums.\n\nThat’s why teams play in North Carolina and Texas, though the league has mandated each team secure a home ground by 2028, when Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our biggest challenge is infrastructure. If we had more places to play, we’d go and play, so that’s holding back our growth,” Geale said. “We’re looking to build stadiums as quick as we can in all these areas. As soon as we can do that, I think we can grow quicker, the season can get longer; we can really talk to local fans and build a brand around, say, the Washington Freedom, rather than trying to do that over a distance.”\n\nFor players, that can mean little to no connection to their “home” city for the time being.\n\nLast season, Freedom players attended a preseason camp in the Dallas area a few weeks before the start of the season in July. The first half of their schedule was in Texas, the second half in North Carolina, then back to Dallas for the playoffs. Netravalkar plays for the Freedom while working as a software engineer for Oracle in the Bay Area. He said last year he only ventured east for MLC events in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhead of Year 2, some things will change.\n\nMLC games were broadcast in more than 80 countries last year and were shown via Sling TV and Willow TV, which streams overseas cricket events. Select games aired on CBS Sports Network. To expand coverage in 2024, MLC is negotiating partnerships with regional sports networks in its six cities. There will be six more matches on the schedule, up from 19. Teams such as the Freedom are considering how to engage their local fans from a distance — through clinics, meet-and-greets or contests where winners are flown out to watch games in person.\n\nDespite its stadium struggles, MLC is poised for expansion. Geale said it could add two teams by 2026 and is eyeing franchises in Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto, New Jersey and South Florida.\n\nMLC has a developmental minor league through which it is helping cultivate young domestic talent. Over time, the idea is for pro teams and their players to be more involved in their communities through coaching, mentorship and other forms of outreach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there is the development of the U.S. men’s and women’s national teams.\n\nThe men’s upset over 2022 T20 World Cup runner-up Pakistan last month helped them qualify for the tournament’s second round, called the Super Eight, where the team’s dream run ended. Still, its advancement means it automatically qualifies for the 2026 edition of the tournament hosted by India and Sri Lanka. Geale believes the success drives more attention to the sport and opens the door for the league to negotiate better broadcast opportunities.\n\nNetravalkar, a bowler for the U.S. national team, said MLC already has contributed to that effort.\n\n“I think Major League the first season really helped us because that gave us the platform to play on quality pitches within the U.S. and to sort of rub shoulders with some of the top cricketers across the globe in front of good crowds,” he said.\n\n“It’s really heartening to see that cricket has arrived,” he added. “We planted a seed for growth, and Major League being immediately after the World Cup helps a lot to continue that trajectory and make it even bigger.”",
    "summary": "**Timing and Momentum**: The MLC's second season is set to start on July 5, just six days after the T20 men's cricket World Cup final, which could help capitalize on the momentum of the US team's recent success.\n\n**Background**: Cricket is the second-most-watched sport in the world, but previous attempts to establish a professional league in the US have failed. MLC debuted in July 2023 with six teams competing in the T20 format, featuring top players from around the world.\n\n**Season 1**: The first season of MLC outperformed expectations, with sold-out games in Morrisville, NC, and high attendance in Grand Prairie, TX. The league received positive feedback from players and fans alike.\n\n**Challenges and Goals**: The league's biggest challenge is building infrastructure, including permanent venues in each city. The goal is to create a more casual presence in American sports fans' lives and eventually secure more lucrative broadcast deals.\n\n**Expansion and Growth**: MLC is planning to expand to new cities, including Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto, New Jersey, and South Florida, with the aim of adding two new teams by 2026. The league is also developing a minor league to cultivate young domestic talent and plans to increase community outreach and engagement.\n\n**Broadcast and Partnerships**: MLC games will be broadcast in more than 80 countries, and the league is negotiating partnerships with regional sports networks in its six cities. Select games will air on CBS Sports Network.\n\n**US National Teams**: The success of the US men's national team, including their upset win over Pakistan, has helped drive more attention to the sport. MLC's director believes this will open up better broadcast opportunities for the league.",

Playing for Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) in USA's Major League Cricket (MLC), Russell hammered Pakistan's Haris Rauf for a towering 107m six in the final over of their innings. Russell's six and 15 runs off the 20th over helped LAKR to a total of 165/6 against the San Francisco Unicorns, which they were unable to defend.\n\nThe video of the six went viral on social media, posted by the official account of Major League Cricket.\n\nWatch: Andre Russell's gigantic 107m six\n\nIn the third ball of the final over, the mighty Jamaican power-hitter heaved a pitched-up ball by Haris Rauf into the stands over the mid-wicket region, making it the longest six of MLC season two. Russell contributed an unbeaten 25-ball 40 to help LAKR to a fighting score.\n\nHowever, LAKR's total would not be enough, as the San Francisco Unicorns made mincemeat of the target and chased it down in just 15.2 overs.\n\nLAKR now stand on one win and two defeats after three games, having finished the previous season at the bottom of the table.\n\nAndre Russell has been in good form in 2024. Russell contributed heavily with both bat and ball as Kolkata Knight Riders won IPL 2024. He scored 222 runs and picked up 19 wickets, finishing as the joint fourth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament.\n\nHis turnout wasn't as great in the 2024 T20 World Cup on home soil, as West Indies crashed out in the Super 8 stage after winning all of their group games.\n\nHowever, Russell has put his T20 World Cup disappointment behind him, and reunited with Kolkata Knight Riders teammate Sunil Narine, who's captaining LAKR in MLC. LAKR's next match is against the San Francisco Unicorns again, on Sunday, July 14.",

    "body": "Now the Major League Cricket in the United States is in full swing. The Seattle Orcas, have registered their first win of the competition. Following the disappointment of the first game, when the team from Washington state went down tamely to MI New York, the Orcas, led by South Africa international Heinrich Klaasen came back strong to down the La Knight Riders by nine Wickets.\n\nIt was a measured performance by the Seattle Orcas. Having restricted the powerful La Knight Riders batting lineup to 168 for 5 in their 20 overs, the Orcas didn’t seem it necessary to rush their response. Having lost opener Nauman Anwar early, the team settled down to pace the innings, and to get to the target with as few risks as possible. Which is what they did.\n\nSeattle Orcas Restrict the La Knight Riders\n\nDespite losing their last game against the San Francisco Unicorns, the La Knight Riders are a force to be reckoned with. With top-class batters like David Miller, and Andre Russell in the lineup. And the Knight Riders got off to a decent start, posting 67 in 9.3 overs at the fall of the 2nd wicket. However, that is when the Seattle Orcas’ bowling attack put the screws on the La middle order.\n\nWith Cameron Gannon, Zaman Khan, and Imad Wasim locking down the opposition batsman and knocking a few off as well. Jason Roy was the top scorer for the La Knight Riders with 69 off 52 deliveries. With late impetus provided by David Miller who smashed 44 off 22 inclusive of two sixes. The trouble was this was not enough, especially given the batting of the opposition.\n\nOrcas Chase – The Ryan Rickelton Show\n\n169 was one of those scores in T20 cricket. A score that is not too imposing but not an easy one either. And a lot depends on how the top order of the chasing side pace themselves in going about it. For the Seattle Orcas, that man happened to be Ryan Rickelton. The 27-year-old South African native played a superb 103 off 66 inclusive of five sixes.\n\nThis meant that other players, Quinton de Kock to be exact, just had to hang around and provide support whilst Rickelton blasted the Knight Riders bowling to all corners. However, as the game neared its end, things became a bit tricky, as the Orcas got to the score with just one ball to spare. But a win is a win. However going forward, they would not like to cut it that fine. With the power-hitting that is at their disposal, finishing games off sooner rather than later should be the way forward for the Orcas.\n\nMajor League Cricket Table – No Clear Leaders At the Moment\n\nWhilst it is still early days for the season and the league as a whole-things are already shaping up pretty nicely, as the six major franchises battle it out for the top spot. With five of the six teams registering a win, with no result leaves the Texas Super Kings with no points. For cricket fans in America and elsewhere, if there were questions surrounding the quality of players and competitiveness of the cricket being played, games like this should put those doubts to rest.",
    "summary": "**Match Result:** Seattle Orcas won their first match of the tournament, defeating La Knight Riders by 9 wickets.\n\n**Key Performances:**\n\n* Ryan Rickelton of Seattle Orcas scored 103 off 66 balls, including 5 sixes, to lead his team's chase.\n* Jason Roy of La Knight Riders top-scored with 69 off 52 balls.\n* David Miller of La Knight Riders scored 44 off 22 balls, including 2 sixes.\n\n**Tournament Standings:** The league table is currently tight, with five out of six teams having registered a win.

Faf was not as aggressive as he was on the way to his century in the previous game against Washington Freedom but played second fiddle to his New Zealand partner's power-hitting.\n\nEventually scoring 34 off 17, du Plessis gave away a simple catch, but by then more than half of the total was chased down. Conway took a blow to his fingers and was forced to retire hurt after scoring 32 off 19, but Aaron Hardie took the game on his shoulders thereafter. His 34 off 23 balls effectively helped his team reach the target despite Hassan Khan's efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns found themselves in a bind on what was a slightly slow pitch. Their powerplay was strong, having scored 74 runs, but they also lost three wickets, losing their momentum because of this.\n\nAfter Finn Allen and Jake Fraser-McGurk were sent back to the pavilion courtesy of some brilliant bowling by Zia Ul-Haq, Matt Short continued the ante with a fighting 33. His wicket in the 6th over was a big blow, as the rest of the batting lineup faltered under the disciplined bowling of the Super Kings.\n\nMohammad Mohsin was the standout performer with the ball for the Super Kings, delivering a stellar spell that yielded figures of 4/13. His consistent line and length, coupled with his ability to extract some purchase from the pitch, made life difficult for the Unicorns' batters.\n\nBrief Scores: Texas Super Kings beat San Francisco Unicorns .",

Their decision proved fruitful as they managed to restrict the Unicorns to a modest 127 in 17.5 overs. The standout performer with the ball was Mohammad Mohsin, who claimed four wickets for just 13 runs in 3.5 overs, effectively dismantling the Unicorns' batting lineup.\n\nDwayne Bravo provided crucial support, taking 2 for 20, and ensuring the Unicorns' middle and lower order never settled. Matthew Short was the only bright spot for the Unicorns, scoring a quickfire 33 off 15 balls.\n\nIn response, the Super Kings' chase was clinical. Openers Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway set a blistering pace with a 61-run partnership in just 4.5 overs. Du Plessis, who scored 34 off 17 balls, and Conway, with 32 off 19, laid the foundation for a swift chase.\n\nAaron Hardie further stabilized the innings, contributing 34 off 23 balls, guiding the Super Kings to their target in just 12.5 overs with seven wickets in hand.\n\nThis victory not only lifted the Super Kings from the bottom of the standings but also showcased their potential to dominate the league. With this win, they now lead the points table, while the Unicorns, with two points from two games, find themselves in fifth place in the six-team competition.

    "body": "Right then, that is it from this exciting encounter between the Los Angeles Knight Riders and Seattle Orcas. However, the action doesn’t stop here and we will be back with more games from Major League Cricket 2024. The next game will be played between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings at Morrisville on 11th July, Thursday. The first ball will be bowled at 12.30 am IST (7.00 pm GMT the previous day) but our coverage will start much earlier. Until then, goodbye and cheers!\n\nRyan Rickelton is the Player of the Match for his scintillating knock of 103 runs in 66 deliveries. He says that he is just happy to be out there and contribute to the team. Adds that he was panicking when he got close to the ton and Quinton de Kock wasn't helping as well. Says that it is always fun to play with him and he is a phenomenal player. Mentions that the wicket was a bit sticky early on but it got better and that is why they chased. Further adds that it was a shocking run with which he completed the hundred, and they decided before that whatever happens, they would run and luckily Narine missed.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen, the captain of Seattle Orcas says that they executed the plan perfectly and credits Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton for their partnership. Mentions that they had to work on their mistakes in the previous game. Says that they have a quality group of local players and the experience of overseas players which makes his task a bit easier. Mentions that he was a bit nervous in the last over but he had faith in his batters.\n\nSunil Narine, the skipper of Los Angeles Knight Riders says that they had a decent start but they couldn't take wickets at regular intervals. Feels that they played a good game and mentions that another 15-20 runs on the board would help them. Says that the conditions are better for the team batting second and that has been the norm on this side of the world. Ends by saying they will adapt and bounce back strongly.\n\nEarlier in the innings, we saw that after a good start by the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the initial phases, they fell behind the eight-ball in the middle overs. A few good overs by the Orcas put them under pressure and that resulted in a few wickets as well. However, the show that David Miller put up in the last few overs helped the Knight Riders end their innings at 168 runs.\n\nWayne Parnell from the Seattle Orcas is up for a chat. He says that they bounced back very well after losing the first game. Adds that they bowled nicely and there were some good pieces of fielding as well, and then the brilliant partnership between Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton. Says that he has been unwell but is recovering well. Mentions that the communication between the two batters was important. Ends by saying that the bucket hat is a part of trying to grow cricket in the US.\n\nSpencer Johnson gave a strong start to the Los Angeles Knight Riders as he sent back Nauman Anwar early on in the innings. After that, things went downhill for them as they failed to get any breakthrough and allowed a big partnership to be formed. They managed to keep things quiet for a while but after 10 overs they had to face the onslaught of the batters. They made some errors in the field as well which might be discussed in the team meetings later on. They took the game till the last over but Ali Khan didn’t have much left to defend. They fought hard but fell short of the win.\n\nSeattle Orcas had a shaky start with the early dismissal of Nauman Anwar. However, a strong partnership between the South African pair of Ryan Rickelton and Quinton de Kock released the pressure. Ryan Rickelton took the aggressive approach initially while de Kock took his time to get used to the conditions and then unleashed his array of shots. They dominated after the halfway mark of the innings and attacked every bowler. The constant rotation of strike too kept the pressure on the opponents and allowed them to bat freely. Ryan Rickelton got to his maiden T20 century while Quinton de Kock scored a half-century to finish things in their favor.\n\nIt was another last-over finish in the Major League Cricket but the Seattle Orcas have taken home those two points. Thanks to the 152-run stand between Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton, they have managed to do it in style and earned themselves their first win of the season.\n\n0\n\nOvers19.3\n\nScore167 - 1\n\nAli Khan to Quinton de Kock, Overpitched and on off, Quinton de Kock drives it a bit too well as the ball zips to mid off, Ryan Rickelton wants the run but is sent back. 2 runs needed in 3 balls now!\n\n6\n\nOvers18.3\n\nScore164 - 1\n\nAndre Russell to Quinton de Kock, SIX! FIFTY FOR QDK! He says it's his turn now! Fuller and on middle, in the slot, Quinton de Kock clears his front leg away and tonks it over the bowler's head for a biggie.\n\n1\n\nOvers18.2\n\nScore158 - 1\n\nAndre Russell to Ryan Rickelton, HUNDRED FOR RICKELTON! What a feat for the young South African! A maiden T20 ton and he has waited for this for a long time after getting out in the 90s on a few occasions. This is full and around off, Ryan Rickelton drives it straight to extra covers and sets off for the run, Sunil Narine picks up and has a shy at the bowler's end but misses with Rickelton putting in a dive.\n\n1\n\nOvers17.6\n\nScore155 - 1\n\nSpencer Johnson to Quinton de Kock, Short of a length and around middle, Quinton de Kock goes for the pull but does not get the power as the ball goes wide of deep square leg for one more. Seattle Orcas need 14 runs to win in the last two overs!\n\n0\n\nOvers16.6\n\nScore147 - 1\n\nSunil Narine to Quinton de Kock, Flatter, short and on leg, Quinton de Kock backs away to cut but gets a bottom edge onto the ground as the ball bounces over the keeper and goes nowhere. Just one run off the over!\n\nStrategic Break! The Seattle Orcas are inches away from a victory courtesy of this partnership between Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton. Both these batters have shown intent and batted sensibly keeping the pressure on the opponents. Los Angeles Knight Riders, on the other hand, will need a few quick wickets to get back in the game. Their morale seems to have dropped as seen by their fielding in the last couple of overs.

They have multiple players who can change their fortunes and bounce back from that defeat. From the 2023 season, the team continues to benefit from Cameron Gannon's expertise; the pace bowler captured 11 wickets last season, earning him the title of the tournament's top domestic player. Heinrich Klaasen finished the 2023 MLC season as the runner-up in total runs scored, trailing only his South African teammate, Quinton de Kock, having amassed 235 runs for the Seattle Orcas.

Saurabh Netravalkar will play a crucial role in getting early wickets. He has been phenomenal in the recently concluded World Cup and would hope to keep the momentum going.\n\nBefore moving to the United States, Justin Dill was a prominent cricketer in South Africa.

With a handy total of only 127 needed for a win, openers Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway got off the blocks quickly, setting the tone for the innings.

His 34 off 23 balls effectively helped his team reach the target despite Hassan Khan's efforts.\n\nEarlier in the day, the San Francisco Unicorns found themselves in a bind on what was a slightly slow pitch. Their powerplay was strong, having scored 74 runs, but they also lost three wickets, losing their momentum because of this.\n\nAfter Finn Allen (10) and Jake Fraser-McGurk (11) were sent back to the pavilion courtesy of some brilliant bowling by Zia Ul-Haq, Matt Short continued the ante with a fighting 33.

Gambhir has already advocated for Abhishek Nayar and the former India all-rounder is almost certain to join the Indian team as an assistant coach, a role similar to the one he wants ten Doeschate for.\n\nIn a video shot at a KKR function during the IPL 2024, Gambhir said: \"When I talk about selflessness, I have never said this in 42 years of my career. And I wanted to say this. The greatest team man I ever played with, the most selfless human being, someone I can take a bullet for, someone who I can trust for life.\n\n\"I can tell you this because in 2011, my first game as a KKR captain, we only had four overseas (players) available. And this man had a fabulous 50-over World Cup. And we went in that game with only three overseas players. He was carrying drinks in that game with no disappointment on his face. He taught me selflessness. Ryan ten Doeschate (sic).\"\n\nIt’s not a secret that the BCCI prefer Indian coaches, so it will be interesting to see how they react to this demand of Gambhir who has requested a free hand in managing the team. The BCCI might not prefer having two assistant coaches for a national team. They could give Nayar the batting coach role and make ten Doeschate the assistant coach.\n\nT Dilip, who served as the fielding coach under outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid, is likely to be retained. As far as the bowling coach is concerned, the names of Lakshmipathy Balaji and Vinay Kumar have been doing the rounds, but it is believed that the BCCI is seeking a higher-profile candidate who would mentor and mould the upcoming crop of fast bowlers.\n\nGambhir and his support staff will take charge of the side from the Sri Lanka tour, consisting of three T20 Internationals (T20I) and as many One-Day Internationals (ODI), starting July 27.",

In that case, the Dutchman might be considered for a different role.\n\nEarlier, multiple reports suggested that Gautam Gambhir wants to bring along Abhishek Nayar as his assistant coach for the Indian team.\n\nNayar, who has represented India in three ODIs, currently serves as assistant coach at the Kolkata Knight Riders. He also holds the position of director at the KKR academy\n\nIf the BCCI secures the services of both Abhishek Nayar and Ryan ten Doeschate, it will leave a major void in KKR's coaching setup.\n\nGambhir, who replaced Rahul Dravid as India's head coach, will begin his stint with the white-ball tour of Sri Lanka later this month.",

    "body": "Known to be arguably the best six-hitter in T20 cricket, West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell made his way again with a magical 107-meter six. Representing the Los Angeles Knight Riders of MLC in the USA’s Major League Cricket, Russell launched Pakistan’s Haris Rauf for a towering six off his final over—the moment went viral on social media courtesy of MLC’s official account.\n\nThis was the case on the third ball of that climactic final over when the phenomenal Jamaican power hitter connected to a pitch-up delivery off Haris Rauf and smashed it well above the mid-wicket stands. This towered strike not only made it the longest six of MLC season two but added plausible runs to LAKR’s total.\n\nAn unbeaten 25-ball 40 by Andre Russell, which included this phenomenal six, saw his team get to a competitive 165/6 against San Francisco Unicorns. Despite his heroics, LAKR’s total went through.\n\nALSO READ: Jatin Paranjpe Shares Insights On Future Challenges For Gautam Gambhir\n\nThe target was hounded down with consummate ease by the San Francisco Unicorns in 15.2 overs, leaving LAKR with one win and two defeats after three games, which was a disappointing outcome for a team that finished at the bottom of the table last season.\n\nRussell has been phenomenal throughout 2024. He was behind Kolkata Knight Riders’ title win in IPL 2024 when he scored 222 runs and took 19 wickets to be the joint fourth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament. But he couldn’t really replicate that in the 2024 T20 World Cup at home – though the West Indies remained unbeaten during the group stage, they eventually got eliminated in the Super 8 phase.\n\nALSO READ: India’s Participation in 2025 ICC Champions Trophy In Doubt: Possible Shift To Sri Lanka or Dubai\n\nShaking off the disappointment of missing out on the World Cup, Russell linked up with his Kolkata Knight Riders colleague Sunil Narine, who captained LAKR in the MLC. With LAKR due to face the San Francisco Unicorns again on Sunday, July 14, form and experience will be everything as Russell looks to redeem his team and finally notch an important win.",

    "body": "When the first season of Major League Cricket came to a close, the Seattle Orcas showed their class. This year, the result was much different for the team of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSeattle fell in its final match of MLC 2 to the Texas Super Kings, losing by 37 runs.\n\nIt capped a horrid season for the green and gray, as the Orcas managed just two points and finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nSeattle is very South African heavy with its international players, who are coming off a world cup semifinal appearance. To say there were tired legs, would be stating the obvious. “Most of our pros came over straight from the world cup. Even if they won’t agree, they looked a little bit exhausted,” said Orcas All-Rounder Harmeet Singh.\n\nSome of the best South African cricketers have been playing without more than a week’s break for over four months.\n\nThis season just wasn’t to be for the Orcas. Like Seattle’s other bat-to-ball franchise, the Mariners, the Orcas could not put consistent runs on the board.\n\nOver the course of the seven games played this season, Seattle batted second in three of them and chased runs successfully in their lone victory. But when the Orcas were required to put up a high number, Seattle continuously dropped the ball.\n\nWhen opening with the batting, the Orcas have won just one game in their two years of existence. It was all the way back on July 15, 2023, in a win over San Fransisco. But since then, Seattle has lost seven in a row when opening with the paddle.\n\nDespite quite literally nothing bouncing the way of the Orcas in year two, in the final match there looked to be some positives. Ayan Desai made his MLC and Orcas debut taking the ball to start the first over.\n\nWith his first ball he took the wicket of a top-class cricketer in Devon Conway via leg before wicket. That ball was later named the play of the game and was the start of a great first match for Desai.\n\nHe finished with 2 wickets and 30 runs, and an economy of 7.50 which was the third lowest of all bowlers in the game.\n\nIt was just a bleak day with the bat for the Orcas after holding the Super Kings to a pretty manageable 177 after the first innings.\n\nSeattle knew it was going to have to work hard after its top run-scorer Ryan Rickleton was dismissed for a golden duck for the second straight match. Rickleton looked to be the bright spot of the Orca’s 2024 season scoring a century and spent a lot of time on the top of the run scoring table, but in his last two matches never saw a second ball.\n\nNo Orca scored more than 26 runs (Quentin de Kock 19 balls), which pales in comparison to the Super Kings’ three players who scored over 29 in the match.\n\nIt is a season to forget based on results for the Orcas, but MLC season 2 is a year to look back on as the sport of cricket continues to grow in the United States.",
    "summary": "The Seattle Orcas had a disappointing season in MLC 2, finishing at the bottom of the table with only 2 points. They lost their final match to the Texas Super Kings by 37 runs, capping off a poor season. The team, which has a heavy South African presence, struggled with tired international players who came straight from the World Cup. The Orcas struggled to score consistently, particularly when batting first, and failed to win a match when opening with the batting since July 15, 2023. In their final match, Ayan Desai made a promising debut, taking 2 wickets and scoring 30 runs, but the team's batting performance was poor, with no player scoring more than 26 runs. Despite the disappointing season, the article views MLC season 2 as a positive step forward for cricket in the United States.",

Although the result meant nothing in the grand scheme of things, Washington will hope for no psychological effects.\n\nLAST THREE: LWW\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: WANTING TO AT LEAST FINISH ON A HIGH\n\nTo beat Washington Freedom earlier in the week and extending their winning run will have served this San Francisco Unicorns squad with a huge injection of confidence ahead of this qualifier, knowing they have the ability to beat their opponents here.\n\nLAST THREE: WWW\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nOpeners Travis Head and Steve Smith have combined for a total of 385 runs over the course of this tournament, with Head blasting 194 and Smith 191. The latter is averaging over 60 and such numbers cannot be ignored from a betting point of view. Back Smith to score over 30+ runs and also back the pair to add over 26.5 runs for the first Washington wicket.\n\nWhilst he is known mainly for his batting, Rachin Ravindra also provides a very handy spin option for the Freedom. Figures of 4/16 against Texas Super Kings is testament to that and any hint of turn at Grand Prairie Stadium will be taken advantage of by the New Zealand international. Therefore, look at backing Ravindra with a small stake to finish as Washington’s top bowler.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nA lot could depend on San Francisco opener Finn Allen in the qualifier as he possesses the power required to tip things in the Unicorn’s favour whether they be setting or chasing a target. Allen’s 186 runs, including 15 sixes have been paramount to his side’s success, so backing Allen to continue his big-hitting exploits and gain over 0.5 match sixes here is worth a play on.\n\nAlso worthy of attention on the batting front is Sanjay Krishnamurthi on the back of his 79 from just 42 balls in the last contest between these two sides. Having performed so well against the same opponent so recently, Krishnamurthi knows what he needs to do to accumulate a significant score again vs Washington and backing him to gain 20+ runs via the ‘Battle Milestones’ market should be considered.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERTPREDICTION\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns may have gotten the better of Washington Freedom when the two teams last collided, but you can be sure that a different Freedom will be on show this time around, with significantly more at stake. The bowling especially should be far tighter on the Washington side and San Francisco will surely not find it as easy to score on this occasion.\n\nExpect Washington to bounce back strongly and whilst their batters should get on top of the Unicorns, this time the Freedom bowlers will likely show a marked improvement and help lead the league stage table toppers to victory.",
    "summary": "**Match Details**\n\n* The match is a qualifier for the final of the Major League Cricket tournament in 2024.\n* The teams playing are Washington Freedom (league winners) and San Francisco Unicorns (second-place finishers).\n* The match will take place on Thursday, July 25, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas, United States.\n\n**Team Forms**\n\n* Washington Freedom lost their last match against San Francisco Unicorns, ending their unbeaten record in the tournament.

    "date": "Tue Jul 23 09:46:26 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 is seeing a superb season for Australian cricketer Steve Smith, who was recently seen as the king of cricket grounds. Smith has not had a place in the Australian T20I team but showed his prowess with the bat again and became the talk of the town on Monday, July 22. Washington Freedom’s team leader provided bowling skills at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas against the San Francisco Unicorns, proving his unerring style even in the modern mode of the game.\n\nThe test specialist Steve Smith gave a rude reminder of that by cutting loose against the bowlers for 56 of 31 balls. He also set five boundaries and four maximums, two of which were stunning and caught the attention of MLC’s social media team. That flexibility alone was on display in the dressing-room speech, reminding everyone why he is widely considered one of cricket’s premier players of all time.\n\nGreat Figures in MLC 2024\n\nSince the start of the season, Steve Smith has proved to be one of the best players for the Washington Freedom. He has 247 runs to his credit in the seven games and has scored an average of 61.75. with a magnificent strike rate of 144.44. These figures put him in the position of the principal run-maker in the competition, a position next to Faf du Plessis, who has amassed 264 runs, and his teammate Travis Head, who has scored 250 runs.\n\nSmith and his valuable properties have played a significant role in the Washington Freedom’s campaign to attain and maintain a solid standing in leagues.\n\nThe Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns will face each other once more on Friday in the first semifinal of the tournament. Both teams qualified for the playoffs with five equal wins; therefore, the following match was expected. Even with the six-wicket loss to San Francisco in the recent match that adopted the DLS method in Washington’s first match defeat of the season, the side is fully optimistic, and Smith has a lot of trust in them.\n\nSteve Smith’s Journey and Revival in MLC\n\nWhat is perhaps even more powerful is that this journey in MLC 2024 has been told through the story of Smith. He has experienced some misfortune in the international T20 chase, and then this spec allows him to reintroduce himself. This characteristic has been a boost to Washington Freedom because he can stabilize the innings and yet be very aggressive when the game calls for it. This season, Steve Smith has not only shown good technique but also the good strategies that you expect from a captain and a leader of the team.\n\nHowever, a noteworthy aspect of Steve Smith is his captaincy for the Washington Freedom, besides the batting. This is because he has been around, and he is the one who uses his maturity in dealing with the team when it is steamed up. The young players within the team have thus greatly benefited from him, and Washington has become one of the most balanced and charged teams in the tournament.\n\nEverybody will focus on the performance of Steve Smith in Major League Cricket 2024 as the competition goes on. His comeback to T20 cricket is a sign of versatility and the ambition of the player seeking to be the best. Looking at the coming rounds of matches and the knockout stages, especially, Steve Smith and his ability to lead the team will be very vital to the success of the Washington Freedom.\n\nIn any case, the MLC 2024 season alone is more than enough to establish Steve Smith as the most prominent cricketer of the current and perhaps future generations, thereby expressing that class and quality in the cricket field do not have an expiration date at the international level.",
    "summary": "* Australian cricketer Steve Smith is having a great season in MLC 2024, showcasing his batting prowess and captaincy skills for the Washington Freedom team.\n* In a recent match against the San Francisco Unicorns, Smith scored 56 runs off 31 balls, with 5 boundaries and 4 maximums, displaying his flexibility and unerring style in the modern mode of the game.\n* Smith has been one of the top performers in MLC 2024, with 247 runs in 7 games at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 144.44, making him one of the principal run-makers in the competition.\n* He has played a significant role in the Washington Freedom's campaign, helping the team maintain a solid standing in the league.\n* The Washington Freedom will face the San Francisco Unicorns again in the first semifinal of the tournament on Friday, and Smith is optimistic about his team's chances despite a recent loss.\n* Smith's journey in MLC 2024 is a story of revival, as he has experienced misfortune in international T20 cricket, but is now reintroducing himself as a force to be reckoned with.\n* His captaincy skills have also been instrumental in the team's success, and his maturity and experience have benefited the young players in the team.",

I personally feel they could be assistant coaches, who can involve themselves more in all three departments rather than just one. That’s the reason we now have two assistant coaches. As I said, we still have one month after the Sri Lanka tour. We will try and finalise after the Sri Lanka tour,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Cricbuzz reports, former South Africa international, Morne Morkel, who has also been a part of KKR in the past, is a heavy favourite to be included in India's coaching setup as the bowling coach.

    "body": "While all the cricketers and the support staff members flew together from Mumbai, ten Doeschate, who was in the US as part of the support staff at the LA Knight Riders in the Major League Cricket, flew directly to Colombo and then joined the Indian squad in Pallekele on Thursday (July 25).\n\nThe first India vs Sri Lanka T20I will be played on Saturday (July 27).\n\nNayar and Ten Doeschate have long associations with Gambhir. All three were part of the Kolkata Knight Riders coaching staff in IPL 2024. Gambhir was the mentor, Nayar the assistant coach, and Ten Doeschate was designated as the team's fielding coach. The former Netherlands star, in fact, played five seasons under Gambhir's captaincy in KKR. Between 2011 and 2015, ten Doeschate featured in 41 matches for KKR. He was inducted into the three-time champions' support staff even before Gambhir came on board for the last season.\n\nThis is the first time the Indian cricket setup is seeing two assistant coaches. Notably, there was no such post during Anil Kumble, Ravi Shastri or Rahul Dravid's tenures. There was a batting coach, a bowling coach, a fielding coach and other support staff members comprising throwdown specialists, physios, analysts and others.\n\nThings are slightly different in Gambhir's tenure, at least as things stand now. He has appointed two assistant coaches in Nayar and ten Doeschate. There are no mentions of a batting coach. T Dilip, Inda's fielding coach during Dravid's tenure, has got an extension. Regarding the bowling coach, NCA coach Sairaj Bahutule is in Sri Lanka as a stop-gap arrangement. There are reports of Gambhir showing interest in getting former South Africa pacer Morne Morkel, another old associate of the former India opener, on board.\n\nThere are no official announcements from the BCCI regarding Gambhir's support staff, but it will likely come after the Sri Lanka tour.\n\nGambhir eager to work with Nayar and ten Doeschate\n\n“Really happy with the BCCI. They have agreed to most of the things I have asked for. I was really surprised when I was reading all the news. Abhishek, as assistant coach, Ryan, as assistant coach. I feel there could be assistant coaches working and focussing on all three departments rather than one specific department. That's the reason we now have two assistant coaches. That's the way we will go forward as well. Yes, we will get to know the exact support staff after the Sri Lanka tour,” Gambhir said.\n\nGambhir spoke about his experience of working with Nayar and Ten Doeschate in KKR earlier this season when the franchise lifted their third IPL title. “This is going to be the crux of the support staff. As I said, we still have one month after the Sri Lanka tour. We will try and finalise after the Sri Lanka tour. But, I have worked with people like Abhishek Nayar, Ryan ten Doeschate very closely. In the last two months, especially in the IPL, I have enjoyed working with them. They are thorough professionals. Hope Ryan and Abhishek can have a successful stint. Hopefully, we can have a successful tenure as coaches. I am really looking forward to work with the rest of the other guys as well. I have had some really good feedback from the players about the other guys. I am really looking forward to working with them,” he said.",

Led by Faf du Plessis' quickfire fifty, the fastest by a batter this season, the Texas Super Kings had a strong start to their run-chase.\n\nAlso Read | QPR vs Tottenham Hotspur, Club Friendly 2024 Live Streaming Online in India: How To Watch Pre-Season Football Match Live Telecast on TV & Football Score Updates in IST?.\n\nThe Proteas opener propelled his team to 76 runs in the powerplay. However, Washington's bowlers executed a brilliant comeback in the middle overs. Jasdeep Singh, Glenn Maxwell, and Ravindra shared the 10 wickets among them, but it was Lockie Ferguson's crucial over to Du Plessis after the powerplay that turned the tide. Lockie conceded only 2 wides in that over, eventually leading to Faf's dismissal.\n\nSoon after, the Super Kings' batting lineup crumbled, losing 4 wickets for just 15 runs between overs 7.1 and 11.6, ultimately costing them the match. While Calvin Savage managed to strike a few powerful blows towards the end, it only served to narrow the margin of defeat.\n\nAlso Read | Rangers vs Manchester United, Club Friendly 2024 Live Streaming Online in India: How To Watch Pre-Season Football Match Live Telecast on TV & Football Score Updates in IST?.\n\nEarlier, Washington Freedom posted a formidable target of 206 for the Texas Super Kings. The fireworks began early, with Travis Head delivering a scintillating performance in the powerplay. He hammered 53 runs off just 22 balls, dismantling the seamers with ease and giving Washington a flying start.\n\nAs spin was introduced, the scoring rate slowed slightly, thanks to some purchase on the used pitch. However, Maxwell played a pivotal role in maintaining the momentum, contributing crucial runs in the middle overs. Towards the tail end of the innings, Pienaar provided a valuable boost, ensuring a strong finish for the team.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Smith (57) also continued his consistent performances, nearly batting through the entire innings and securing a well-earned fifty. His steady presence at the crease anchored the Washington innings and kept the scoreboard ticking.\n\nThe start given by the two Australian batters was more than enough for the middle order of the Washington-based side to take on the rest of the bowlers. Maxwell (34) and Obus Pienaar (33) both scored crucial runs to ensure their team put up a tough target that the Texas Super Kings were eventually unable to chase down.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom 206/5 (Steve Smith 57, Travis Head 53, Noor Ahmad 3/38) vs Texas Super Kings 164 (Faf du Plessis 55, Calvin Savage 35, Rachin Ravindra 4/16).

    "body": "26 Jul, 9.39am After all those thrilling finishes in the Major League Cricket 2024, we are now down to the last two games to find out who will lift the title this time. Washington Freedom has already sealed a spot in the Final after winning the Qualifier against San Francisco Unicorns. The challenger though will be played between the winner of Eliminator, Texas Super Kings and the loser of the Qualifier, San Francisco Unicorns at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. Both sides faced each other earlier in the tournament and it was Texas Super Kings who won that contest by 7 wickets. The contest between the Texas Super Kings and San Francisco Unicorns has every ingredient of being a cagey contest with both sides depending on their top order while the bowling is their mainstay. The skipper of Texas Super Kings, Faf du Plessis has led them from the front and sits on top of the run-getters chart and his partner Devon Conway also features in the top 5 run-getters of this edition. The worrying part for the Texas Super Kings is they rely heavily on their top order and the likes of Marcus Stoinis, Aaron Hardie, and the rest of the batting order are yet to deliver when it matters the most. The bowling has done well and the likes of Noor Ahmad, Zia-ul-Haq, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, and Marcus Stoinis have combined well to create a perfect mix of spin and pace. Their opponents on the other hand, San Francisco Unicorns do bat heavy at the top but do possess threatening batters in the middle order as well. Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, and Sanjay Krishnamurthi form an explosive top three while players such as Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford comprise a solid middle order. The bowling looks balanced too with Pat Cummins leading the bowling attack along with Haris Rauf, Carmi le Roux, and Juanoy Drysdale while Hassan Khan will look to trap the opposition batters with his left-arm spinners. With two sides equally capable of dismantling their opponents, this promises to be no less than a thriller.",

Hassan Khan was the pick of the batters for SFU scoring 57 off 36 balls.\n\nIn reply, Head top-scored in the match with an unbeaten 77 off just 44 balls, his highest score this season, as we raced to 149/3 with 27 balls to spare. The Aussie opener hit 10 fours and three sixes during his knock, his fifth consecutive fifty in MLC 2024.\n\nGlenn Maxwell also smashed 54 off just 23 balls to take us into our first final of the MLC. He smashed five sixes and four boundaries to complete a comprehensive win for us.\n\nBowling first, Jansen struck with the third ball of the innings to dismiss Finn Allen, caught safely by wicketkeeper Andries Gous. Saurabh Netravalkar was right on the money as ever, sending back Jake Fraser-McGurk after constantly frustrating him with dot balls. Jansen picked up another wicket off the last ball of the powerplay as SFU slid to 49/3. The spin pair of Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell kept things tight as only 26 runs came in the next six overs with SFU losing two more wickets.\n\nAfter attaining some stability, the SFU innings suffered once again as Jansen accounted for Anderson to get his third dismissal of the night. The last five wickets fell for just 18 runs as they closed out in 145.\n\nChasing 146, Travis Head carted three sixes and two fours off Carmi le Roux as we got past the fifty-run mark at the end of the powerplay.\n\nHead coasted to his half-century off just 28 balls in the 10th over as Maxwell shifted gears soon after with back-to-back sixes off Hassan. Maxwell put on a show as he took apart the SFU bowling attack with his power and panache reaching his fifty in only 22 balls. The Aussie scored 46 of his total runs in boundaries.\n\nMaxwell and Head added an unbroken 85 runs in just 40 balls for the fourth wicket to make light work of the chase. Maxwell looked in a hurry as he closed the match in style with a four off pacer Haris Rauf. Hassan Khan picked up two wickets for the SFU.\n\nWith the win, we proceed to the final of MLC 2024 to be played at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Sunday.\n\nWashington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns MLC 2024 brief scores: SFU 145/10 in 19 overs (Hassan Khan 57, Corey Anderson 26, Rachin Ravindra 4/11, Marco Jansen 3/46) vs WF 149/3 in 15.3 overs (Travis Head 77*, Glenn Maxwell 54*, Hassan Khan 2/32).\n\nWashington Freedom won by seven wickets.",

The Texas Super Kings’ bowlers, including Ottneil Bartmann, Noor Ahmad, and Calvin Savage, played a crucial role in dismantling the Seattle batting lineup.\n\nSeattle Orcas’ Run Chase\n\nSeattle Orcas began their chase with a setback as Ryan Rickleton was dismissed for a duck on the first ball.

    "body": "Dallas-Fort Worth continues to expand its sports landscape and the state of Texas took a front row seat with the launch of Cognizant Major League Cricket in the United States in 2023.\n\nTexas Super Kings, the Major League Cricket franchise based in Texas, is headlined by veteran South African and Top Order Batter Faf du Plessis, who returns for his second season. He will be joined by wicket-keeper Devon Conway, Australian power-hitter Marcus Stoinis, fast-bowler Naveen Ul Haq, and Team USA’s Milind Kumar.\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) is the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States, which began in 2023. Exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, MLC showcases superstar players from around the globe, bringing world-class T20 cricket to America.\n\nAs the 2024 season is underway, here’s some quick facts on MLC and what you can expect from T20 Cricket:\n\nWhere are the matches played?\n\nMatches will take place at Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina. The full schedule and available tickets can be viewed here.\n\nWho are the teams?\n\nThere’s six teams currently in the MLC, representing different cities and regions within the United States - The Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom.\n\nWho won last year?\n\nMI New York claimed victory in the inaugural 2023 MLC season, defeating the Seattle Orcas.\n\nWhat is T20 Cricket?\n\nT20, or Twenty20 is one format of cricket.\n\nIt is a shortened format (around 3 hours) where each team has 20 overs (this includes 120 balls) to score the most runs.\n\nIt’s known for its explosive batting as the time constraints means more incentive to hit big “sixes” and take risks. (Sixes are similar to homeruns for all the baseball fans out there).\n\nAn 'over' is the name given to six consecutive balls bowled by one ‘bowler’. There are 20 of these overs in an ‘inning’.There are two innings in a game.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nEach team has 11 batsmen that will attempt to score more runs (points) than their opponent.\n\nThe fielding side will be trying to get all the batsmen out as soon as possible to keep the runs total low.\n\nA team earns one run when a batsman hits the ball and runs from one set of stumps to the other.\n\nTeams earn four runs for hitting the ball out of bounds and six runs for hitting the ball out of bounds without it hitting the ground.\n\nThe bowler is the player who throws the ball at the stumps to try to knock the ‘bails’ off. (The bowlers are the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball).\n\nWickets/stumps are the three vertical sticks with two smaller ones called bails laid horizontally on top. The goal is to knock the bails off.\n\nA player on the fielding team stands behind the stumps to catch the ball.\n\nThe white lines on the ground is the crease, this is where the wickets and batsman should be.\n\nWhat has MLC done for Cricket in the USA?\n\nMLC has revolutionized the cricket landscape in the USA. Cognizant Major League Cricket was recently awarded List-A status, recognized by the ICC as an official T20 league, making it America’s first world-class domestic tournament. The inaugural 2023 season was a huge success, with sold-out matches garnering millions of viewers worldwide. The recent T20 World Cup was played across the USA and West Indies and saw team USA both co-host and participate in the tournament for the first time. Forty-seven of the players who took part in the World Cup will remain in the USA for MLC.\n\nMLC FAMILY DAYS - SUNDAY SPECIAL\n\nMake your next family outing one to remember.

    "body": "During the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) clash between the Los Angeles Travis HeadKnight Riders (LAKR) and Washington Freedom (WSF) at Morrisville on Sunday, July 14, a humorous incident unfolded with Travis Head.\n\nThe left-hander was taken aback when his bat broke and unexpectedly flew out of his grip while attempting a pull shot against a brisk short-of-length delivery from West Indian all-rounder Andre Russell. As the ball headed towards mid-on, Head’s bat veered towards the square leg umpire, leaving the Aussie opener visibly astonished.\n\nAfter that incident, Head quickly found his form, smashing a superb 54 off just 32 balls, including two fours and six sixes. In pursuit of a modest 130 for victory, the 30-year-old ensured WSF encountered no difficulties, wrapping up the chase in just 16 overs with eight wickets in hand. Head received strong support from captain Steve Smith, who remained unbeaten on 42 off 36 balls.\n\nThis marked Head’s maiden half-century in the tournament, bringing his total runs to 87 in four matches at an average of 29 and a striking rate exceeding 164.\n\nThe victory ensured WSF’s undefeated streak continued, securing their third win in three completed matches, alongside one No Result. Leading comfortably with 7 points from 4 matches and three games remaining, WSF are well positioned for a top-four finish and advancement to the playoffs.\n\nWSF’s stellar bowling preceded Travis Head’s exploits\n\nTravis Head’s half-century stood out in WSF’s chase, following a dominant bowling performance in the first innings. Opting to field after winning the toss, WSF restricted LAKR to just 129 runs in 18.4 overs.\n\nUSA’s Saurabh Netravalkar, continuing his impressive form from the 2024 T20 World Cup, recorded exceptional figures of 4/35 in 3.4 overs. He was well-supported by Glenn Maxwell (3/15) and Lockie Ferguson (2/31), keeping LAKR’s batsmen under constant pressure.\n\nThis defeat marked LAKR’s third loss in four completed matches, placing them second from the bottom with three points from five games. They face a crucial match against the Seattle Orcas on Wednesday, July 17.\n\nMeanwhile, WSF will aim to maintain their unbeaten streak when they meet MI New York (MINY) on Tuesday, July 16.",

Saif Badar scored 35 off 28 balls for the Knight Riders.\n\nIn response, we reached 130/2 in 16 overs with Travis Head top-scoring in the contest with 54 off just 32 balls. The southpaw’s first fifty in MLC was laden with six sixes and two fours. Our skipper Steve Smith hit two sixes and two fours to remain unbeaten on 42 off 36 balls.\n\nOpting to bowl first, Netravalkar struck with his first ball of the day to beat LAKR Skipper Sunil Narine for a duck. The left-arm pacer made his first over even more memorable with the wicket of Unmukt Chand off the last ball.\n\nSmith introduced spinner Maxwell in the third over. The off-spinner reaped immediate reward going through the gate of Shakib Al Hasan as LAKR were three down with the score reading just 13. Soon it became 18/4 with Lockie Ferguson also getting into the act to clean up Jason Roy.\n\nMaxwell returned to pick up two more wickets including the big-hitting Andre Russell, who was dismissed for 20. Netravalkar polished off the tail to end with four wickets as the LAKR innings folded up for 129. Meanwhile, Ferguson also chipped in with 2/31 in four overs.\n\nChasing a modest target, Smith and Head gave us a flying start racing to 61 at the end of the powerplay. Head was particularly severe smashing sixes off all four bowlers introduced in the first six overs as 44 runs came from boundaries during the period.\n\nHead brought up his fifty, off just 27 balls, in style with a huge six down the ground as the Australian duo added 79 for the opening wicket, the highest partnership for us, for any wicket in the history of MLC.\n\nSmith took charge once Head departed and remained unbeaten to see us through with four overs to spare. Smith jumped to second in the overall batting charts of MLC 2024 with 126 runs at an unbelievable average of 126.00 and a strike rate of 140.00.\n\nAfter yet another victory, we continue on top of the MLC 2024 points table with seven points from four matches.\n\nWe are up against MI New York in our next match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Tuesday.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders vs Washington Freedom MLC 2024 brief scores: LAKR 129/10 in 18.4 overs (Saif Badar 35, Andre Russell 20, Saurabh Netravalkar 4/35, Glenn Maxwell 3/15) vs WF 130/2 in 16 overs (Travis Head 54, Steve Smith 42, Shadley van Schalkwyk 1/17, Spencer Johnson 1/33).\n\nWashington Freedom won by eight wickets.",

MI New York and Seattle Orcas launched the latest edition on Friday in a rematch of last year's final.\n\nAs I reported, the MLC's historic first season exceeded financial targets with revenues of $8 million, but its launch was undoubtedly helped by the novelty factor after previous attempts by administrators to strike gold in America failed.\n\nForbesAmerica's Major League Cricket Debut Surpassed Expectations On And Off The Field\n\n\"Could have been some element of that (novelty factor), but I think this fanbase is looking for high quality cricket on the field,\" MLC chief executive Vijay Srinivasan told me.\n\n\"We want to make sure of the standards befitting American professional sports and I think we delivered that (last season) and were recognized in the world of cricket.\"\n\nMLC has been able to secure major sponsorship deals, highlighted by Cognizant - a multinational information technology services and consulting company - becoming its first title sponsor.\n\n\"We are growing. We definitely have been very successful in sponsorship sales and certainly we want to deliver and show value,\" Srinivasan said.\n\nAs I reported previously, salary caps for teams are to remain the same, but top players will still be handsomely remunerated and earn around $175,000 for a minimum of five games - rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nWhile Indian players are not allowed to play outside of the IPL, a slew of stars will play in this season's MLC - many from Australia highlighted by San Francisco's marquee signing of Pat Cummins to a four-year deal.\n\nAhead of this season, MLC received official T20 league status with tournament playing records counted towards format statistics.\n\n\"The goal is to be competitive (financially) with the top leagues and there will be adjustment that happens as we grow,\" Srinivasan said. \"That's (salary caps) something we'll have to review every season.\n\n\"We've got some really strong names coming here. Ultimately, the teams and the players are what defines the product.\"\n\nWhile things are looking rosy in American cricket, there has been familiar warring behind the scenes with governing body USA Cricket amid continual turmoil after a spate of resignations and chief executive Dr. Noor Murad having his contract terminated earlier this year.\n\nAs I reported in April, USA Cricket avoided calls for suspension, but its funding is being 'controlled' by the sport's governing body. The situation is likely to be a talking point at the International Cricket Council's upcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\nForbes'Controlled Funding' Put In Place For USA Cricket Ahead Of Home T20 World Cup\n\nUSA Cricket sanctions MLC, which is administered by American Cricket Enterprises after signing a 50-year commercial rights agreement in 2019.\n\n\"Governance is always a challenge, but it needs to sort itself out,\" Srinivasan, a co-founder of ACE, said. \"We are certainly hopeful that things will stabilize.\"\n\nThere are plans to expand MLC, with Chicago and Atlanta touted as possible new franchises amid a longer tournament earmarked to be played over much of June and July moving forward.\n\nBut, right now, MLC is hoping to continue the trajectory of the British bat and ball sport with deep roots in a cricket backwater. While figures have varied, with the sport's governing body having claimed that there are 50 million cricket fans in the U.S., there is already an invested fanbase for MLC.\n\n\"Willow (cricket broadcaster into North America) goes into around four-five million homes, so that probably translates to a fanbase of something in the range of 10 million people,\" Srinivasan said.\n\n\"There's a lot of interest and excitement in MLC after the T20 World Cup. I think we can ride that momentum.\"",
    "summary": "**Season 2 of MLC**: The second season of MLC has kicked off with a rematch between MI New York and Seattle Orcas, following a successful first season that exceeded financial targets with revenues of $8 million.\n\n**Expanding Reach**: The tournament has secured major sponsorship deals, including a title sponsorship with Cognizant, and has received official T20 league status, with tournament playing records counted towards format statistics.\n\n**Player Contracts**: Top players will earn around $175,000 for a minimum of five games, rivaling figures in other T20 leagues outside of the Indian Premier League. Stars from Australia, including Pat Cummins, will participate in this season's MLC.\n\n**Future Plans**: There are plans to expand MLC, with Chicago and Atlanta touted as possible new franchises, and a longer tournament earmarked to be played over much of June and July in the future.\n\n**Challenges**: Despite the progress, MLC faces challenges, including governance issues with USA Cricket, the sport's governing body in the US.\n\n**Fanbase**: MLC has an invested fanbase, with cricket broadcaster Willow reaching around 4-5 million homes, translating to a fanbase of around 10 million people. The tournament hopes to ride the momentum generated by the recent T20 World Cup.",

    "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 season commenced on Friday as MI New York began their title defence with a commanding six-wicket win over Seattle Orcas at the Church Street Park Stadium. All eyes were on Nicholas Pooran at Church Street Park in Morrisville as the West Indian wicketkeeper-batter continued his form from the 2023 edition. His unbeaten 62 off just 37 balls helped MI New York chase down a total of 109 runs in just 14.2 overs.\n\nWith the early wickets of Ruben Clinton (6) and USA's national team skipper Monank Patel (8), the initial momentum seemed to be in the Seattle Orcas' favour. Cameron Gannon was the main bowling aggressor, getting both batters in the third over and giving his team a ray of hope.\n\nBut then, Pooran proceeded to hit Gannon for two sixes and as many fours in his next over. This turned the tide in MI New York's favour.\n\nEventually, Pooran's power-hitting abilities proved to be too much for the Seattle Orcas. They got the wickets of Shayan Jahangir (3) and Tim David (12) as well, but the left-handed Pooran and his countryman Kieron Pollard (8*) took their team over the line for their first win of MLC 2024.\n\nEarlier in the day, the skills of the MI New York bowlers were on display as they bowled out the Seattle Orcas for just 108 runs. Rashid Khan and Trent Boult bagged three wickets each, never really allowing their opponents to settle into the match.\n\nNew Zealand's star pacer Boult got the early breakthrough in the opening over itself, sending Nauman Anwar back to the pavilion for a duck. The Pakistan batter's late attempt to cut the ball away caught a faint edge which travelled to the wicketkeeper and eventual match-winner Pooran.\n\nWith Quinton de Kock (5) still at the crease, the Seattle Orcas could still hit a competitive score, but he was also removed by Boult in the next over. His attempt to hit the ball through the leg side was met with a top edge, and Pooran did well to get underneath it and send de Kock back to the pavilion.\n\nFrom then on, MI New York were in the driving seat, getting the regular wickets. For the Seattle Orcas, Shubham Ranjane ended as the highest run-getter with a tidy innings of 35 runs in 31 balls. Finding the boundary regularly, Ranjane proved to be a threat before he tried to hit Rashid Khan for consecutive sixes but fell short in his second attempt, hitting the ball to Tim David instead.\n\nHarmeet Singh, who recently featured for the USA in the T20 World Cup, played a 20-run cameo as the side set a target that was eventually chased down by the defending champions with 34 balls to spare.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

They have a seriously strong side all-round with the likes of Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen, Rachin Ravindra, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andries Gous and Lockie Ferguson in their squad.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWW\n\nMI NEW YORK FORM: WINNING MACHINE\n\nMI New York cruised to an opening game victory against the team that they defeated in the final, the Seattle Orcas, after they skittled the Orcas for 108 in 19.1 overs yesterday. They gave teams a head start after a poor beginning to the 2023 campaign before clicking and they appear to have clicked almost immediately this time around.\n\nLAST THREE: WWWL\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Washington Freedom have an excellent side throughout but the one man, of the many, that they will rely upon for quick runs at the top of the order will be the ever impressive and still improving Travis Head. Backing the Aussie T20 opener and potential future captain to be their best bat in this one looks a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, MI New York lost both of their openers, Ruben Clifton and Monank Patel, to the change up right arm medium bowling of Cameron Gannon. That will leave Andrew Tye licking his lips and Tye to take two or more wickets is something worth having a look at here.\n\nMI NEW YORK BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nLast season, the excellence of West Indian Nicholas Pooran saw him become the tournament’s top run scorer and he got off to another strong start the other night in what proved to be a match-winning knock in a small chase. Backing Pooran to continue his fine form is always fairly safe and him scoring 30 or more seems a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, MI New York ripped through the Orcas’ top order in the powerplay with the excellent Trent Boult taking 3-25 in the end off his four overs. Rashid Khan’s spin also claimed three wickets and that is a known weakness of Head so Khan or Boult taking two or more wickets appears a more than reasonable bet.\n\nWASHINGTON FREEDOM VS MI NEW YORK EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nNow then, this one might actually be tough to call. Whilst MI New York began with a comfortable victory in their opening game and they are the defending champions of this competition, the Washington Freedom have real star names of the T20 circuit littered throughout their side and will be captained by an excellent tactician in Steve Smith. One bet that seems a decent shout, though, is for Pooran to continue his good form and even top sore in the match, once again.",

Captained by Corey Anderson, there is plenty of experience in the Unicorns’ side such as Pat Cummins, Matt Henry and Liam Plunkett but the star attraction is likely to be West Indian all-rounder Sherfane Rutherford.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: A TERRIBLE FIRST SEASON\n\nIn contrast to the Unicorns’ narrow miss on the top four last season, the Los Angeles Knight Riders, affiliated with Indian Premier League side the Kolkata Knight Riders, endured a miserable campaign last season. LAKR began with four defeats, and all four defeats were fairly heavy, before finishing the season, in last place, with a slender two-wicket defeat against league winners Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLLL\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe biggest weakness in a weak LAKR side would be their bowling department so San Francisco Unicorns to score big runs would appear quite likely. There aren’t too many standout candidates for that role, though, with emphasis on their own bowling but one man who will be key to any success is likely to be Jake Fraser-McGurk, set to be a leading light of Australia’s next white-ball era. Fraser-McGurk to start his newest franchise journey off well as their top scorer in this match would be worth a shot.\n\nIn the bowling attack, T20 has arguably been Pat Cummins’ weakest format but the Australian Test captain took hat-tricks in successive matches at the World Cup so will come into this feeling a bit of form. Cummins to begin his campaign with two or more wickets seems a good bet.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nAs mentioned, LAKR’s weakness is probably with the ball but with the bat they are not too much stronger, at least on paper. Former England international Jason Roy is likely to be in the top three but it will be middle-order hitting they rely on and, in particular, David Miller who is likeliest to be their best batter in most matches.\n\nWith the ball, though, they will believe that some skilful bowling will be able to hurt what is not the most star-studded Unicorns lineup. That is where the excellent spin of Adam Zampa comes into play and the Australian international to take two or more wickets seems a good bet.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS VS LOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThese two were the weakest teams in the competition last season but both sides will be hoping to be a little rejuvenated this time around. There is one clear ‘top tip’ to offer here, though. The Unicorns’ strength is in their pace-bowling attack, whilst LAKR look quite weak at the top of the order. Naturally, then, if the Unicorns open up with seam, LAKR may well struggle and that should result in the San Francisco Unicorns having the better of the powerplay and the higher opening stand.",

    "body": "The teams, the format, the big names, and everything else you might have been wondering about\n\nAbhimanyu Bose\n\n05-Jul-2024 • 20 hrs ago\n\nDid you think the cricket fever would die in the USA after the T20 World Cup? Think again, because the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) is upon us. The first edition had high scores and thrilling individual performances as some of the biggest names in T20 cricket showcased their talent in Texas and North Carolina. So what's in store for us this year? Find all your answers here.\n\nFirst things first. When does it start?\n\nThe first match is on Friday, July 5, with MI New York taking on Seattle Orcas in Morrisville. The tournament will go on till July 28. There will be a total of 25 matches.\n\nSo who are the teams participating? And who won it the first time around?\n\nThe six teams are Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom.\n\nIt was MI New York, inspired by a whirlwind Nicholas Pooran century, who beat Seattle Orcas in the final to win the inaugural title.\n\nAre you sure it's the MLC and not the IPL? There seem to be a lot of familiar names...\n\nThat's because IPL franchises have invested in most of the teams in the tournament, as they have in other franchise leagues like SA20, ILT20 and the CPL. IPL franchises own four teams in the MLC. Apart from the three obvious ones, Seattle Orcas are owned by the GMR Group, who co-own Delhi Capitals.\n\nWashington Freedom, owned by Indian-American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil, have Cricket New South Wales as their high-performance partner. San Francisco Unicorns, owned by Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, have a partnership with Cricket Victoria.\n\nWe saw games in New York and Lauderhill in the T20 World Cup, apart from Dallas. Will the MLC also be played in those grounds?\n\nNo. This year's MLC, like in 2023, will only be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina's Morrisville.\n\nLast season, the first eight league games were played in Dallas and the next seven in Morrisville, before the tournament shifted back to Dallas for the knockout rounds. This year, however, both stadiums will host games throughout the season.\n\nSo you said Pooran played the last season. Who are some other big names that were there last season and will play this year as well?\n\nA total of 23 overseas players who turned out in the inaugural season will be in action in MLC 2024 as well. Among them, some of the big names include Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Heinrich Klaasen and Kieron Pollard.\n\nAfghanistan's left-arm wristspinner Noor Ahmad will replace Daryl Mitchell - who has been ruled out by an injury and is currently doing rehab in New Zealand - for Texas Super Kings. You can find the full list of retained overseas players here.\n\nAnd any exciting new additions this year?\n\nYes indeed. Pat Cummins, Travis Head and Steven Smith are some high-profile Australian signings, while Daryl Mitchell, Shakib Al Hasan and Romario Shepherd are some of the other new signings. You can see the full squads here.\n\nUSA pulled off a surprise and made it to the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup. So who will their local heroes line up for?\n\nUSA did have an impressive showing at the T20 World Cup, with a Super Over win over Pakistan the highlight. Their captain Monank Patel, Noshthush Kenjige and Shayan Jahangir will be representing defending champions MI New York, while last year's runners-up Seattle Orcas have USA vice-captain Aaron Jones and Harmeet Singh in their ranks.\n\nMilind Kumar, who took a blinder against Pakistan as a substitute fielder, will play for Texas Super Kings, while Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar will play for Washington Freedom.\n\nAll this sounds good. So, what is the format of the league?\n\nLike most franchise leagues, the MLC will first have a round-robin league stage. Last year, each team played the other once, but this time every team will play seven matches each in the league stage. This has contributed to the tournament growing from 19 games last year to 25 this season.\n\nThe top two teams will meet in the Qualifier, with the winners of that match advancing to the final.\n\nThe third and fourth-placed teams will meet in the Eliminator. The winner of the Eliminator will face the team that loses the Qualifier in the Challenger, where the second finalist will be decided.\n\nYou can see the full fixture list here.\n\nBut the MLC games don't count as official T20s, right?\n\nThat was the case last year, but the tournament has been given List A status by the ICC. It has become the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire List A status from the ICC, following the UAE's ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThis means MLC will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics.\n\nAnd with the packed cricket schedule, is it not clashing with any of the several other T20 leagues around the world?\n\nThe Lanka Premier League is on till July 21, so Matheesha Pathirana will remain unavailable till Colombo Strikers are knocked out.\n\nThere will also be a six-day clash with the Hundred , which means that 12 players who are part of the MLC could arrive late at the UK.\n\nAbhimanyu Bose is a sub-editor with ESPNcricinfo",
    "summary": "**Tournament Details**\n\n* The second season of MLC starts on July 5 and ends on July 28, with a total of 25 matches.\n* The tournament will be played at two venues: Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\n**Teams**\n\n* There are six teams participating: Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, and Washington Freedom.\n* IPL franchises own four teams in the MLC, while Seattle Orcas are owned by the GMR Group, and Washington Freedom have Cricket New South Wales as their high-performance partner.\n\n**Big Names**\n\n* 23 overseas players who played in the inaugural season will return, including Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Heinrich Klaasen, and Kieron Pollard.\n* New signings include Pat Cummins, Travis Head, Steven Smith, Daryl Mitchell, Shakib Al Hasan, and Romario Shepherd.\n\n**Local Heroes**\n\n* USA cricketers who will participate in the tournament include Monank Patel, Noshthush Kenjige, Shayan Jahangir, Aaron Jones, Harmeet Singh, Milind Kumar, Andries Gous, and Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\n**Format**\n\n* The tournament will follow a round-robin league stage, where each team will play seven matches.\n* The top two teams will meet in the Qualifier, with the winners advancing to the final.\n* The third and fourth-placed teams will meet in the Eliminator, with the winner facing the team that loses the Qualifier in the Challenger.\n\n**Official Status**\n\n* MLC has been given List A status by the ICC, making it an official T20 league.\n* Tournament playing records will now be counted as official format statistics.\n\n**Scheduling Conflicts**\n\n* There will be a clash with the Lanka Premier League, which ends on July 21, and the Hundred, which means 12 players may arrive late in the UK.",

His unbeaten 62 off just 37 balls helped MI New York chase down the total of 109 runs in just 14.2 overs.\n\nWith the early wickets of Ruben Clinton (6) and USA’s national team skipper Monank Patel (8), the initial momentum seemed to be in the Seattle Orcas’ favour. Cameron Gannon was the main bowling aggressor, getting both batters in the third over and giving his team a ray of hope.\n\nBut then, Pooran proceeded to hit Gannon for 2 sixes and as many fours in his next over. This turned the tide in MI New York’s favour.\n\nEventually, Pooran’s power-hitting abilities proved to be too much for the Seattle Orcas. They got the wickets of Shayan Jahangir (3) and Tim David (12) as well, but the left-handed Pooran and his countryman Kieron Pollard (8*) took their team over the line for their first win of MLC 2024.\n\nEarlier in the day, the skills of the MI New York bowlers were on display as they bowled out the Seattle Orcas for just 108 runs. Rashid Khan and Trent Boult bagged three wickets each, never really allowing their opponents to settle into the match.\n\nNew Zealand’s star pacer Boult got the early breakthrough in the opening over itself, sending Nauman Anwar back to the pavilion for a duck. The Pakistan batter’s late attempt to cut the ball away caught a faint edge which travelled to the wicketkeeper and eventual match-winner Nicholas Pooran.\n\nWith Quinton de Kock (5) still in the crease, the Seattle Orcas could hit a competitive score, but he was also gone in Boult’s next over. His attempt to hit the ball through the leg side was met with a top edge, and Pooran did well to get underneath it and send de Kock back to the pavilion.\n\nFrom then on, MI New York were in the driving seat, getting the regular wickets. For the Seattle Orcas, Shubham Ranjane ended as the highest run-getter with a tidy innings of 35 runs in 31 balls. Finding the boundary regularly, Ranjane proved to be a threat before he tried to hit Rashid Khan for consecutive sixes but fell short in his second attempt, hitting the ball to Tim David instead.\n\nHarmeet Singh, who recently featured for the USA in the T20 World Cup, played a 20-run cameo as the side set a target that was eventually chased down by the defending champions with 34 balls to spare.\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Stats\n\nSeattle Orcas Fall of wickets: 1-1 (Nauman Anwar - 0.6 ov), 2-8 (Quinton de Kock - 2.6 ov), 3-19 (Aaron Jones - 5.4 ov), 4-31 (Heinrich Klaasen - 7.3 ov), 5-53 (Imad Wasim - 11.2 ov), 6-58 (Michael Bracewell - 12.2 ov), 7-83 (Shubham Ranjane - 15.2 ov), 8-93 (Harmeet Singh - 16.2 ov), 9-99 (Cameron Gannon - 17.2 ov), 10-108 (Nandre Burger - 19.1 ov)\n\nMI New York Fall of wickets: 1-12 (Ruben Clinton - 2.3 ov), 2-16 (Monank Patel - 2.6 ov), 3-57 (Shayan Jahangir - 6.5 ov), 4-83 (Tim David - 11.3 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nMI New York\n\nSteven Taylor\n\nMonank Patel\n\nNicholas Pooran(WK)\n\nShayan Jahangir\n\nTim David\n\nKieron Pollard(C)\n\nRashid Khan\n\nRuben Clinton\n\nEhsan Adil\n\nTrent Boult\n\nAnrich Nortje\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nQuinton de Kock(WK)\n\nAaron Jones\n\nNauman Anwar\n\nHeinrich Klaasen(C)\n\nMichael Bracewell\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nImad Wasim\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nNandre Burger\n\nZaman Khan\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Friday, July 5, 2024 20:30\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville",

Ali Khan then delivered a match-winning performance, taking four wickets for 33 runs, to restrict the Texas Super Kings to 150/8, clinching the win by 12 runs.\n\nOn what turned out to be a challenging batting wicket, the Texas Super Kings began their chase of 163 runs cautiously. Skipper Faf du Plessis (14 off 14), who attempted to accelerate the run rate, was dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the fifth over. Trying his signature scoop, he mistimed the shot and was caught by Derone Davis at mid-wicket. Aaron Hardie (11 off 14) was then sent packing by Shakib Al Hasan in the ninth over.\n\nOpener Devon Conway kept the scoreboard ticking, steadily taking the Super Kings closer to the target with timely boundaries. However, Ali Khan turned things around for the LA Knight Riders by taking three wickets in the 14th over. He bowled Conway, hitting the off-stump, then dismissed Joshua Tromp (18 off 14), who was by Derone Davis with a stunning catch, as the ball was flying off the edge to third man. The subsequent delivery saw Milind Kumar (0 off 1) caught at slip by Andre Russell. Marcus Stoinis (2 off 6) fell in the following over, scoring just two off six balls, leaving the Super Kings reeling from 100/2 to 107/6 after 15 overs.\n\nHowever, Calvin Savage took matters into his hands and kept the Super Kings in the game with a flurry of boundaries and sixes. He along with Naveen-ul-Haq smashed 17 runs off Ali Khan in the 18th over to take the equation down to 27 runs from 12 balls. Russell and Khan then bowled exceptional final two overs to close out the game for LA Knight Riders.\n\nEarlier in the contest, Texas Super Kings won the toss and opted to bowl first. Zia-ul-Haq shook the LA Knight Riders' lineup, dismissing both openers, Jason Roy (2 off 11) and Sunil Narine (2 off 3), in the third over, leaving the Knight Riders struggling at 10/2 after three overs.\n\nUnmukt Chand and Shakib Al Hasan attempted to steady the innings, but the latter fell to Aaron Hardie in the seventh over, having scored 18 off 13 balls. Nitish Kumar then added 26 runs off 17 deliveries before being dismissed in the 11th over, with the score at 78/4.\n\nDespite the rapid fall of wickets, including those of impactful players like David Miller (4 off 9) and Andre Russell (10 off 5), Chand kept one end intact. He played a magnificent knock of 68 runs from 45 balls, laced with six boundaries and three sixes, to anchor the Knight Riders' innings. He got out in the last over, but Corne Dry's onslaught of three fours off Marcus Stoinis powered the LA Knight Riders to a respectable total of 162/7 in 20 overs\n\nRunrate\n\nMatch Stats\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders Fall of wickets: 1-4 (Jason Roy - 2.1 ov), 2-5 (Sunil Narine - 2.5 ov), 3-44 (Shakib Al Hasan - 6.4 ov), 4-78 (Nitish Kumar - 10.3 ov), 5-95 (David Miller - 13.2 ov), 6-106 (Andre Russell - 14.2 ov), 7-150 (Unmukt Chand - 19.2 ov)\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-30 (Faf du Plessis - 4.3 ov), 2-64 (Aaron Hardie - 8.5 ov), 3-102 (Devon Conway - 13.2 ov), 4-103 (Joshua Tromp - 13.5 ov), 5-103 (Milind Kumar - 13.6 ov), 6-107 (Marcus Stoinis - 14.6 ov), 7-115 (Gerald Coetzee - 16.4 ov), 8-120 (Mohammad Mohsin - 17.2 ov)\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nNaveen ul Haq\n\nGerald Coetzee\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nUnmukt Chand(WK)\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nJason Roy\n\nDavid Miller\n\nAndre Russell\n\nSunil Narine(C)\n\nShakib Al Hasan\n\nAli Khan\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nDerone Davis\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Saturday, July 6, 2024 01:30\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas\n\nToss: Texas Super Kings elected to bowl",

All eyes were on Nicholas Pooran at Church Street Park in Morrisville as the West Indian wicketkeeper-batter continued his form from the 2023 edition. His unbeaten 62 off just 37 balls helped MI New York chase down 109 in just 14.2 overs. With the early wickets of Ruben Clinton (6) and USA’s national team skipper Monank Patel (8), the initial momentum seemed to be in the Seattle Orcas’ favor. Cameron Gannon was the main bowling aggressor, dismissing both batters in the third over and giving his team a ray of hope.\n\nBut then, Pooran proceeded to hit Gannon for two sixes and as many fours in his next over, turning the tide in MI New York’s favor. Eventually, Pooran’s power-hitting abilities proved to be too much for the Seattle Orcas. They got the wickets of Shayan Jahangir (3) and Tim David (12) as well, but the left-handed Pooran and his countryman Kieron Pollard (8*) took their team over the line for their first win of MLC 2024. Earlier in the day, the skills of the MI New York bowlers were on display as they bowled out the Seattle Orcas for just 108 runs. Rashid Khan and Trent Boult bagged three wickets each, never really allowing their opponents to settle into the match.\n\nNew Zealand’s star pacer Boult got the early breakthrough in the opening over itself, sending Nauman Anwar back to the pavilion for a duck. The Pakistan batter’s late attempt to cut the ball away caught a faint edge which traveled to the wicketkeeper and eventual match-winner, Nicholas Pooran. With Quinton de Kock (5) still in the crease, the Seattle Orcas could still hit a competitive score, but he was also gone in Boult’s next over. His attempt to hit the ball through the leg side was met with a top edge, and Pooran did well to get underneath it and send de Kock back to the pavilion.\n\nFrom then on, MI New York were in the driving seat, getting regular wickets. For the Seattle Orcas, Shubham Ranjane ended as the highest run-getter with a tidy innings of 35 runs in 31 balls. Finding the boundary regularly, Ranjane proved to be a threat before he tried to hit Rashid Khan for consecutive sixes but fell short in his second attempt, hitting the ball to Tim David instead. Harmeet Singh, who recently featured for the USA in the T20 World Cup, played a 20-run cameo as the side set a target that was eventually chased down by the defending champions with 34 balls to spare.\n\nUNMUKT CHAND STARS FOR LA KNIGHT RIDERS\n\nIn the second match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket, Los Angeles Knight Riders put up a brilliant show to take down the Texas Super Kings by 12 runs at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, on the opening night of the season. Unmukt Chand's brilliant 68 off 45 balls powered the LA Knight Riders to a total of 162/7 in their allotted 20 overs. Ali Khan then delivered a match-winning performance, taking four wickets for 33 runs, to restrict the Texas Super Kings to 150/8, clinching the win by 12 runs.\n\nOn what turned out to be a challenging batting wicket, the Texas Super Kings began their chase of 163 runs cautiously. Skipper Faf du Plessis (14 off 14), who attempted to accelerate the run rate, was dismissed by Spencer Johnson in the fifth over. Trying his signature scoop, he mistimed the shot and was caught by Derone Davis at mid-wicket. Aaron Hardie (11 off 14) was then sent packing by Shakib Al Hasan in the ninth over.\n\nOpener Devon Conway kept the scoreboard ticking, steadily taking the Super Kings closer to the target with timely boundaries. However, Ali Khan turned things around for the LA Knight Riders by taking three wickets in the 14th over. He bowled Conway, hitting the off-stump, then dismissed Joshua Tromp (18 off 14), who was caught by Derone Davis with a stunning catch, as the ball was flying off the edge to third man. The subsequent delivery saw Milind Kumar (0 off 1) caught at slip by Andre Russell. Marcus Stoinis (2 off 6) fell in the following over, scoring just two off six balls, leaving the Super Kings reeling from 100/2 to 107/6 after 15 overs.\n\nHowever, Calvin Savage took matters into his own hands and kept the Super Kings in the game with a flurry of boundaries and sixes. He, along with Naveen-ul-Haq, smashed 17 runs off Ali Khan in the 18th over to take the equation down to 27 runs from 12 balls. Russell and Khan then bowled exceptional final two overs to close out the game for LA Knight Riders.",
    "summary": "**MI New York vs Seattle Orcas:**\n\n* MI New York won by 6 wickets, defending their title in the opening match of the 2024 season.\n* Nicholas Pooran scored an unbeaten 62 off 37 balls, helping MI New York chase down 109 in 14.2 overs.\n* Seattle Orcas were bowled out for 108, with Rashid Khan and Trent Boult taking 3 wickets each.\n\n**LA Knight Riders vs Texas Super Kings:**\n\n* LA Knight Riders won by 12 runs in the second match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket.\n* Unmukt Chand scored 68 off 45 balls, powering LA Knight Riders to 162/7 in their allotted 20 overs.\n* Ali Khan took 4 wickets for 33 runs, restricting Texas Super Kings to 150/8 and clinching the win for LA Knight Riders.",

Saiteja Mukkamalla, Milind Kumar, Mohammad Mohsin, Cameron Stevenson, Zia Shahzad, Calvin Salvage, and Zia ul Haq are the 7 local players retained by the franchise. With only six overseas players allowed to feature in the playing eleven, it’s a hectic task for skipper Faf du Plessis and head coach Stephen Fleming to field the best possible eleven.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders didn’t meet the expectations in the first edition of the Major League Cricket as they finished last in the standings, claiming only two points. They didn’t recover from the poor batting display at the start where they bowled out for 112 and 50 against Super Kings and MI New York respectively.\n\nThey retained four players from the previous season namely Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Spencer Johnson, and skipper Sunil Narine.

Their brilliant run faced a roadblock as they suffered a defeat in the Qualifier 2 against MI New York.\n\nOn the other hand, the Sunil Narine-led team had a disappointing campaign in the last edition. The team finished at the bottom of the table and managed to win just one game. With some new acquisitions and a chance to redeem themselves this time around, the Los Angeles-based franchise will look to come back strong.\n\nMatch Details\n\nPitch Report:\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas is renowned for favouring the batters.

    "body": "by Smit Patel • Last updated on\n\nMI New York were the inaugural champions © MLC\n\nCricket in America again?\n\nYes. The new kid on the block in world cricket is back again albeit for a private bash this time. Major League Cricket (MLC) is returning for its second season, kicking off with a finale rematch from the inaugural season between MI New York and Seattle Orcas on July 5 at 2pm local time in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nErrm, I am new to this MLC thing. American cricket only caught my attention after the World Cup. Who are the teams? How long will the tournament last?\n\nMLC is currently a six-team tournament with an intention to grow into 10. The IPL teams like going global and they did not need an invite to invest in the biggest sports media market in the world. MI New York, Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders are the American offshoots of the respective IPL franchises. GMR, the part owners of Delhi Capitals also own some stake in the Seattle Orcas, co-owned by a consortium led by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. The Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns are owned by tech tycoon Sanjay Govil and a consortium led by Venky Harinarayan and Anand Rajaraman, founders of Junglee respectively. The MLC is a $120m startup with added investments of other Silicon Valley bigwigs.\n\nSeason 1 was a single round-robin followed by the knockouts. Season 2 will see 7 league games followed by the knockouts with the final on July 28 with games in Morrisville and Dallas.\n\nWho all are playing? The tournament starts within a week's time of the World Cup final in Barbados. Surely, your A-list stars are putting their feet up somewhere after a gruelling IPL and world cup odyssey.\n\nWho doesn't like coming to America for a quick round of bat and ball and endless amounts of golf! That's right, some of them hit more golf balls than cricket balls last year with a myriad of spectacular golf courses to choose from. And this is what Pat Cummins had to say after his signing with the Unicorns: \"While cricket is integral to my involvement, the global network and long-term possibilities offered by the owners specifically, and Silicon Valley more broadly presented a unique opportunity for me and my life beyond cricket.\"\n\nSeven members from the Australian T20 World Cup team headed stateside including Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, Tim David and Marcus Stoinis. World cricket's newest sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk will turn up to live up to his hype in the IPL. Some of the South African World Cup contingent namely David Miller, Kagiso Rabada, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen and Anrich Nortje too will scamper to America after Hurricane Beryl disrupted travel schedules. Nicholas Pooran, Sunil Narine and Andre Russel will bring the Caribbean flavour. Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson represent the cream of Kiwi talent in the competition.\n\nWhat about the locals? Is Saurabh Netravalkar playing? Does he have enough leaves now?\n\nFortunately he does. And he will be back on the park for Washington Freedom. USA captain Monank Patel has recuperated from his dreaded shoulder injury and will turn out for MI New York. Steven Taylor, Nosthush Kenjige and Shayan Jahangir are the other USA players on MINY roster. Unmukt Chand was seen refining his wicketkeeping skills and will be buzzing to prove a point after his World Cup snub. Chand has been retained by LAKR along with Nitish Kumar and Ali Khan.\n\nHow's the crowd buzz with no Indian players in the offing?\n\nLast year, Texas Super Kings played all of home night games in front of packed crowds and so did teams like LAKR and MINY. Super Kings fan made a spectacle out of any home game and things weren't that different at the Morrisville. By the end of the season, TSK ran out of whistles and teams like MINY ran short on merchandise despite playing at away venues in Dallas and Morrisville. The league has had a soaring fanbase right from its inception, cashing in on the already established support base of the IPL franchises among cricket watchers in America.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet\n\nTAGS\n\nRELATED STORIES",

New York skipper Kieron Pollard won the toss and opted to field first, putting the Seattle to the test. Despite their best efforts, Seattle struggled to surpass the 100-run mark, ultimately being bowled out for 108 runs in 19.1 overs.\n\nSeattle Orcas’ struggles\n\nShubham Ranjan top-scored for Seattle with 35 runs, including 2 fours and 2 sixes in his 31-ball innings. Harmeet Singh contributed 20 runs off 14 balls, hitting 2 fours and 1 six, while Aaron Jones managed 12 runs off 16 balls with 2 fours. However, the rest of the lineup faltered, with Quinton de Kock, captain Enrique Klassen, Imad Wasim and Michael Bracewell all failing to make significant contributions. New York’s bowling attack, led by Boult and Rashid, proved too formidable. Boult took 3 wickets for 25 runs in his 4 overs, while Rashid claimed 3 wickets for 22 runs. Pollard chipped in with 2 wickets for 11 runs, and Ehsan Adil and Enrique Norkia took 1 wicket each.\n\nNicholas Pooran’s match-winning knock for MI New York\n\nIn reply, New York chased down the target with ease, scoring 111 runs for 4 wickets in just 14.2 overs, securing a six wicket victory with 34 balls remaining. The highlight of the chase was Pooran’s unbeaten 62 runs off 37 balls, an innings that included 7 fours and 2 sixes. Pooran’s aggressive approach and timely boundaries kept the momentum in MI New York’s favour. Pooran was further named Player of the Match for his explosive yet calculated knock.\n\nAlso READ: Star players from IPL 2024 who will feature in the MLC 2024\n\nPooran’s brutal assault against Cameron Gannon\n\nPooran’s assault against Cameron Gannon was the defining moment of New York’s victory. With New York were at one time at a challenging 19/2 in the first four overs of the powerplay, Pooran took charge to change the course of the match. The turning point came in the fifth over, where Pooran unleashed his fury on Gannon, scoring 22 runs off the over and shifting the momentum decisively.\n\nOn the first ball of the over, Pooran played a dot ball, setting the stage for what was to come. The second delivery was slightly full and off-stump, which Pooran dispatched over wide long-on for a massive six, electrifying the crowd. This shot demonstrated his power and ability to seize scoring opportunities. Gannon’s attempt to adjust on the third ball resulted in another delivery in Pooran’s hitting zone, which he sent soaring over midwicket for another six, showcasing his aggressive intent and capacity to build pressure on the bowler.\n\nThe fourth ball saw Pooran smartly taking a double, keeping the scoreboard ticking and retaining the strike. On the fifth ball, Gannon bowled short and wide, and Pooran expertly cut it behind backward point for a four, highlighting his precision and versatility. The final delivery of the over was placed with finesse by Pooran, again behind backward point for another boundary, emphasizing his skill in finding gaps and executing shots with precision.\n\nHere’s the video:",

On the fifth delivery, Ali bowled a short ball that batter Joshua Tromp smashed towards the third man. The ball seemed destined for a boundary, flying high and fast.

Major League Cricket (MLC) hosts a professional T20 cricket league in the United States. American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) manages the league, which holds official sanctioning from both USA Cricket and the International Cricket Council (ICC). The upcoming season marks the second iteration of the league, following its inaugural season in July 2023.\n\nThe upcoming Major League Cricket 2024 season will commence on July 5 (July 6 according to IST). The games will take place at two of the most sought-after venues: Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. It was MI New York, the reigning champions, who snatched the first place in the tournament and outperformed the Seattle Orcas by 7 wickets back in the initial season.\n\nAlso Read: IND vs ZIM T20 Series: Schedule, Time In IST, Venues, Squads And Live Streaming Details\n\nThe Major League Cricket (MLC) has been growing swiftly in its second season with acquisitions like those of Steve Smith, Travis Head, Pat Cummins, and Glenn Maxwell and the addition of coaches such as Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson. Any evidence of the “M” word, MLC, or to stand on equal footing with the game of baseball is quite amazing. It is remarkable that cricket is ‘nonofficial’ but shows growth in just over one year.\n\nFollowing the T20 World Cup, where the U.S. national cricket team advanced to the second round, the second season of the competition aims to enhance its visibility.

This time around, though, LAKR started with a 12-run victory over the Texas Super Kings in Dallas with an excellent performance, spearheaded by Ali Khan, limiting the hosts throughout their run chase.\n\nLAST THREE: LWWLL\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS FORM: POOR START FOR SEATTLE\n\nOn the other hand, the Seattle Orcas started their 2024 season by being annihilated by MI New York, who defeated them in the final last year. They were skittled for just 108 before allowing that to be comfortably chased, taking just four wickets in 14.2 overs. That leaves them bottom-of-the-table, albeit having played just one game.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWL\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nLAKR’s shortcomings were, though, shown up in their second match when they suffered a six-wicket loss to the San Francisco Unicorns. There is a lack of batting depth or even just batting strength and setting a target of 166 against the Unicorns was nowhere near enough with the opposition chasing it down in just 15.2 overs. It is quite an ageing side with Jason Roy, Sunil Narine, Shakib Al Hasan and Andre Russell but the one player they should bee able to rely upon is David Miller so the South African to be their best batter in this match seems a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, after taking a four-wicket haul in their opening game, Ali Khan went wicket-less against the Unicorns and the attention turned to Aussie quick Spencer Johnson, who took 3-26. Johnson has been excellent since emerging in the last 12-18 months and the left armer to take two or more wickets once again would appear quite likely.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThere is no real pattern to emerge from the Seattle Orcas yet given they have played just one game but there will be fewer concerns about their batting line-up. Quinton de Kock’s form is a question but middle-order hitting from Aaron Jones, Heinrich Klaasen and Harmeet Singh should mean they stay in more matches – unlike against an impressive MI New York. Klaasen is the form player and now, as captain, will need to take some responsibility so a 30+ score from him would be worth backing.\n\nMI New York had the luxury of going slowly in their chase of 109 but that doesn’t mean there wasn’t some good bowling from Nandre Burger and Zaman Khan. It does appear a fairly weak attack, though, and Burger will have to be at the top of his game with him being their best bowler most likely to happen more often than not.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS SEATTLE ORCAS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nIn terms of who will come out on top, despite their very different first seasons in which LAKR finished rock-bottom and Seattle finished top, these are two very different sides. On paper, the Orcas should be set with De Kock at the top but the South African has been out of form for a while now, despite some flashes at the ICC T20 World Cup. If Johnson continues to open the bowling then backing Johnson to have a major impact on the match, up against De Kock initially, will be worth keeping an eye on.",
    "summary": "**Match Details**\n\n* The Los Angeles Knight Riders will take on the Seattle Orcas on Tuesday, July 9th, 2024, at 8:30pm ET at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\n* The weather forecast is clear skies with a temperature of 31°C (87.8°F).\n\n**Team Forms**\n\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders: Started the 2024 season with a 12-run victory over the Texas Super Kings, but then suffered a six-wicket loss to the San Francisco Unicorns. Their last three results are LWWLL.\n* Seattle Orcas: Lost their opening match to MI New York, being skittled for 108 runs, and are currently bottom of the table. Their last three results are LLWWL.\n\n**Betting Analysis**\n\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders: David Miller is a good bet to be their best batter in this match. Spencer Johnson is likely to take two or more wickets.\n* Seattle Orcas: Heinrich Klaasen is expected to score 30+ runs. Nandre Burger is likely to be their best bowler.\n\n**Expert Prediction**\n\n* The match is expected to be closely contested, with the Seattle Orcas' batting lineup being stronger on paper. However, Quinton de Kock's form is a concern. Spencer Johnson's performance could have a major impact on the match, especially against De Kock.",

Jason Roy and Sunil Narine got out cheaply. After their dismissals, Unmukt Chand played a fine knock of 68 runs in 45 balls. He hit 6 fours and 3 huge sixes during his innings. Nitish Kumar also played a nice cameo of 26 runs in 17 balls to help LA Knight Riders get to 162 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Devon Conway and Faf du Plessis started off really well for Texas Super Kings. They stitched a partnership of 30 runs for the first wicket. A couple of wickets fell in quick succession in the middle order and Super Kings all of a sudden looked in deep waters. Devon Conway kept on batting well and made 53 runs off 39 balls but he barely got any support at the other end as Texas Super Kings were restricted to 150 for 8 in 20 overs, losing the match by 12 runs.\n\nBatting Stats T20\n\nCurrent Form Washington Freedom:\n\nWashington Freedom are currently placed at the 3rd position on points table with 1 win to their credit.\n\nThe top run scorer for Washington Freedom in the Major League Cricket is Steven Smith with 46 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Washington Freedom in the Major League Cricket is Saurabh Netravalkar with 3 scalps under his belt.\n\nWashington Freedom have won their previous match against MI New York by 4 runs (DLS method).\n\nMI New York batted first and they posted a total of 154 for 9 in 20 overs. The start wasn't encouraging but Nicholas Pooran made sure that he didn't throw his wicket away. Pooran made 44 runs off 30 balls and laid the foundation for a big total. After he got out, Rashid Khan took over the role of an enforcer. He scored 31 off 15 balls and took MI New York to 154 in 20 overs of play.\n\nDuring the chase, Washington Freedom lost Travis Head quite early.

The six was so big that for a brief moment, it even disappeared in the night sky. The massive shot became one of the big highlights of this match. However, Russell's LAKR could not pick up a win in this match and lost to SFU by six wickets.\n\nRussell's 107-meter six vs Haris Rauf\n\nIn the final over of the LAKR's innings, Russell smashed the humongous hit against Haris Rauf.

Allen smashed 63 runs off 37 balls and Short played an astonishing innings of 58 runs off just 26 balls. Both of them helped the team pick up a comfortable win against the Knights.\n\n“Nice to see Finn and Shorty take the bowlers down. The boundaries aren't big. It's ideal to chase in the night but you got to bat well too. You don't have to tell them much (his top three batters). The way they play the game is extremely aggressive. That's going to come with ups and downs.

    "body": "The fifth match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket between Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings was washed out due to rain, resulting in both teams sharing a point each at Church Street Park in Morrisville on Monday. What could have been a high-scoring thriller was thwarted by the weather.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nWashington Freedom *62/0 (4.0 ov)\n\nTexas Super Kings 203/5 (20 ov)\n\nResult - Match abandoned\n\nSCORECARD\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nIn the first innings, Faf du Plessis showcased his class with an emphatic century, leading the Texas Super Kings to a huge total of 203/5 in 20 overs. Washington Freedom, on the other hand, came out all guns blazing. The Australian duo of Steve Smith and Travis Head got the run-chase going immediately, reaching 37/0 after three overs. Head, who was dropped by Dwayne Bravo off Zia-ul-Haq on the last ball of the third over, went on to score 24 runs, including two sixes and two fours, in the fourth over. Washington Freedom reached 61/0 after 4 overs before rain halted play.\n\nWith the minimum five overs not completed in the second innings, the DLS method couldn't be applied, hence the match ended in a no result and shared points. Both opening games of Washington Freedom have been rain-affected thus far, but they remain unbeaten and have jumped to the top, while Texas Super Kings are fifth in the points table.\n\nEarlier in the day, Texas Super Kings batted first. Openers Faf du Plessis and birthday boy Devon Conway got Texas Super Kings off to a flying start as they reached 67/0 in the Powerplay. Skipper du Plessis batted fluently while Conway played a supporting role, with the duo adding 109 runs in no time. Conway was the first to fall, dismissed by Saurabh Netravalkar in the 11th over after scoring 39 runs off 26 balls. The Super Kings then lost their second wicket in the following over when Aaron Hardie (2 off 5) was trapped LBW by Akeal Hosein, leaving them at 114/2 after 12 overs.\n\nAussie all-rounder Marcus Stoinis joined du Plessis and kept the scoreboard ticking at a rapid pace. Despite picking up an injury to his right hand in the 14th over, Stoinis played a vital cameo of 29 off 18 balls, forming a partnership of 62 off 29 balls with the skipper before being caught by Mukhtar Ahmed off Justin Dill in the 17th over.\n\nMeanwhile, du Plessis continued as he reached his century in 56 balls, taking the Texas Super Kings to 188/3 after 18 overs. He was immediately caught by Steve Smith at extra cover off Saurabh Netravalkar in the following over, but the TSK batters ensured they crossed the 200-run mark. This was the first time a score of 200 was achieved at this venue and the first time any team crossed this mark this season, courtesy of du Plessis' remarkable knock of 100 off 58, which included 12 boundaries and five sixes.\n\nRuns\n\nMatch Stats\n\nTexas Super Kings Fall of wickets: 1-109 (Devon Conway - 10.2 ov), 2-114 (Aaron Hardie - 11.6 ov), 3-176 (Marcus Stoinis - 16.5 ov), 4-189 (Faf du Plessis - 18.3 ov), 5-193 (Calvin Savage - 19.1 ov\n\nWashington Freedom Fall of wickets:\n\nWagon Wheel\n\nPlaying XI\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nAndries Gous(WK)\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nTravis Head\n\nSteven Smith(C)\n\nJustin Dill\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nAkeal Hosein\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nDevon Conway(WK)\n\nFaf du Plessis(C)\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nJoshua Tromp\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nZia-ul-Haq\n\nNaveen ul Haq\n\nMatch Details:\n\nDate: Monday, July 8, 2024 20:30\n\nVenue: Church Street Park, Morrisville\n\nToss: Washington Freedom elected to bowl",

Du Plessis delivered a stellar performance, scoring a brilliant century off 58 balls.\n\nHis innings were marked by aggressive and calculated shots, consistently punishing any loose deliveries from the Washington bowlers. Devon Conway provided crucial support, scoring 39 runs off 26 balls. Together, du Plessis and Conway built a solid 109-run partnership for the opening wicket.\n\nDespite dealing with an injured right hand, Marcus Stoinis contributed a vital 29 runs off 18 balls, further boosting the Texas Super Kings' total. However, Washington Freedom's bowling and fielding were below par, with several dropped catches and missed opportunities that allowed the Texas Super Kings to amass their substantial total.\n\nWhile the rain ultimately denied what could have been an exciting finish, both teams displayed promising performances. The Washington Freedom's explosive start in their chase and the Texas Super Kings' formidable batting display, particularly from Faf du Plessis, set a high standard for the rest of the season.\n\nBoth teams will look to build on these performances as the Major League Cricket season progresses, aiming to secure their positions in the tournament standings.",

But such was the spectacle in Major League Cricket when Andre Russell launched a colossal 107-meter six off Haris Rauf, leaving his teammates in awe.\n\n‌The San Francisco Unicorns clashed with the Los Angeles Knight Riders in their opening game in Dallas. Unicorns skipper Corey Anderson won the toss and chose to bowl first, a decision that initially proved effective as IPL MVP Sunil Narine was scalped by Haris Rauf in the second over.

Russell took some time to find his rhythm but began his onslaught from the 16th over onwards, saving the most spectacular moment for the 20th over. On the third ball of the final over, Rauf delivered a short-length ball angled into the stumps. Russell used his flawless judgment as he stood tall and unleashed a mighty pull shot. The timing was impeccable, and the sweet sound of the bat carried the ball out of the ground for a maximum. The shot travelled an astounding 351 feet, marking the longest six of the season.

Leading the Texas Super Kings (TSK) against the Washington Freedom (WF), Du Plessis dazzled with the bat, smashing a tremendous ton to announce his grand arrival in the US T20 tournament.\n\nStruggles in previous MLC season\n\nNotably, Du Plessis didn’t have a good time with the bat in MLC. He scored only 47 runs in the previous season of the exciting tournament and his start in the ongoing edition wasn’t promising either.. The right-handed batter managed just 14 runs in TSK’s opening game against the Los Angeles Knight Riders (LKR). Under significant pressure, Du Plessis needed to find his form, and he did so emphatically with a spectacular three-figure score.\n\nA tremendous century to mark his return\n\nDuring his stay in the middle, Du Plessis smashed 12 fours and five sixes to exhibit a batting brilliance. He was dismissed for exact 100 runs from 58 deliveries by Saurabh Netravalkar. Notably, on the last ball of the 18th over, Du Plessis reached the milestone by driving the slower leg-cutter pitched full outside off Lockie Ferguson for a boundary. Overall, it was his 6th hundred in the shortest format and the entire TSK dugout was up to applaud their captain’s knock.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Finn Allen slams Shakib Al Hasan for a hat-trick of sixes as SFU defeat LAKR in MLC 2024\n\nRain spoils the exciting match\n\nDriving on Du Plessis brilliant century, the Super Kings posted a massive total of 203/5 in 20 overs. However, his magical ton went in vain as the match ended without a result due to rain. Washington started their chase strongly, scoring 62 runs in just four overs with Travis Head (32 runs off 12 balls) and Steve Smith (26 runs off 13 balls) looking well set. Unfortunately, rain intervened after four overs, preventing the match from restarting. As a result, the game was cancelled, and both sides shared a point each.",

He continued his onslaught in the seventh over, hitting Andre Russell for two more maximums, taking his tally to five sixes across the two overs.\n\nHere’s the video\n\nAllen’s blistering knock of 63 off just 37 balls, at a strike rate of 170.27, laid the foundation for the Unicorns’ successful chase. He was ably supported by Matthew Short, who scored a quickfire 58 off 26 deliveries, as the pair added 116 runs for the second wicket.\n\nMatch summary\n\nThe Knight Riders, after being put in to bat first, posted a competitive total of 165/6 in their allotted 20 overs.

Spencer Johnson was the pick of the bowlers for the Knight Riders, finishing with figures of 3/30.\n\nAlso READ: Andre Russell smokes gigantic 107m six off Haris Rauf in SFU vs LAKR game\n\nWords from the match-winning duo\n\nSpeaking at the post-match presentation, a delighted Allen said, “It was a great team effort. The bowlers set it up nicely for us, and we just had to go out there and express ourselves. I’m glad I could contribute with the bat and help the team get over the line.”\n\nShort, who was named the Player of the Match, echoed Allen’s sentiments of the dressing room, saying, “We are joking in the change room as to who can hit the biggest sixes. I think the pitch got better to bat on under lights, probably dew played a part as well. This tournament has a lot of good players.”\n\nThe win puts the Unicorns in a strong position in the MLC 2024 standings, while the Knight Riders will look to bounce back in their next match. With players like Allen and Short in their ranks, the Unicorns will be a force to be reckoned with in the tournament.",

He counter-attacked the bowlers and brought his team back into the game with his powerful knock while batting against San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nOne of the highlights of Andre Russell's innings was the massive 107-meter that he hit against Haris Rauf. During the last over, the pacer bowled a short ball angling in, to which the batter lined it up and smashed it over wide long-on for a massive six.\n\nThe massive six by Andre Russell left the pacer Haris Rauf in shock as he didn't expect the batter to hit the six this far. Apart from the pacer, Los Angeles Knight Riders players in the dugout looked extremely jubilant as the ball went out of the ground for a massive six and the crowd at the stadium went berserk.\n\nHere's video of Andre Russel's massive six against Haris Rauf:\n\nAndre Russell ended with the innings of unbeaten 40 runs off 25 balls. He batted with a strike rate of 160 and also hit 2 fours and 3 sixes in his innings. His brutal innings in the end powered Los Angeles Knight Riders to a total of 165 runs, which at one moment seemed impossible.\n\nHowever, his effort went in vain as San Francisco Unicorns went on to win the game pretty easily. Finn Allen (63) and Matthew Short (58) played magnificently well and helped their team win the game by 6 wickets and inside the 16 overs.\n\nWe were 15-20 runs short - Los Angels Knight Riders skipper Sunil Narine\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders skipper Sunil Narine talked about the loss that his side faced against San Francisco Unicorns. He admitted that they were 15-20 runs short and also failed to take early wickets. He was confident of doing well in the next game. Speaking after the match, he stated:\n\n\"We had to take early wickets, 15-20 runs short. We could have taken early wickets but didn't bowl well. We got 160 in two games so we aren't too far from getting a big score. Just about batters digging deep. I back myself with my decisions. I didn't work today, hopefully, they work in the next game,\" he concluded.",

Chasing 155 runs, Washington already had 55 runs on board courtesy to captain Steve Smith’s blistering 46 (28) runs knock.\n\nBefore the play halted due to bad lighting, Smith’s side were four runs ahead and were awarded a win as per DLS method.\n\nWashington Freedom were calculative throughout the game. Saurabh Netravalkar and Justin Dill bowled beautifully to chip 3 wickets each. Despite Rashid Khan’s late onslaught, Washington restricted them to a decent total, and skipper Smith took care of the rest of the chase.\n\nHence, ahead of the game against Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom are expected to start as favourites.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nOn the other hand, the Texas Super Kings had a nightmarish start to the MLC 2024 season with a 12-run defeat against the Los Angeles Knight Riders. They bowled well to restrict Sunil Narine’s side to 162 runs.\n\nHowever, Super Kings failed to convert Devon Conway’s 53 (39) start to suffer an unnecessary collapse. Ali Khan took four wickets to grab the player of the match award.\n\nThat being said, to overpower Washington Freedom, the Super Kings have to take responsibility with the bat, especially captain Faf du Plessis Marcus Stoining and Aaron Hardie must play anchor roles, which will boost the confidence of the openers for the rest of the tournament.\n\nOther than that, Texas Super Kings is a well balanced side capable of making a long run into the tournament.\n\nWAS Vs TSK: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nWAS Vs TSK: Church Street Park Pitch Report\n\nChurch Street’s pitch has stayed even for both batters and bowlers so far in the tournament. With weather playing a big role, batting first and putting runs on the board is advisable. Seamers can make a huge impact given the favourable conditions.

He was the youngest player to be awarded the ICC Cricketer of the Year at the age of just 26. He also won the ICC Men’s Test Player of the Decade award from 2011-2020.\n\nSmith is the fastest Australian and sixth-fastest ever to reach 10000 runs in international cricket.

Because, for me personally, this was my dream for three years. It was a big shock, clearly. It took me a while to accept it. When you are a player, it is never going to be easy; you have lost everything back home in India and then this one thing that has been your driving force for the last three years just doesn’t come through; so it is tough. I won’t say it just happened. But it wasn’t easy.”\n\nHis inner demons were also spoken about by Chand saying that it needed many ups and downs in order to conquer such a feeling\n\n“It was quite an internal battle and basically quite frustrating. It just sucks you in all the time. It would last a day and then disappear and then return again. It hit me in different phases of reality. When you go through that over and over again you automatically become better at it. At some point you will admit that it was not even what happened, that is all about it. Not even considering it anymore,” he added.\n\nChand is now currently focused on playing Major league cricket for Los Angeles Knight Riders.",

    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nThe first match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas features the hosts, who have the rarity of home advantage in Major League Cricket, the Texas Super Kings, taking on the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nDATE & TIME: Friday 5th July, 2024 - USA ET – 8:30pm / USA PT – 5:30pm / West Indies – 7:30pm & Saturday 6th July, 2024 - UK – 1:30am / South Africa – 2:30am / Pakistan – 5:30am / India – 6:00am / Bangladesh – 6:30am / Australia – 10:30am\n\nVENUE: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, Texas, United States\n\nWEATHER: 30c or 86 F with no rain expected\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS FORM: EXPLOITING HOME ADVANTAGE\n\nIn the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in 2023, the Texas Super Kings finished in the top two of a six-team table but they were eventually beaten in the Challenger by MI New York. However, with a very CSK-influenced leadership group of coach Stephen Fleming and captain Faf du Plessis are expected to come back with a bang in 2024.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: THE RECOVERY OF LAKR\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders endured a very difficult first ever season of Major League Cricket as they finished rock-bottom. They begun their season with four successive hammerings before a slender two-wicket defeat of eventual finalists and already league winners Seattle Orcas in their final game and there will need to be a real leap from LAKR this season.\n\nLAST THREE: WLLLL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nThe Texas Super Kings will have the benefit of playing at probably the better of the two batting tracks in this tournament, at least that was the case in the ICC T20 World Cup, so there will be pressure on their top order. South Africa captain Aiden Markram didn’t have the best of World Cups with the bat but began to find some touch in the semi-final against Afghanistan and backing him to hit the ground running as TSK’s top batter in this match seems a good bet.\n\nWith the ball, TSK are set to try and damage teams with either smart change up bowling from Dwayne Bravo and Marcus Stoinis or spin with Noor Ahmad and Mitchell Santner. The best bet for them, though, to take two or more wickets in this match will be via their point of difference bowler, the excellent Naveen-ul-Haq.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nCaptained by Sunil Narine, LAKR perhaps lack a bit of depth and aggression in their batting lineup right at the top of the order but there is middle-order hitting with the likes of Shakib Al Hasan and Andre Russell. Their biggest threat, though, will be David Miller and, on what should and could be a good batting surface, backing a decent Miller score of 30+ runs seems a good bet.\n\nBowling-wise, LAKR do have the likes of Adam Zampa, Josh Little and Spencer Johnson to count on but good value could well be found in backing their domestic talents with both Ali Khan and Shadley van Schalkwyk involved. Ali Khan had a strong World Cup and backing him to take two or more of TSZ’s wickets may be worth a shot.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS VS LOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nWith just two venues in use during the 2024 Major League Cricket season, the Texas Super Kings will effectively be playing ‘home’ games at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas and whilst that seems like a nominal advantage in such a peculiar and short franchise tournament, that factor combined with their well rounded squad and LAKR’s lack of real star quality at the top with either bat or ball, as well as their failure last season, backing the Super Kings looks strong here.",
    "summary": "**Match Details**\n\n* The match is between the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders on Friday, July 5, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas, United States.\n* The weather is expected to be 30°C (86°F) with no rain.\n\n**Team Forms**\n\n* Texas Super Kings finished in the top two in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in 2023 but lost in the Challenger.\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders finished at the bottom of the table in the inaugural season.\n\n**Betting Analysis**\n\n* Texas Super Kings have a well-rounded squad and are expected to perform well at their home ground.\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders lack star quality at the top of their batting order.\n* Good betting options include Aiden Markram to score well for Texas Super Kings, Naveen-ul-Haq to take two or more wickets, and David Miller to score 30+ runs for Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n**Expert Prediction**\n\n* Backing the Texas Super Kings to win the match is a strong prediction due to their home advantage, well-rounded squad, and Los Angeles Knight Riders' lack of star quality and poor performance in the previous season.",

    "date": "Thu Jul  4 08:40:12 2024",
    "body": "After a successful inaugural season in 2023, Major League Cricket (MLC) is all set to start the second season in 2024 which will commence from July 5 to July 28.\n\nUnlike the first season's 15 league games, this season will have 21 matches in the first round of the tournament followed by four playoff games.\n\nIn the opener of the season, on the 5th of July, the defending champions MI New York, led by Kieron Pollard will take on last year's runner-ups, Seattle Orcas, led by Wayne Parnell in Church Street Park, Morrisville at 01.00 hours (IST).\n\nLater on the same day, Faf du Plesiss' Texas Super Kings will face Sunil Narine-led Los Angeles Knight Riders in Grand Prairie, Dallas at 06.00 hours (IST). Dallas' Grand Prairie stadium will host all four playoff games from July 25 to July 29.\n\nIn the inaugural season of MLC in 2023, MI New York's Nicholas Pooran top scored in the tournament with 388 runs in 8 innings followed by his IPL teammate Quinton de Kock at 264 in 7 innings. Pooran was also adjudged as the Player of The Tournament.\n\nTrent Boult, MI New York's lead pacer was the highest wicket-taker of the season with 22 wickets in 8 games followed by the Aussie duo of Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye at joint-second with 11 wickets each.\n\nBalanced San Francisco Unicorns aim for the finish line.\n\nCaptain: Corey Anderson\n\nCoach: Shane Watson\n\nHow did they fare last season: Group Stage\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns wrapped up their chequered campaign after snatching defeat from a winning position in their final group stage game against the Texas Super Kings. Reeling at 92 for 5 in the 14th over, TSK romped home with 5 balls to spare as Milind Kumar and Daniel Sams dashed the Unicorns hopes in a matter of minutes. Unicorns kicked off life at MLC in spectacular fashion against the might of MI New York, beating a much fancied opposition by 22 runs. The game also dragged Corey Anderson from cricketing oblivion after a dazzling knock of 91 off 52 deliveries. Anderson closed out the tournament as the Unicorns' highest run getter with 190 runs in 5 games.\n\nUnicorns drafted in old war horse Liam Plunkett as the primary pick for $70,000 in the draft last year. The 39 year old was worth his weight in gold, overshadowing the younger brigade of Carmi Le Roux and Haris Rauf in terms of wickets and ECON. The tournament also proved to be a nightmare for captain Aaron Finch at the sunset of his career, labouring to 68 runs and striking at a dismal 88. Unicorns stop-start campaign embodied the returns of their international stars including the likes of Marcus Stoinis and Finn Allen who failed to muster a single score of over 40 runs in 5 innings.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nThe Unicorns made some sweeping changes to their international rosters. The franchise will pin high hopes on their bumper signing of Pat Cummins. There would have been a temptation to parachute in Cummins as the captain following the leadership vacuum with the retirement of Aaron Finch but the Unicorns management bestowed the captaincy to Anderson keeping in mind his local wherewithals. World cricket's latest sensation Jake Fraser McGurk would hope to carry where he left off from the IPL where he scored 330 runs striking at 234.04 while Kiwi, Finn Allen manages to retain his spot after a pedestrian season with the bat. Josh Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford have been entrusted to add the muscle in the middle order while fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Matt Henry will find themselves at the core of the Unicorns bowling attack.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\nThe Unicorns went all out to grab former Pakistan U19 captain Hassan Khan at the MLC domestic draft this year. Khan bagged a top drawer $75,000 contract for putting on a splendid all round show in last year's Minor League Cricket tournament, amassing 220 runs in 5 innings at a S/R of 181 to go with his tally of 11 wickets at an ECON of under 5. Khan will form a troika with left arm spinning all rounders Sanjay Krishnamurthy and Karima Gore. Former West Indies wicket-keeper Jahmar Hamilton has finally been rewarded for his stellar show in the Minor League season after season. Liam Plunkett comes back for yet another MLC season in what may finally be his swansong from the sport while Carmi Le Roux has been retained to form the only left hand seaming option for the Unicorns.\n\nProbable XI : Jake Fraser McGurk, Finn Allen, Josh Inglis, Corey Anderson, Sherfane Rutherford, Tajinder Singh, Hassan Khan, Liam Plunkett, Pat Cummins, Haris Rauf, Carmi Le Roux\n\nSeattle Orcas: De Kock, Klaasen key for glory.\n\nCaptain: Wayne Parnell\n\nCoach: Pravin Amre\n\nHow did they fare last season: Runners Up\n\nSeattle Orcas stormed into the finals last year, dropping only a solitary league game in their march to the final. The Orcas were besieged at the final frontier by a whirlwind Nicholas Pooran century that counterpunched Quinton de Kock's swashbuckling 87. Orcas played some phenomenal cricket throughout the tournament on the back of some brilliant individual performances. Heinrich Klaasen's devastating knock of 110* off 44 deliveries sealed a final over thriller against a packed MI New York bowling lineup. His unravelling of Rashid Khan for a 26-run over is seen as a major inflexion point in his career.\n\nImad Wasim spun a web around the rest of the teams throughout the tournament. Bringing all his experience into play to bowl the tough powerplay overs, coming out unscathed with an economy of 6.33 and a total tally of 10 wickets in 7 games. USA World Cup star Harmeet Singh proved to be a crucial understudy to Imad as the duo fed off each other to wear down the opposition. De Kock kicked on with three half-centuries in the latter half of the tournament to top the batting charts after an indifferent start to the tournament.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nThe Orcas opted for a major overhaul to their international roster. With Dasun Shanaka, Dwayne Pretorius and Shimron Hetmyer being seen as surplus to requirements, the franchise looked to fill in obvious gaps in their roster. Pakistan death bowling specialist Zaman Khan and Proteas' new pace sensation are a couple of key signings for the Orcas this year to aid captain Wayne Parnell at the fag end of an innings. Ryan Rickleton joins De Kock and Klaasen in an already South Africa-heavy set-up. Orcas also bring in some Kiwi flavour with off-spinning allrounder Michael Bracewell in their bowling mix in addition to Imad Wasim.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\nOrcas find themselves rich in all-round talent with Shubham Ranjane, Harmeet Singh and Hamad Azam in their ranks. Ranjane proved to be a handful with his electric fielding, his array of slower balls and valuable cameos lower down the order in the inaugural season. Nauman Anwar and Shehan Jayasuriya bring in the international pedigree to their batting lineup. Anwar especially was seen to play the perfect foil for De Kock at the top of the order with some understated knocks. Cameron Gannon, an American-born Aussie state cricketer provides further depth to the Orcas pace battery. The Orcas drafted back USA vice-captain Aaron Jones in a supplemental draft in the wake of his monumental 94* in the World Cup opener.\n\nProbable XI: Quinton De Kock, Nauman Anwar, Shehan Jayasuriya, Heinrich Klaasen, Ryan Rickleton, Imad Wasim, Harmeet Singh, Shubham Ranjane, Zaman Khan, Wayne Parnell, Cameron Gannon\n\nTexas Super Kings: Star batters to backup unheralded bowlers\n\nTexas\n\nCaptain:Faf Du Plesis\n\nCoach: Stephen Fleming\n\nHow did they fare last season: Knockouts\n\nThe crowd frenzy that surrounded the Texas Super Kings in Dallas invoked a strong feeling of deja vu amongst the Super Kings fans. This unwavering support laid the first bricks to build yet another hollowed fortress 5,000 miles away from their spiritual home in Chennai. TSK kicked off their campaign last year with a thumping home win against a star studded LA Knight Riders. Devon Conway and David Miller chipped in with sparkling half centuries on that day but mostly struggled thereafter to match their opening salvo. To compound their batting woes captain Faf Du Plessis failed to cross 14 runs in any of his 7 innings while Milind Kumar was the lone half centurion among the domestics.\n\nFormer Peshawar Zalmi leg spinner Mohammad Mohsin proved to be the domestic find of the season for TSK. Mohsin started off with a bang, bamboozling the LAKR with a spell of 4 for 8 on the opening night. He further made heads turn with back to back strikes at a pivotal point in a low scorer against eventual champions MI New York, including pinning Keiron Pollard dead in front on the first ball. Dwayne Bravo turned the clock back with a ballistic 76 off 39 deliveries in their second game against Washington Freedom at the age of 39 but his body failed to last the tournament which in a way derailed the balance of the team and therefore the hopes of clinching the title for TSK.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nMatheesha Pathirana's unavailability had Stephen Fleming make an SOS call to Bravo. The 40 year old Super Kings loyalist will partner with Afghanistan's Naveen-ul-Haq to shoulder death over responsibilities for TSK. Du Plessis, who will turn 40 half way into the tournament, will take over the reins for yet another season. Aiden Markram, meanwhile, will have little time to shake off the world cup heartbreak as the South African captain is expected to line up for the opening game on July 5. The tournament also provides an excellent opportunity for Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner to find their form after missing out in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Conway would particularly be itching to go after being sidelined from the IPL owing to a fractured thumb. Marcus Stoinis will don the yellow this year after a stint with the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural season along with fellow Western Australian, Aaron Hardie.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\nMilind Kumar is expected to be the key middle order lynchpin for TSK with his experience. TSK have entrusted 18 year old South African born wicket keeper batsman Joshua Tromp as their first pick in this year's domestic draft. TSK's second draft pick, little known left arm spinner Raj Nannan hailing from Guyana surprised many in the American cricket circles. Nannan will form a spin troika with leggies Mohammad Mohsin and Zia Shehzad. Rusty Theron's retirement leaves the weight of the fast bowling mantle on the USA domestic trio of Cameron Stevenson, Calvin Savage and Zia Ul-Haq.\n\nProbable XI: Faf Du Plessis, Devon Conway, Milind Kumar, Aiden Markram, Marcus Stoinis, Joshua Tromp, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Stevenson, Naveen Ul Haq, Mohammad Mohsin, Raj Nannan\n\nBrute power, rounded bowling attack provides MI New York impetus to reclaim glory\n\nCaptain: Kieron Pollard\n\nCoach: Robin Peterson\n\nHow did they fare last season: Champions\n\nMI New York's stop start campaign peaked at the right juncture after failing to sustain winning momentum in the league stage. Kieron Pollard's unfortunate shoulder injury in the final league game paved the way for Nicholas Pooran to steward a rocky MINY ship. After securing the 4th spot by a hair's breadth, MINY gathered steam in the knockouts. Pooran's men came back from behind to stitch a 3 match winning streak with the captain capping off their historic run with an innings for the ages, a cracking of 137* off 55 deliveries in the grand finale.\n\nPooran's form remained red hot throughout the tournament, striking at 167 for his 388 runs. Tim David matched him stroke for stroke scoring at a similar clip, ending with 209 runs in his limited opportunities lower down the order. Left arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige proved to be the ultimate domestic find of the season for MINY. A nagging left arm spinner and a livewire on the field, Kenjige showed heart to bowl the tough overs in the powerplay with aplomb. Up against some superstars of T20 cricket, little known Kenjige topped the economy charts for the tournament, going at a mere 5.73 RPO in his first taste of top flight cricket.\n\nInternational Contingent:\n\nMINY have largely called upon their core group of players that have served them elsewhere under the MI banner. MI talisman Kieron Pollard will pull up his socks yet again for a franchise he has served for more than 14 seasons. Tim David and Nicholas Pooran will be back in MI colours looking to emulate their inaugural season heroics. South African youngster Dewald Brewis has been afforded yet another chance to find a breakthrough T20 season. They have also roped in West Indies all-rounder Romario Shepherd to add to their middle order muscle who is also an adequate backup for their jacked up pace attack in Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult and Anrich Nortje. MINY also have successfully retained Rashid Khan to form one of the most complete bowling attacks going around in the tournament.\n\nDomestic Cadre:\n\n37 year old former Gujarat leg spinning all-rounder Sunny Patel makes a surprise comeback to professional cricket after his move to USA. USA captain Monank Patel is expected to be back at the top of the order after being sidelined by a shoulder injury during the world cup. Steven Taylor finds himself under the injury cloud after choosing to play with a shoulder niggle. Opener Shayan Jahangir will look to further capitalise on some solid starts he had provided in the first edition for the team. MINY would hope former Pakistani pacer Ehsan Adil brings in the required depth in the pace battery to step in the role as a container in the presence of a very strong international pace attack. American born and South African raised left handed opening batsman Ruben Clinton has been rewarded with a contract for his exploits in the minor league.\n\nProbable XI: Monank Patel, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard, Tim David, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult, Nosthush Kenjige, Ehsan Adil.",
    "summary": "**Tournament Schedule**: The second season of MLC will take place from July 5 to July 28, 2024, with 21 matches in the first round followed by four playoff games.\n\n**Opening Match**: The defending champions MI New York, led by Kieron Pollard, will face Seattle Orcas, led by Wayne Parnell, in the opening match on July 5 at Church Street Park, Morrisville.\n\n**Team Updates**:\n\n* San Francisco Unicorns: Have made some changes to their international roster, including the addition of Pat Cummins and Jake Fraser McGurk. They will be led by Corey Anderson.\n* Seattle Orcas: Have overhauled their international roster, including the additions of Pakistan death bowling specialist Zaman Khan and Proteas' new pace sensation. They will be led by Wayne Parnell.\n* Texas Super Kings: Have retained Faf du Plessis as their captain and have added Aiden Markram, Devon Conway, and Mitchell Santner to their international roster.\n* MI New York: Have largely retained their core group of players, including Kieron Pollard, Tim David, and Nicholas Pooran.\n\n**Notable Players**:\n\n* Nicholas Pooran (MI New York) was the top scorer in the inaugural season with 388 runs in 8 innings.\n* Trent Boult (MI New York) was the highest wicket-taker in the inaugural season with 22 wickets in 8 games.\n\nI hope this summary provides a helpful overview of the article!",

Oh, and it’s been some revolution this! From introducing the game to ordinary Americans to becoming a raging success, Major League Cricket is all set to push the boundaries further in 2024. IT’S ONE DAY AWAY. Okay, you’ve got questions? We hear you? Here’s your cheat sheet to everything you need to know..\n\nAnother cricket party? No wait, didn’t the World Cup just get over?\n\nThe World Cup was just the start, the MLC will now take it to the crescendo! The second season is here – six iconic cities, two venues, 23 days, and MI New York out there to defend their crown. A host of world class cricketers have assembled in town, and are all set to inspire another whole generation of young American fans.\n\nSo who’s playing? What’s the format?\n\nThere’s the defending champions, MI New York, the runner’s up, Seattle Orcas, Faf du Plessis-led Texas Super Kings, fresh from winning the IPL, Sunil Narine-led LA Knight Riders, fresh from inducting Pat Cummins, San Francisco Unicorns, and the Washington Freedom.\n\nEach team would play seven league games, and the top four will then proceed to the playoffs. The first leg of the tournament would take place at Church Street Park in Morrisville, before he caravan moved to the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nCould you recap season one please?\n\nSo we won. It was a tight road until the final though, with MI New York having to win their last four games to win the title. And they did it in style, with Trent Boult getting four-fer after four-fer, young Dewald Brevis playing some clutch knocks in the middle-order, Tim David finishing games for fun like only he can, and Monank Patel getting us off to fliers. Come the final, against Seattle Orcas, it was the Nicholas Pooran show, with a blazing 137-run-knock to give us our moment of history!\n\nWoah, Defending Champs! What’s new this time then?\n\nAnrich Nortje, with his 150kph thunderbolts, is all set to don the Blue and Gold, and it is going to be a dream to watch him bowl in tandem with Trent Boult and Kagiso Rabada. Also Romario Shepherd, fresh from his assault in the IPL for Mumbai Indians and then in the T20 World Cup for West Indies, is here too. Four other youngsters, Rushil Ugarkar, Heath Richards, Ruben Clinton and Sunny Patel have come into the mix as well. But the core of the team remains the same, with Kieron Pollard, the MI #OneFamily legend, along with Nicholas Pooran, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Tim David and the USA star players like Steven Taylor, Monank Patel and Shayan Jahangir.\n\nAnd what’s new with the MLC in 2024?\n\nA few extra matches. Last year saw each team play a single round-robin, but this time there are two extra games in the league. It’s just gotten bigger. But should remain the same though is the passion the league generated among the supporters, who thronged to the stadium in large numbers.\n\nOkay, I’m already excited..what’s the schedule?\n\nJuly 5, 3:30pm EDT (July 6, 1am IST) - MI New York vs Seattle Orcas\n\nJuly 6, 3pm EDT (July 7, 12:30am IST) - Washington Freedom vs MI New York\n\nJuly 12, 3pm EDT (July 13, 12:30am IST) - MI New York vs Texas Super Kings\n\nJuly 14, 7:30pm CDT (July 15, 6am IST) - Texas Super Kings vs MI New York\n\nJuly 16, 7:30pm CDT (July 17, 6am IST) - MI New York vs Washington Freedom\n\nJuly 18, 7:30pm CDT (July 19, 6am IST) - MI New York vs San Francisco Unicorns\n\nJuly 21, 7:30pm CDT (July 22, 6am IST) - LA Knight Riders vs MI New York",

With some new recruits onboard and as a much stronger-looking outfit, WAF will look to better their performance and eventually lift their maiden MLC title.\n\nHere is a look at the Washington Freedom squad for the MLC 2024.\n\nBatters: Steven Smith, Akhilesh Reddy, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed\n\nAll-rounders: Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra\n\nBowlers: Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nStrength of Washington Freedom for MLC 2024\n\nVariety and depth in the overseas recruits\n\nThe Washington Freedom have recruited some high-quality overseas players ahead of the MLC 2024 season. These recruits will give them strength ahead of the season alongwith variety and flexibility to field teams based on the strength of the opposition and the playing conditions.\n\nWhile Steven Smith, Travis Head and Rachin Ravindra will add stability to the top order, Glenn Maxwell, alongside Andries Gous, will give them the firepower in the middle order.\n\nIn the bowling department, they will have Akeal Hosein in the spin department, with Lockie Ferguson, Andre Tye and Marco Jansen rounding up in the pace front. An overall look gives us the idea that they have plenty of resources to use as per the playing conditions, and they go with a 'horses for courses' policy.\n\nWeaknesses of Washington Freedom for MLC 2024\n\nLack of experience in the spin department\n\nAkeal Hosein will be in charge of the team's spin department. Besides leading this aspect of the team, he will have the majority of the task of controlling the opposition in the middle overs and picking up wickets. There is a lack of experienced spinners in the squad, and the skipper will have to turn to Glenn Maxwell and even Rachin Ravindra to get some efficient overs in the middle overs.\n\nOver-dependency on Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell for power hitting\n\nMost of the batters in the Washington Freedom look like grafters. They will take time to settle down before shifting gears. Thus the Freedom will have an over-dependency on Travis Head at the top and Glenn Maxwell in the middle order to increase the team's scoring rate.\n\nWashington Freedom Predicted XI for the first match",

Known for his stellar leadership record with Australia, Smith brings a wealth of experience to the role, having led his national team to numerous victories in Tests, ODIs, and T20Is.\n\nThe franchise made the official announcement on social media platform X, where they welcomed Smith with the tagline, “Oh Captain, Our Captain, Smudge is all set to lead the Freedom squad for #MLC2024.”\n\nSmith, renowned for his impactful performances in cricket leagues worldwide, previously captained IPL teams like Pune Warriors, Rising Pune Supergiants, and Rajasthan Royals. His leadership stint with Rising Pune Supergiants saw them reach the IPL 2017 final.\n\nPreviously, Moises Henriques, Smith's former teammate from Australia, led Washington Freedom in the MLC 2023 season, where the team reached the playoffs but fell short against inaugural champions MI New York.

    "body": "Defending champions MI New York will host 2023 finalists Seattle Orcas in the opening game of the Major League Cricket 2024. The Kieron Pollard-led side had a very rough time in the league stage of last year but they changed things quickly, dominating the latter half of the tournament.\n\nThey have some of the fiercest strikers of the ball in Nicholas Pooran, Tim David and Steven Taylor while among bowlers, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada can dominate any attack.\n\nWhen it comes to Seattle, their bowling unit is a bit concerning. Zaman Khan and Nandre Burger are two exciting options but it may prove difficult for them to stop New York’s juggernaut. Among batters, Aaron Jones, Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen will be extremely vital. Pakistan’s Imad Wasim can be crucial on the slow pitches of the US too.\n\nMatch Details\n\nChurch Street Park Pitch Report:\n\nIt’s a decent track. Bowling first will help and anything over 175 runs will be a good score on the surface.\n\nNY vs SEA Head-to-Head Record\n\nNY vs SEA Probable Playing XIs\n\nMI New York:\n\nSteven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Monank Patel (wk) Nicholas Pooran, Kieron Pollard (c), Tim David, Dewald Brewis, Rashid Khan, Romario Shepherd, Trent Boult, Ehsan Adil,\n\nSeattle Orcas:\n\nQuinton de Kock (wk), Nauman Anwar, Shehan Jayasuriya, Heinrich Klaasen, Shubham Ranjane, Imad Wasim, Michael Bracewell, Wayne Parnell (c), Harmeet Singh, Obed McCoy, Cameron Gannon\n\nNY vs SEA Probable Best Players of the Match\n\nProbable Best Batter:\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nWest Indies international Nicholas Pooran was sensational in the recently concluded T20 World Cup. Lately, he has been terrific in the shortest of the game and is difficult to stop when he is in the zone. Against a moderate bowling unit of Seattle, Pooran can wreak havoc.\n\nProbable Best Bowler:\n\nRashid Khan\n\nLike Pooran, Rashid was incredible in the T20 World Cup. He was one of the forces to reckon with, with the ball for Afghanistan and given his form, the spinner can prove to be dangerous.\n\nToday’s Match Prediction: MI New York to win the match\n\nScenario 1\n\nMI New York win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 40-50\n\nSEA: 155-175\n\nMI New York win the match\n\nScenario 2\n\nSeattle Orcas win the toss and opt to bowl.\n\nPowerplay: 35-45\n\nNY: 175-195\n\nMI New York win the match",
    "summary": "**Match Preview**: The 2024 Major League Cricket tournament is set to begin with a match between defending champions MI New York and 2023 finalists Seattle Orcas. MI New York, led by Kieron Pollard, had a rough start in the league stage last year but made a strong comeback to win the title.\n\n**Teams and Squads**: MI New York boasts a strong team with power hitters like Nicholas Pooran, Tim David, and Steven Taylor, and a formidable bowling unit featuring Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Anrich Nortje, and Kagiso Rabada. Seattle Orcas, on the other hand, have a concerning bowling unit, but their batting lineup includes Aaron Jones, Quinton de Kock, and Heinrich Klaasen, with Imad Wasim being a key player on slow US pitches.\n\n**Pitch Report and Head-to-Head Record**: The Church Street Park pitch is decent, and bowling first will be advantageous. A score of over 175 runs is expected to be competitive. MI New York and Seattle Orcas have not played each other before, making this a maiden encounter.\n\n**Probable Playing XIs and Match Prediction**: The probable playing XIs for both teams are mentioned in the article. Nicholas Pooran is expected to be the best batter, while Rashid Khan is expected to be the best bowler. The match prediction is that MI New York will win the match, regardless of who wins the toss.",
