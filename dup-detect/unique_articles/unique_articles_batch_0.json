I can't wait to meet all of my new teammates and play in front of some incredible crowds in America.\n\n\"I'm also really looking forward to working with Ricky Ponting again and his amazing staff. Can't wait for the season.

I'm not really too fussed either way. If I'm there, I'm there; if I'm not, I'm not.\"\n\nBut his signing caps an increasingly strong-looking Australian involvement in the tournament.\n\nAdam Zampa and Spencer Johnson will be at the Los Angeles Knight Riders, while Tim David will play for MI New York, the Mumbai Indians'-owned team, with more Australian stars still expected to be snapped up.",

MI New York restricted Seattle Orcas to 183/9 before chasing down their target in just 16 overs.\n\nMI New York didn't get off to the best of starts as Imad Wasim dismissed Steven Taylor in their third delivery of the opening over. However, Pooran made his intentions quite clear for the night when he struck consecutive sixes off Wasim's bowling in the same over. The West Indian showcased tremendous form as he hit Dwaine Pretorius for three sixes and two boundaries in the third over.\n\nOpening batter Shayan Jahangir fell to Wayne Parnell in the fifth over, but Pooran continued to find maximums at the other end. He struck three sixes off Andrew Tye's bowling to take MI New York's score to 80/2 in just 6 overs. Pooran kept finding the middle of his bat and smashed a total of 10 fours and 13 sixes during his innings. The Captain remained unbeaten on 137 runs off 55 balls and single-handedly took MI New York over the line with 4 overs to spare.\n\nEarlier in the day, MI New York won the toss and put Seattle Orcas into bat. Quinton de Kock looked in prime touch as he struck Jessy Singh for consecutive boundaries in the second over. However, Rashid Khan sent De Kock's opening partner Nauman\n\nAnwar packing for 9 runs off 13 balls in the fifth over. Thereafter, Shehan Jayasuriya provided excellent support to De Kock as he hit David Wiese for a four and six in the seventh over. But Steven Taylor bowled him out for 16 runs off 15 balls in the tenth over.\n\nFollowing Heinrich Klaasen's early departure, De Kock and Shubham Ranjane put up a fantastic partnership of 51 runs from 24 balls to take Orcas' score to 142/4 in 16.1 overs. Thereafter, the Orcas kept losing wickets at regular intervals, but Dwaine Pretorius' cameo of 21 runs from 7 balls helped his team post a formidable total on the board.\n\nSpeaking about his team's victory, the leading run-scorer in the tournament and MLC Season 1 MVP Nicholas Pooran said, \"We spoke today about having an opportunity to do something special. I am very proud of everything every individual did and everyone contributed in some way. The people in the dressing room told me that I just needed to bat like Nicky P and not think about batting like the captain. I just backed my skills. The platform was there today and the opportunity was there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Seattle Orcas' Captain Wayne Parnell said, \"Whenever someone plays like that, you have to give them credit. Credit to Nicky and his team. It did not look like he (Pooran) would mishit a ball today. We put up a decent total but we have to give them credit today. The first MLC season has gone really well. Credit to everyone who has organized it. Credit to our owners and the management for picking this team and giving us the freedom to play this brand of cricket.\"\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nMI New York 184/3 (Nicholas Pooran 137*, Dewald Brevis 20, Imad Wasim 1/14) beat Seattle Orcas 183/9 (Quinton de Kock 87, Shubham Ranjane 29, Rashid Khan 3/9) by 7 wickets.\n\nCatch the latest stock market updates here.

    "title": "Kieron Pollard: 'A lot of people are sprinting through those franchise doors'",
    "date": "Fri Jul 14 12:55:00 2023",
    "body": "As he prepares to lead MI New York in the inaugural MLC season, the West Indies legend reflects on the changing attitudes to T20 franchise cricket\n\n1:14\n\nPollard on franchise cricket: 'Now everyone's seeing the light'\n\nIt's been more than a decade since Kieron Pollard was branded a \"mercenary\" for choosing to chance his arm in the emerging T20 franchise market, rather than knuckle down in the West Indies national set-up and allow his future to be determined by the vagaries of form and selectorial whim.\n\nBut now, at the age of 35, as he sits in his hotel-room in Grand Prairie, Texas, awaiting his latest venture in USA's Major League Cricket (MLC), it's safe to say he feels vindicated - by the career he's made for himself on the one hand, but also by the path he's set for others to follow.\n\n\"I just sit back with a smile on my face, knowing that we were 10-15 years ahead of everybody,\" Pollard tells ESPNcricinfo, as he contemplates cricket's shifting sands, and the growing recognition that this generation of franchise-first cricketers are no longer simply seen as renegades by the wider game, but as pioneers in an ever-evolving sport.\n\nRelated\n\nDeandra Dottin warns West Indies to get their house in order\n\nTexas brings the vibe and welcomes franchise cricket to America\n\nCricket's American dream takes flight - 'This season is about proving we can do it'\n\nMLC: Teams, players, format, fixtures, and everything else you need to know\n\nRoy agrees termination of ECB incremental contract to play in MLC\n\n\"I got a lot of stick for it for various reasons, because certain persons couldn't see past their noses,\" he adds, recalling his run-ins with West Indies board members back in the day, not least in 2010, when he turned down a central contract that would have required him to renege on his T20 Blast deal with Somerset.\n\n\"But it is what it is. Hopefully, those persons now, who are speaking about all this as a 'big delight' and 'so amazing', hopefully they remember the words they were using not too long in the past, to describe myself and others who had a choice to make at that particular time.\"\n\nThe rest, you could say, is a history that Pollard is still in the process of writing. And his next chapter will unfold at the as-yet unassuming Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas, when he leads out MI New York against San Francisco Unicorns on Friday night.\n\n\"In this day and age, we're still unearthing new T20 tournaments,\" he adds, and even the man himself might be hard-pressed to recall every team that he's turned out for in the course of his globe-trotting career - one that's taken him from Trinidad to India, to England, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and most places in between … even to Canada for two seasons of the Global T20 League in 2018 and 2019.\n\nMore recently, however, one common theme has tended to underpin Pollard's global exploits. After 13 richly decorated seasons with Mumbai Indians in the IPL, he was in action earlier this year for MI Emirates in the inaugural ILT20 in the UAE. And now here he is, captaining Mumbai's fledgling USA franchise, and providing vital continuity between these as-yet loosely affiliated teams, as the Ambani family continues to push that brand recognition around the globe.\n\n\"That's a relationship and a connection that has been created over more than a decade,\" Pollard says, having played more than 200 matches for Mumbai, and been involved in five IPL and two Champions League T20 titles. \"If you understand the fact that Indian players can't play around the world, I'm the closest thing in terms of connection to build a franchise and to build a brand. So yes, you can say I'm a pioneer in that aspect of it as well.\n\n\"Obviously I've played cricket in America before, but only in Florida. Coming here to the Texan heat is going to be different,\" he adds. \"But I'm pretty excited to see what's there to offer.\n\n\"At some point in time, we're going to have our stadium in New York, and the people of New York will come out to support us. I think it's a great concept. There's plenty room for cricket in America. Obviously we know what American sports dominate the TV headlines, but hopefully, this is the start of something for a long period of time.\"\n\n\"I've seen the speculation about 12-month contracts for Jofra; I don't know anything about that. But at some point in time, it's being touted that this is going to happen. And I can't see it not happening.\"\n\nKieron Pollard\n\nOther familiar names fill out MI New York's overseas slots. Trent Boult now plays for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, but as Player of the Match in Mumbai's most recent title success in 2020, he still holds a large measure of affection from the aficionados. And then there's Australia's Tim David, \"one of the new entertainers of T20 cricket,\" as Pollard himself describes his heir apparent in Mumbai's middle-order, and the man upon whom much of MI New York's publicity in the Big Apple itself was focussed prior to the tournament.\n\nMonth by month, tournament by tournament, therefore, the inevitability grows that 12-month franchise contracts are the next big disruption to the sport as it is currently known. A lot of the speculation in that regard has centred around another of Mumbai's prize assets, Jofra Archer, whose recovery from an ongoing elbow problem has been a co-operative arrangement between the franchise's medical team, and the ECB.\n\n\"I've seen the speculation about 12-month contracts for Jofra; I don't know anything about that,\" Pollard says. \"I don't know if anyone, at this point in time, is actually on [one of those]. But at some point in time, it's being touted that this is going to happen. And I can't see it not happening.\n\n\"It's an ever-changing scenario, but that's what life is about,\" he adds. \"Life is about change, and it's about adapting to change. Long ago, we might not have been able to have this interview, face-to-face on different continents, because of technology. So we need to adapt to change in all facets of life.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can see the benefits of it, and hopefully, the 'board games' - the franchise game and the international game - can mesh together and find that right balance to characterise the importance of certain tournaments and understand that international cricket has its place as well in the calendar with the franchises.\"\n\nThere's little doubt, however, that Pollard is revelling in a satisfying degree of schadenfreude as he watches the same issues that, back in the day, tore the fabric of West Indies cricket now affect even the more powerful boards in the international game.\n\nBack in February, for instance, when several England players - including Alex Hales, Sam Billings and Liam Dawson - opted out of a white-ball tour of Bangladesh to honour their contracts in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), England's managing director, Rob Key, acknowledged that the \"life-changing sums of money\" on offer for \"a few weeks' work\" meant it was increasingly hard to criticise those who were putting club over country. And now, we can add to that number Jason Roy, the only active England player involved in this year's MLC, whose deal with LA Knight Riders required the early termination of his ECB contract.\n\nResponding to Key's quotes back in February, Pollard wrote on Instagram: \"Live to see this day. Eight years ago, different names we called it.\"\n\n\"Some of us were forced in a corner, and we were vilified for it,\" Pollard says. \"But now the pathway is clear. Everyone is seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and I've just seen a lot of people sprint through those doors. I just sit back with a smile on my face, with typical Caribbean flair, maybe watching the blue seas and the sand, and just taking in the movie.\"\n\nOn the face of it, West Indies' standards have continued to plummet in recent years, with their recent failure to qualify for the ODI World Cup marking a new nadir in their fortunes. And yet, as one of the players whose IPL experience was a vital component of their two T20 World Cup titles in three attempts between 2012 and 2016, Pollard remains adamant that he and his team-mates have more than done their bit for the region.\n\n\"We won two World Cups with the West Indies team, and there have been different talents coming out. But we weren't able to capitalise,\" he said.\n\n\"For us in the Caribbean, when we had the opportunity to understand where the game was going, we were stubborn. We had guys saying 'you can't do this' or 'you can't do that'. And then all the legal ramifications came into play, rather than saying, 'this is the future, let's find a way'. If we had done that, things would have been different.\n\n\"What T20 Cricket gives you is an opportunity for longevity in your career,\" he adds. \"What is too much? You don't know. But it's just a matter of balancing it out and understanding that every tournament and every version of cricket has a place on the international calendar.\"\n\nMLC's place in the calendar is yet to be fully determined. This year's taster season is a mere two weeks long, but Pollard is optimistic about the extent to which the tournament can capture local imagination - especially if the USA's hitherto lesser-known players can seize on their moments in the limelight, and help to show the American grassroots game that there's a genuine living to be made from the sport.\n\nMI New York squad includes the current USA captain and wicketkeeper, Monank Patel, who was in recent action at the World Cup qualifier in Zimbabwe, and Steven Taylor, whom Pollard describes as \"as one of the best cricketers going around in America\".\n\n\"This tournament gives them an opportunity to rub shoulders with the quality of players in our squad,\" Pollard adds. \"It will help them grow their game, so that they can become stalwarts of the American game in their own right.\n\n\"They've always had different persons trying to start up [cricket in the USA], but this is an opportunity to set the benchmark, and hopefully the backing of the Indian franchises will give MLC a chance to be futuristic, rather than just a pop-up tournament.\n\n\"Every tournament has its own cultural differences, and the quality can be different too. But what I can safely say, no doubt, the IPL has the right template as the best T20 league in the world. All the others, they won't be able to compete but, with the right persons behind it and the right structures, in whatever country you are, you can have a decent league. Obviously, the IPL is No.1 and everybody else will be second.\"\n\nKieron Pollard is an Investor and Ambassador for Me + U\n\nAndrew Miller is UK editor of ESPNcricinfo. @miller_cricket",

Cricket as a sport has remained USA's Achilles Heel and with some of the younger players set to rub shoulders with the best T20 players in the world, the tournament is not only hoping to expand the game beyond traditional territories but also give a platform to the young players, who will be seen with some of the best.\n\nThe 19-game tournament will be played at two venues - Dallas and Morrisville - with a hope to take the game beyond just a couple of centres and ensure that since there are two venues, the demand for tickets will be at an all-time high. The six teams are based in some of the most popular and traditional American cities - Los Angeles, Texas, New York, Washington DC, San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nThree of these teams have been purchased by the teams owning the IPL sides, Chennai Super Kings (Texas), Mumbai Indians (New York) and Kolkata Knight Riders (Los Angeles), while the co-owners of the Delhi Capitals have a stake in Seattle Orcas. The tournament promises to be a cracker since it's short and sweet while it could serve as the curtain-raiser for more games in the US, given there's a T20 World Cup to be hosted next year in June.\n\nWhen and where to watch Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023 in India on TV and streaming?\n\nThe Major League Cricket (MLC) while being an exciting proposition to expand the game beyond usual territories is a noble cause but since it's in America, the viewing will be affected in countries far east like the Indian subcontinent, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania. The day-night matches will begin at 6 AM while the day matches have a 2 AM IST start.\n\nThe inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket (MLC) will have a live broadcast through the Sports18 channel on TV while the streaming of all the games will be available on the Jiocinema app and website.",

    "body": "Jason Roy has become the first England player to end his national contract in order to play franchise cricket.\n\nOpener Roy has opted to cancel his incremental England deal - worth £60,000-£70,000 - to play in the American Major League Cricket, where he could earn £150,000 for one season.\n\nThe 32-year-old will still be available for national selection.\n\nRoy said: \"To be very clear, my priority is England cricket, especially with a World Cup soon upon us.\"\n\nWriting on social media, he added: \"It is for me, and for any player, the greatest honour to receive a cap to play for their country.\n\n\"I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will walk away from England.\"\n\nAn England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) statement said: \"Jason Roy has informed the England and Wales Cricket Board that he wishes to take up an agreement with Major League Cricket in the USA later this summer.\n\n\"The ECB have agreed for him to play in the competition on the proviso that he gives up the remainder of his ECB incremental contract, which both parties have agreed to.\n\n\"The ECB wish to clarify that this decision will not affect Jason's selection for England teams going forward. We have absolute confidence and faith that Jason is committed to England cricket.\"\n\nRoy has been a key component of England's dominance of the global white-ball game, a regular in the side that was crowned 50-over world champions in 2019.\n\nHowever, a loss of form saw him dropped from the squad that won the T20 World Cup last year and, in October, he saw his central contract downgraded to an incremental deal.\n\nWith Major League Cricket taking place between the T20 Blast and The Hundred, Roy might have been ordered to rest by England, especially with the defence of the 50-over World Cup on the horizon in India in October and November.\n\nInstead, Roy will end his England deal, forgo the rest of his salary up to its expiry at the end of September.\n\n\"Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer,\" added Roy.\n\n\"I hope to play for England for many more years. That remains my priority.\n\n\"I've had clear and supportive conversations with the ECB about participating in Major League Cricket. The ECB were happy with me to play in the competition as long as they didn't have to pay me for the remainder of the contractual year.\n\n\"As a single-format player with no central contract I wanted to take the opportunity to play this competition as there are currently no scheduling conflicts with England. It benefits me as an England player to play as much competitive cricket as possible.\"\n\nWriting on Twitter former England captain Michael Vaughan wrote: \"I don't get the big issue about Jason Roy. He hasn't got any England games and has been offered a nice contract in the States so he has taken it. It is inevitable that we will see more of this in the future. And I have no problem with it.\"\n\nThough there is some overlap with the Blast, it is understood Roy will remain with his county Surrey if they reach finals day, before returning to play for Oval Invincibles in The Hundred in August.\n\nRoy has played five Tests, 116 one-day internationals and 64 T20s for England, scoring almost 6,000 international runs.\n\nHis decision is the latest in a fast-changing landscape of global cricket, with the money on offer to players in franchise leagues challenging the primacy of international matches.\n\nA number of players chose to skip England's white-ball tour of Bangladesh earlier this year in favour of franchise deals, while there have been reports of franchise owners preparing to offer long contracts to the biggest stars.\n\nEarlier this month, former England all-rounder Ravi Bopara told the Test Match Special podcast: \"It is a real thing to start thinking about for the players.\n\n\"If they are offering long-term contracts, I'm talking three, four or five years, then it is a serious subject to start thinking about as a player.\"\n\nIn response, England are set to revamp their central contract system, with greater flexibility and possibly more money on offer.\n\nSome players could be offered multi-year deals to guard against the attraction of franchise leagues.\n\nWhite-ball specialists could be offered small retainer contracts but increased match fees, to make England tours more financially attractive than a stint playing in a league.",

    "title": "Supercharged season one prompts MLC's organisers to dream bigger",
    "date": "Wed Aug  2 18:05:00 2023",
    "body": "Home and away fixtures? A 34,000-seater stadium in New York? If the league can build on the momentum it has already generated, why not?\n\nWhen considering that USA's first home ODI in September 2019 only drew 19 people, that too for games staged in the country's only ICC-accredited venue at the time, in Florida, the bar of expectations couldn't have been set lower for what constitutes success when it comes to getting fans to turn out for a domestic cricket event in the USA. In a sense, the only way to go was up when starting from that foundation.\n\nThat's all the more reason why the events of the last three weeks, in which the first season of the Major League Cricket T20 franchise tournament routinely played to sold-out venues in North Carolina and Texas, were all the more startling. What many people, including the organisers themselves, thought might take several seasons to gain momentum in terms of fan attendance and player buy-in wound up being more supercharged than a case of Red Bull in season one.\n\nRelated\n\nMLC projected to spend $110 million on facilities ahead of 2023 launch\n\nCan cricket's American dream become a reality?\n\nTexas brings the vibe and welcomes franchise cricket to America\n\nCricket through the eyes of two baseball fans in America\n\nMajor League Cricket's conundrum: who exactly is an American player?\n\n\"My thought was we'll start slow, we'll get some fans in, we'll entertain them, we'll put out a good product, and then we'll build upon it year on year,\" MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta told ESPNcricinfo after the conclusion of the tournament final in Texas. \"I feel like we've skipped a couple of years now in our journey and we can start doing the things now which we'd be doing two years from now.\"\n\nAccording to MLC tournament director Justin Geale, league officials were counting on the opening night and the final to be sold out, but had no expectations as to everything in between, particularly from the seven match days in Grand Prairie, Texas. What unfolded was way beyond his cautiously optimistic expectations. On average, Grand Prairie Stadium wound up playing to more than 80% capacity across the nine match dates held at the 7,200-capacity venue, while the six-day slate of fixtures at the 3,000-capacity Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, all sold out. It meant that more than 70,000 fans - generating $2.8 million in ticket sales revenue - came through the gates to watch season one of MLC, a staggering number for any matches on US soil not involving India's routine visits to Lauderhill to play T20Is against the West Indies.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable part of all of this is that these numbers were possible in spite of dismal attendances for the three afternoon games held as part of scheduled double-headers at Grand Prairie Stadium, which were shoehorned into the calendar in spite of the oppressive daytime heat - temperatures regularly hovered over 110 degrees Fahrenheit (mid 40s Celsius) - in order to squeeze the tournament into a tight window following the end of the World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe and before the start of the Hundred in England. Addressing that is a key priority heading into season two.\n\nTwo solutions have been floated by MLC officials, either moving the afternoon match back to an early-morning start on days where two matches need to be played, or scheduling double-headers in different cities on the same day, one in the east coast time zone in the late afternoon or early evening before coming back to Texas for a 7:30 or 8 pm start. The fact that a split-venue double-header is even plausible despite the added broadcast production costs - one source tabbed it at a minimum of $350,000 - shows how supercharged the plans are for season two just days after the conclusion of season one.\n\nNow that MLC officials have the proof of concept that they can sell out a 7,200-seat venue multiple times in the space of a week, they aren't holding back with bigger-picture ambitions. Among those is a goal to \"piggyback\" off the proposed plan put forward by the ICC last week to have a 34,000-seat pop-up venue in New York City at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. If that proposal gets greenlit by NYC officials for the ICC to proceed with as one of three venues in the USA when it co-hosts the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, Mehta says he is already in discussions to make it the home venue for reigning champions MI New York in MLC season two next July, immediately after the T20 World Cup final scheduled for June 30.\n\n\"That would be very very desirable for us and we have indicated as much to the ICC,\" Mehta said. \"We'd love to collaborate with them not just on venues, but also in marketing and other aspects. If 2024 is going to be a watershed year for both MLC and the ICC, from our perspective a longer season and a much more impactful season and a season where we have some time and space to properly market and properly showcase the product. From the ICC's perspective, the World Cup is a huge event. So we'd just love to collaborate with them on venues and marketing and a few other elements. And they've indicated a reciprocal desire to want to make sure that we utilise next summer to completely evangelise the sport here.\"\n\nThe Texas Super Kings were by far the best-supported franchise in year one, with all their home games selling out. But the sold-out final - in which an extra 800 standing-room-only tickets were put on sale in the 48 hours before play began, to expand capacity by another 10% to accommodate a late surge in demand from MI New York fans - highlighted the biggest priority of all for the next few years of the league, according to Mehta. Long-term stadium infrastructure plans are now of paramount importance in the short term if the league is going to not only sustain but build on this year's success.\n\n\"We need home and away venues,\" Mehta said, alluding to the lowest-attendance match of the season between San Francisco Unicorns and LA Knight Riders at the end of the first week of matches in Texas, which saw approximately 2,500 fans turn out in Grand Prairie. \"I think all the team owners saw it clearly. It's one thing to put it up in a presentation and to raise funds. It's another thing for team owners to see directly themselves that here's what happens when you have a home venue, because all American franchise sport is built around home venues and a home-and-away concept.\n\n\"So they are far more enthusiastic now and now that they've seen it firsthand about building home venues and quickly building them. So that's been the number one benefit of this season. The reception the Texas Super Kings got was frankly something that all the owners had to see for themselves to understand that now they need to put their plans into action very quickly.\"\n\nThere were other teething issues that the league adapted to on the fly during season one. But often they were good problems to have - and certainly not the kind that US cricket administrators have ever thought they'd encounter - such as fans waiting too long in lines to get through the entrance gates. Other fan experience enhancements were added as the season progressed, whether it was a T-shirt-launching cannon shooting freebies into the crowd during breaks in play or free giveaways to fans coming through the gates.\n\nThe fervour shown by the fans, though, is something money can't buy. For anyone who thought MLC was going to be a one-and-done afterthought, think again.\n\nPeter Della Penna is ESPNcricinfo's USA correspondent @PeterDellaPenna",

    "body": "America’s very own T20 league, the Major League Cricket has been approved by USA Cricket, the American board confirmed via a statement.\n\nFollowing the inaugural MLC 2023 draft, a dispute between USA Cricket and the organisers had threatened Major League Cricket, but they seem to have found neutral ground now.\n\nUSA Cricket in the early hours of Friday released a statement confirming that Major League Cricket and Minor League Cricket, both have been sanctioned for the year 2023.\n\nIPL 2023 Points Table: Check Team Standings, Team Points, Wins, Losses & Orange Cap, Purple Cap\n\nThe statement from USA Cricket confirmed that they were working ‘diligently’ with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the organising body of the tournament having signed a 50-year commercial rights agreement with the American cricket board back in 2019.\n\n“USAC is pleased to announce the sanctioning of the Major League Cricket (MLC) and Minor League Cricket (MiLC) tournaments for 2023. Over the past few months, we have worked diligently with Ace to ensure that the MLC and MiLC are positioned well to support the growth of cricket in the United States,” read the statement.\n\n“We are pleased with Ace‘s commitment and best efforts to include all the current men’s national team players in the major league tournament. Additionally, we look forward to working with Ace to provide governance of the tournaments,” the statement informed further.\n\nPurple Cap: Check Out Full List for Top Bowlers in Purple Cap Race\n\nUSA Cricket also revealed that they will ‘review’ their relationship with Ace in the upcoming months.\n\n“Finally, we will review our commercial relationship with Ace over the next few months. We wish all the teams and players much success in this 2023 tournament,” read the statement further.\n\nAfter being sanctioned, both tournaments have been given green light, ICC, the global cricketing body had earlier deemed MLC and Minor League Cricket as “disapproved”.\n\nThe apex board also asked its member nations to not issue NOCs to their players to participate in either event, but after getting sanctioned, that stumbling block would also perish.\n\nIPL 2023: Orange Cap Complete List of Batters with Most Runs, Check here\n\nThe inaugural edition of the MLC will kick-start in July with the five franchises from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas, Seattle, Washington DC and New York set to take part. Four of the five franchises are also backed by IPL owners, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals.",

    "body": "It’s Faf du Plessis on strike as the famous Bollywood song Aaj ki party blares from the loudspeaker and a tantalising aroma of spices fills the air while the spectators — holding love for cricket in their hearts and biryani in their trays — roam around trying to get to their seats.\n\nThe setting has all the makings of a cricket match in India or Pakistan but if that’s your guess, you’ve got the geography completely wrong.\n\nIn the outskirts of Dallas, Texas lies a city named Grand Prairie that many have not heard of, and likewise is the town named Morrisville in North Carolina. One thing common between the two places is that they co-hosted United States’ first franchised T20 league, which came to an end on Monday with the victory of MI New York.\n\nCricket in the land of baseball, and that too at two lesser known venues could give sceptics the reason to doubt if the twin experiments would work. However, the heart pounding cricket encounters that displayed the determination of players to the electrifying music that resonated with the rhythm of the crowd, Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park turned cricket’s American dream into reality.\n\n“It is in our blood, us Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, cricket is in our blood,” said Swethan Srinivasan, executive committee member of Triangular Cricket League (TCL) in Morrisville.\n\nTCL is a non-profit organization that aims to promote the game in North Carolina among both adults and youth.\n\nIt started as a recreational league for adults to play cricket but now boasts multiple youth programs with a coaching staff that has produced many players for the U-19 national team in the US.\n\nIt also contributed to getting the Church Street Park facility built, which has hosted many notable events, including the 2018 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Americas Qualifiers and Minor League Cricket.\n\nSwethan, who is originally from Chennai and has been in the US for last sixteen years, works tirelessly as a volunteer to help cricket grow merely out of his love for the game that roots back to his time in his home country.\n\n“Everybody is a volunteer here and nobody gets paid except for some of our employed coaches. All the management and people who do other various things are volunteers.”\n\nThe love for cricket among South Asians runs deep and transcends boundaries, encompassing national pride, communal celebration, and a sense of identity that unites millions under one captivating bat and ball symphony.\n\n“I am supporting the team with Haris Rauf and Shadab Khan because I am very very Pakistani,” said Memhudah Rehman while holding a Pakistani flag during San Francisco Unicorns’ match against Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium on Tuesday.\n\nRehman, who is originally from Karachi, lives in Dubai and was in the US to visit her family in New York. They travelled all the way from the east coast to Texas only to watch an MLC match.\n\n“When I walked in here I got stunned; the vibe, the environment, the lighting, the stadium itself, there is (are) actually good pitches here, in America. I never thought I would see actual cricket pitches so it is really amazing and the turnout, it is not even the weekend night. It is crazy,” she said excitedly as flocks of people moved by.\n\nMLC is first of its kind T20 franchise marquee event in the country featuring six teams and numerous international stars including Rashid Khan, Andre Russell, Faf du Plessis, David Miller, Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Aaron Finch, Jason Roy, and many others.\n\nThe league is founded by Vijay Srinivasan and Sameer Mehta, co-founders of Willow TV, the largest broadcaster of cricket in North America.\n\n“We wanted to prove that the US is capable of holding and staging an event of this stature and scale and I think we have accomplished that,” said Vijay, who grew up in Delhi and migrated to the States in 1989 for his undergraduate studies.\n\nHe has been involved in cricket in the country for over twenty years now.\n\n“I grew up in India, playing cricket and watching cricket. It meant everything to me,” he said. “I have been very fortunate that I have been involved in cricket for a good part of my professional life through Willow and now through Major League Cricket and I’m very lucky that I have managed to make cricket part of my professional life and also my personal passion. Very few people are lucky that way.”\n\nThe businessman plans to grow the game in the US by bringing in international stars, building new stadiums and training facilities in hopes of growing domestic talent. The idea behind creating a cricket league in the US was also to bring the game closer to fans who never had the opportunity to watch their favorite stars here.\n\n“We have only managed to bring MLC to two cities so far but the response in both those cities has been amazing, and the fans have come out in huge numbers,” Vijay said. “We are really excited to bring this game here that so many fans love and have grown up.”\n\nHamza Khan, a 12-year-old from Austin who plays cricket for Hill County Cricket Association, was sporting Pakistan’s cricket team jersey at Grand Prairie Stadium to show his support for Shadab Khan.\n\nIt was his first time watching a cricket match in the US. He previously traveled to England in 2019 to watch his favourite players play in Edgbaston during ICC Men’s ODI World Cup.\n\n“I am very happy that I have a chance to actually watch a game and I do not have to go to a different country like I did for the other match,” the 7th grader said. “It is my favorite sport; I really enjoy watching it. Some of my favorite players are here today.”\n\nIt was Texas Super Kings (TSK), however, whose fans outnumbered the fans of all other franchises. The Yellow Army supported the home team not only in Dallas, but showed up in huge numbers in North Carolina as well in bright yellow jerseys and their signature buckets hats as they waved TSK flags.\n\nBut one could have wondered if it really was Texas they were supporting or the popular Chennai-based franchise from the Indian Premier League. The suspicions grew as even when David Miller smacked sixes off Adam Zampa and Sunil Narine in the opening game, the crowd was busy chanting “Dhoni, Dhoni”.\n\n“I am supporting TSK in the memory of MS Dhoni,” said Jisha Patel, who had come from Coppell to watch Texas play against MI New York with her family on Monday.\n\n“TSK is a part of CSK and Dhoni is a part of CSK so, me and family are really hoping that Dhoni would come and play for TSK,” said the 40-year-old, who was watching her first MLC match. “If Dhoni comes, I would not miss a match.”\n\nWhile the US is known for its diversity, there was not much of it on display during the ongoing T20 tournament. From the investors to the crowd, from team owners to the players, from food vendors to event officials, a vast majority of it was formed by the South Asian diaspora.\n\nAs this budding love affair continues, and cricket’s roots dig deeper into the American soil, one could hope for an even more vibrant community that brings people together regardless of their cultural background.",

    "date": "Wed Jul 19 12:00:00 2023",
    "body": "A few miles west of where Houston’s highway sprawl fades from a parade of superstores into the steamy low countryside, a slight rise in U.S. 290 reveals a surprise: six perfect circles of close-cropped grass clustered on the prairie like petals on an enormous flower. Here, spread across 86 acres and just an hour’s drive from the heart of the city, the nation’s largest and most advanced collection of cricket grounds attracts hundreds of athletes every week from around the Houston area—and often from around the country.\n\nThis is the Prairie View Cricket Complex, and on a recent Sunday, as the national junior cricket championships unfolded before him, the Texan who envisioned this place and paid to build it took a seat on the metal bleachers to explain how it all happened, and what it signified. Sporting mirrored aviator sunglasses, a body-hugging T-shirt, and a carefully groomed field of salt-and-pepper stubble, Tanweer Ahmed quickly rolled the clock back to 1988, when he arrived in this country from Pakistan at age twenty, with $23 to his name.\n\nHe’d come for the American dream but quickly realized there would be no handouts, he said. He took two jobs, one at a gas station and one at a Jack in the Box, and started learning English by watching American movies, especially The Terminator. He’d been working since he was ten years old back in Pakistan, selling vegetables from his family’s farm outside the city of Sialkot, and he’d managed to pay for two years of college there as well—so he was quick to impress his American bosses. By 1991 KFC hired Ahmed as a store manager. He was on his way.\n\nToday Ahmed, who lives in Houston, is one of the country’s largest fast-food franchise owners, with some four hundred KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell restaurants in four states. His passion, though, is cricket. And beginning about five years ago, he decided it was time to start paying his success forward—by investing heavily in the sport in Texas and building the Prairie View complex. “The whole idea that I have is, I came to this country, this country blessed me, and now I owe something back,” he told me.\n\nCricket is the world’s second-most-popular sport, Ahmed explained, with more than a billion fans, the vast majority of them from the Indian subcontinent. Meanwhile, Indians, Pakistanis, and other South Asians today make up the fastest-growing demographic group in the U.S., at 5.4 million strong. And Texas has the country’s second-largest South Asian population, just behind California and ahead of New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. The math wasn’t hard: cricket was wildly underrepresented in the nation’s landscape of recreational opportunities.\n\nAhmed’s complex in Prairie View is one of many in the U.S.—with a crucial but subtle difference. At the center of each circular field, under a rectangle of even finer turf, lies a layer of clay soil that has been rolled so flat and hard that a leather cricket ball will bounce as if on concrete—a differentiator from baseball because of how many variables this feature introduces to pitching and batting. Most of the other U.S. cricket grounds use artificial grass for the infield playing surface, a cost-saving measure that purists say just doesn’t offer the same quality of bounce. In Plano, Russell Creek Park claims to be the only park in the country with seven cricket fields, all with synthetic infields. Ahmed, ever the entrepreneur, saw an opportunity to level up.\n\nHe wasn’t the only Texas businessman to see an angle. Around the time Ahmed was starting his management career with KFC, another South Asian immigrant, Anurag Jain, was beginning business school at the University of Michigan. Jain, who moved to the U.S. from Chennai, India, when he was in his early twenties, had grown up as a talented but raw cricketer who dreamed of playing professionally but who instead followed his father’s advice to pursue a more sensible career.\n\nAs Jain earned an MBA and embarked upon a career as an entrepreneur in health-care IT, he fed his cricket addiction by getting up at three or four in the morning to watch live matches broadcast from the other side of the planet—a ritual shared by many of his South Asian peers in this country. “We’ve got this strange dual life where we’ve tried to keep in touch with cricket while we live our normal lives in the U.S.,” he told me. He longed to find his way back to the sport in a bigger way and loved the idea of building up American cricket—”but for the longest time it was just too much money.”\n\nThen Plano-based Perot Systems, an IT firm created by Ross Perot and his son, bought one of Jain’s first companies, Vision Healthsource, in 2003. Jain moved to the Dallas area, and he and Ross Perot Jr. began investing in other projects together. That was right as the sport of cricket itself began to change. Traditionally, a single match lasted five days, and even then it often didn’t result in a winner. A one-day format emerged in the 1970s, but it wasn’t until 2003 that another change allowed matches to be completed in three and a half hours—a format known as T20 cricket. The Indian Premier League debuted in 2008, and it quickly turned T20 matches into the kind of live television Western audiences are used to, complete with cheerleaders and Bollywood celebrity appearances. Seemingly overnight, a gentleman’s pursuit turned into a high-scoring bat-and-ball sport that made baseball look sleepy. “And that,” said Jain, “became the future of the sport.”\n\nBy the late 2010s, he and Ross Jr. had set up a venture capital firm, Perot Jain, and built a strong professional network in Silicon Valley. That’s where Jain found his opportunity: a start-up called Major League Cricket. Ahmed, as it turned out, discovered the same opportunity at about the same time.\n\nAs Ahmed and Jain were starting to dream of a thriving cricket culture in Texas, two tech entrepreneurs in the Bay Area, Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, were looking at the same trends and dreaming of a media and sports empire. They’d left their start-up jobs in the early aughts and launched a pay-TV channel dedicated to cricket. Willow TV, named for the type of wood in a cricket bat, didn’t become an immediate household name in the U.S., but it didn’t need to: by aggregating matches from around the world for Western audiences, the network turned the U.S. into the world’s fourth-largest cricket media market.\n\nThe number of talented cricketers emerging in India to play in the IPL had meanwhile started to outpace the number of opportunities in the league, and players began looking for jobs in other cricket-loving areas—Australia, the Caribbean, England, South Africa. That’s when Mehta and Srinivasan hit on the idea to start a professional league in the U.S., and Major League Cricket was born. They’d already proven a fan base existed here, so why not bring those supporters an original product? And if Major League Soccer could set its sights on eventually competing for attention with professional baseball and basketball, why not cricket?\n\nThe idea isn’t as far-fetched as it might sound. Cricket has a long history in the U.S. There’s even evidence of George Washington’s troops playing “wickets” at Valley Forge in 1778. That makes sense, because the sport spread with British imperialism as a way to inculcate British values in colonial subjects. Cricket faded in the U.S. in the late 1800s as baseball took hold, largely because the American game didn’t require the same kind of perfectly flattened and groomed turf. But now that so many new Americans come from India and other parts of the former British empire, there’s a natural symmetry to cricket’s contemporary return.\n\nAs word of Mehta and Srinivasan’s plan spread through the loose network of U.S.-based South Asian business leaders, it quickly found its way to Jain and Ahmed, both of whom signed on as investors in a $44 million round of funding by the league. Also piling money into MLC from its earliest days were Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Adobe Chairman and CEO Shantanu Narayan, and the principals of major venture-capital firms such as Madrona Venture Group and Rocketship VC.\n\nIt was a powerful group of people, all of whom brought their own considerable egos and financial ambitions, but all of whom also shared an underlying passion for the game that ran much deeper than the dollars at stake. “It’s sort of a badge of honor,” the league’s head of marketing, Tom Dunmore, told me. “American cricket is fortunate that many people who love it are immigrants who have come here and done well, and they can afford to invest in the sport or build a cricket pitch.” It’s different from soccer, he pointed out, because you can’t just whip up a game on any old playing surface. “But there’s a lot of community benefit that comes with setting up and maintaining cricket infrastructure.”\n\nEven with all of their competing interests, it didn’t take long for the league’s backers to zero in on Texas as MLC’s early center of gravity. Several of the most powerful investors were here—not just Ahmed and Jain, but also Ross Perot Jr., who signed on alongside his business partner and has a long history of doing business in India. There was also Ahmed’s complex in Prairie View, which the league decided to use as a training ground and a site for junior tournaments and other player-development projects. And there was the fact that moguls and teams from Seattle and San Francisco could fly to Texas for matches just as easily as those from New York and Washington, D.C.\n\nBut perhaps most important, when the league set out to find a stadium to host its first matches, it found the perfect site in Grand Prairie, the Dallas suburb sandwiched between Irving and Arlington, just south of Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport. A former independent league baseball stadium built in 2008 for the now-defunct Texas AirHogs, the grounds would require a substantial redesign and renovation, but that would cost half as much as constructing a new stadium. And the league quickly found that building in Texas is a lot easier than in, say, California. “The fact is, we get stuff done in Texas, and the regulators are helpful,” Jain said. “You can come here and within a year or two have all the permitting done and a stadium up and running. It’s so much easier to do business here, and you don’t realize that until you go other places.”\n\nOn an early June morning in Grand Prairie, just over a month before the opening day of MLC’s inaugural season, construction workers were preparing to pour concrete to form one of the last remaining sections of the stadium risers to be built, and another crew was repainting the VIP suites upstairs. (The season, which began July 13, will run as a two-week-long tournament, featuring eighteen total matches between six teams.) Out on the field, the central rectangular area—the pitch—was roped off to protect its turf, while sprinklers doused the sand covering the rest of the circular playing field. A shipment of sod would be showing up that afternoon, to be laid down on an eleven-inch-deep bed of highly specific sandy soil approved by the United States Golf Association, the nation’s reigning authority on sand for turf sports.\n\nDave Agnew, a tousle-haired Aussie who has built cricket pitches all over the world and whom MLC brought to Dallas to work full-time getting this one just right, oversaw the field work, while William Swann, another tall Australian, managed the entire $20 million construction project. Their jobs weren’t easy. Baseball and cricket share some obvious attributes—pitchers, batters, fielders—but the playing fields and surrounding structures are not easily transferable between the two sports. The entire stadium, save for the suites, had to be gutted to make room for the circular field. Where the baseball field had been two and a half acres, the new cricket surface is four. Even so, MLC managed to increase the stadium capacity from about five thousand to seven thousand fans.\n\nOn top of that, Russia invaded Ukraine a few weeks before work began last spring, and the resulting supply chain snarls slowed down plans from day one. A backup generator the crew ordered last summer had a 54-week lead time, meaning it should arrive just in time for the season. Meanwhile, a rainy spring this year has interrupted work days over and over. When all that expensive soil and sand turns to mud, concrete trucks can’t pass through the pitch to work on the stands for at least a few days.\n\nBut for all the potential construction snags, one of Swann’s biggest concerns was the relative paucity of luxury amenities and suites. “We have thirteen suites and two clubrooms, and once you go through the list of high–net worth individuals who will be coming, you quickly start to run out of suite space,” he said. Earlier this year, several teams from the Indian Premier League invested in MLC teams, and that introduced a whole new layer of wealth and influence to the mix. The New York MLC team, for instance, became MI New York, a reference to the Mumbai Indians, owned by the Indian oil conglomerate Reliance Industries, whose chairman, Mukesh Ambani, is Asia’s richest man and the world’s richest sports-team owner. The Dallas-based Texas Super Kings became affiliated with the Chennai Super Kings, a club owned by a powerful Indian cement company.\n\nAside from upgrading the furniture in the suites and updating the concessions to include samosas and roti wraps alongside hot dogs, there’s not much more Swann’s crew can do to accommodate the league’s VIPs. But the dilemma about adequate luxury space speaks to the size of the opportunity in U.S. cricket.\n\nOne of the most important areas of the stadium is an expanse of concrete on the concourse level that’s big enough to host sponsor activations—to show off a new car model, say. “You’ve got to pay the bills,” as Swann put it. The more built-in potential there is for sponsors, the more they’ll pay, the more the league can grow, and so on. The six teams competing this year (representing Los Angeles; New York; San Francisco; Seattle; Washington, D.C.; and Texas) will grow to eight at some point in the next few years, if all goes according to plan, with further goals of expansion down the line. Each franchise will ultimately want a home stadium. And once there are world-class cricket stadiums around the country, they can host international events. Already the 2024 T20 World Cup plans to hold some matches in Grand Prairie.\n\nAs Swann and Agnew talked field specs and growth opportunities, a young Sri Lankan woman who works in digital marketing for the league, Zayanya de Alwis, listened quietly and then interjected that the opportunity goes beyond cricket’s existing fan base. “We want the South Asian community to come out, but we also want to let American kids know about it,” she said. Where she lives, in the Bay Area, the younger generation is already “cricket mad,” she said, especially in the Silicon Valley corridor between San Francisco and San Jose, where practically every high school has a competitive cricket club. Here in North Texas, some public schools in Frisco have similar groups, but others aren’t there yet. As MLC builds out its infrastructure in Texas, de Alwis has started reaching out to more schools and groups such as the Grand Prairie ISD phys ed teachers and the Grand Prairie Police Department, which puts on sports-focused summer camps.\n\nYouth cricket may represent the future of American cricket, but the sport also needs adult fans now. One of the boldest projects on that front is taking shape about thirty miles north of the stadium, at Grandscape, a sprawling shopping mall and entertainment complex in the Denton County suburb the Colony. Here, just across a sidewalk from an indoor go-karting palace and something called the Puttery (“immersive, adults-only mini golf, craft cocktails, and upscale eats”), the first American location of Sixes Social Cricket, a new kind of sports bar, opened last month.\n\nInside, a row of electric-orange batting cages and scoreboards flanks a bar and restaurant area. Diners choose from sandwiches such as the Delhi Smasher (chicken with Indian seasonings) and the Sri Lankan Fielder (a veggie burger) while taking turns batting against virtual bowlers (pitchers) who hurl balls from large video screens at the far end of each fenced-in cage. Purple, green, orange, and blue stripes cover every surface of the room, in varying sizes and orientations. “We were going for that Paul Smith look,” the company’s cofounder and CEO, Calum Mackinnon, told me. “But also, we want people to walk in here and go, ‘What’s going on?’ If people don’t do that, we haven’t done a good enough job.”\n\nOne afternoon a couple weeks before the grand opening, Mackinnon, who previously ran a small chain of Scottish restaurants in the United Kingdom, took a break from final preparations to demonstrate his bar’s game technology. As a Scotsman, he hadn’t grown up with cricket (“It’s really more of an English thing,” he said), but he’d found himself drawn to the growing trend of so-called social-entertainment restaurants—places like the Puttery and Topgolf. After a concept for a whiskey bar with virtual hunting failed to take off because of COVID-19 disruptions, he turned his attention to cricket. “And as soon as we opened this in the UK, the feedback was overwhelming,” Mackinnon said. “We got more than four hundred franchise requests from all over the world in just a year and a half.” With eight locations in the UK up and running and with MLC starting up here, opening in the Dallas suburbs felt like a natural next step.\n\nIn cricket, the term “six” is the equivalent of a home run in baseball, and the batting cages at Sixes register where players hit the ball and assign scores accordingly. After a couple of whiffs, Mackinnon hit a six. “It’s not like baseball, where the ball’s flying at you a hundred miles an hour,” he said. “People can pick this up relatively quickly, and it’s all about getting points, getting people competitive.” Typically, he said, people get better with a few drinks in them. “My sweet spot is four or five pints. Then it goes remarkably downhill quite fast.”\n\nHe’s in close contact with MLC, and he said a couple of his batting cages would eventually end up in the Grand Prairie stadium as amenities for fans and marketing vehicles for the restaurant. But ultimately, “we don’t really market to the cricketers,” he said. “The cricketers will find us. There’s such a huge South Asian population around here, they’ll be excited and bring their noncricketing friends, and that will create positive momentum.” He’d seen it work already in the UK: “Eighty percent of the people that come to Sixes there have never played cricket before.”\n\nBack at Tanweer Ahmed’s Prairie View Cricket Complex, out on Field 5, a sixteen-year-old player named Aarin Nadkarni sprinted from the far edge of the round field toward the center, where a batter stood at one end of a rectangular strip in front of the wicket, a formation of three sticks in the ground with two smaller sticks balanced across the top of them. As he reached the far end of the rectangle, Nadkarni windmilled his outstretched right arm overhead in a violently fast circle and released a leather ball, smaller and harder than a baseball. His whole body pitched forward with his momentum, a mane of wavy black hair bouncing around the edges of his yellow ball cap as he braked to a stop and the batter took a swing.\n\nIt was the penultimate game of a weekend-long tournament that’s part of the MLC under-seventeen cricket championships, and Aarin’s Houston-based MSCA Hurricanes were facing a squad from New Jersey. In T20 cricket, each team gets one turn at bat and another fielding. The Houston boys batted the first half of this match, scoring a respectable 164 runs, and now it was time to try to hold their opponents to fewer. Aarin, his coach told me from the sideline, is one of the country’s top young fast bowlers (essentially a pitcher with a mean fastball), and the strategy today was to bowl aggressively from the outset to neutralize the opposing team’s top two or three batters early.\n\nThe Houston coach, Sushil Nadkarni, is also Aarin’s dad. Like Jain and Ahmed, he came to this country as a young man, in his case from the Indian city of Pune in 1999, to pursue a master’s degree at Texas A&M–Kingsville. After grad school, Nadkarni began a career doing environmental-impact management for a multinational consulting firm with clients in the oil and gas industry. He also played competitive cricket. He’d been an elite youth player in India, even making the under-nineteen national team, and he quickly came to dominate the American cricket scene, becoming captain of Team USA and the best batter in the sport’s domestic history, with a practically unfathomable batting average of 51.3 percent. “The next highest was thirty-six,” he offered proudly.\n\nBetween bites of a taco for lunch in the bleachers, Nadkarni kept one eye on his team as he described how he started Master Strokes Cricket America, the first training academy of its kind in the Houston area, in a Katy strip mall in 2015. Today there are dozens of academies around Texas’s biggest cities, Nadkarni said—“one on every corner” in some areas. At MSCA, players learn batting and bowling skills and work on physical conditioning.\n\nIt’s the kind of training Nadkarni received in India, and it wasn’t available in this country until recently. On the field, the quality of cricket the boys play here isn’t quite up to the level of equivalent Indian or Pakistani teams, Nadkarni said, but it’s not far off. The difference is not the amount of raw talent here. “It’s the amount of cricket played,” he explained. “In India they’re playing three or four games a week.” It’s just a part of the culture there, in the way that kids play basketball or soccer here.\n\nFor now, as cricket remains a niche sport, playing seriously is an expensive proposition for young athletes. Many of the players come from white-collar families. It costs a thousand dollars to attend a good academy for a year, plus another thousand or two in various tournament fees. Then there’s expensive gear to buy and the cost of family trips for travel tournaments. “It’s easily twenty or twenty-five thousand dollars a year,” Nadkarni said—and unlike many other sports, that doesn’t currently come with the potential payoff of a college scholarship.\n\nFor Aarin Nadkarni, who grew up in a cricket household and watches all the cricket he can on Willow, the start of Major League Cricket holds up the possibility that he could have a bright future in the sport in this country—without having to moonlight, as his dad always did. In addition to youth competitions, MLC also runs a set of minor league teams, and both efforts aim specifically to develop the next generation of pros. While most of the major league players will be foreign nationals, franchises are required to maintain a minimum number of U.S. residents on their rosters, with plans to also maintain dedicated slots for younger players. Aarin hopes to be one of the first to enter that pipeline, though he’s planning to go to college as a backstop.\n\nA second-generation immigrant in suburban Houston, Aarin is every bit as Texan as he is Indian. He follows football and basketball, but rather than getting pulled away from cricket toward those American pastimes, he has found space for all three in his life, and he sees a similar blending of cultures happening among his peers as cricket becomes increasingly baked into life in the States. “Almost all of our parents are immigrants, and we consider ourselves American,” he said. “But we think cricket is a good sport. It’s just a part of me.”\n\nAarin’s team lost the game that afternoon in Prairie View—he successfully bowled out two of the most dangerous New Jersey batsmen, but the third got the better of him. “He was the highest run scorer in the tournament and ended up taking the match away from us,” Aarin said later. The Hurricanes lost again the next day playing a team from North Carolina. The Houston boys entered the weekend ranked first of the thirty teams playing and, despite the losses, ended up still in the top four based on the tournament’s scoring system. It was the first of three tournaments that will eventually crown the MLC youth national champions in December.\n\nAhmed believes playing cricket teaches important values. “You can’t have a gentleman’s game without patience and discipline,” he said. And self-reliance. “Whereas you can hide yourself on a soccer team, you cannot hide here. You will be exposed in a second.” (It also appears that knocking rival sports as lesser pursuits is one of fandom’s universal values.) He sees parallels between success on the pitch and his own bootstrapped fortune, and he worries that immigrant new Texans today lack the same drive. “The people who are coming over here now are different,” he said. “They believe you can pluck dollars off a tree and get rich overnight.”\n\nIt’s a belief that only furthers his commitment to building out a cricket culture in Houston. And, lately, Ahmed has considered entering politics. Ever since he met former U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo at an event last year, he’s begun spending time in Palm Beach, Florida, with Republican lawmakers and former Trump administration officials, whom he says are recruiting him to run for Congress.\n\nRegardless of that project, he’s working to make sure one of MLC’s first expansion teams lands in Houston, within the next five years. He’d originally wanted the Texas team there, close to his cricket complex, but the stadium opportunity in Grand Prairie—and Jain’s influence in Dallas and slightly larger ownership stake in the league—proved insurmountable. Between MLC, hosting next year’s T20 World Cup, and cricket becoming an Olympic sport in 2028, when the games will be held in Los Angeles, Ahmed believes, the U.S. will emerge as one of the premier cricket nations in the world.\n\nAfter the Hurricanes’ tournament game back in June ended and players started trickling away, Ahmed stopped one of them to chat—a fifteen-year-old named Danyal Bhagani, whose eighteen-year-old brother, Rayaan, plays on the Houston minor league team and is one of the best hopes for a local breakout cricketer, along with Aarin Nadkarni.\n\n“You see that?” Ahmed said to me after hearing how many runs the boy scored and wishing him good luck and hard work for the next day. “They moved here, he and his brother, two years ago from L.A. because of this.” He gestured around at the dream fields he had built, at the long stretch of highway frontage that functions as free advertising. Players were moving here to train at Sushil’s academy and be close to the country’s best cricket complex. Teams were flying in from the coasts to compete against them. “We can do a lot with this,” he said.\n\nA few weeks later, the temperature was 103 in Grand Prairie when Ross Perot Jr. bowled the ceremonial first ball of the first match of Major League Cricket. Outside the sold-out stadium, hundreds of frustrated fans stood in line for more than an hour to pass through a security bottleneck, and a police officer hurried to help someone who’d fainted in the heat.",

The ballpark would be designed to host Major League Cricket matches, Mason baseball games, and other events on the University’s Fairfax Campus in the Washington D.C. region.\n\nFunding support for the study and plan development comes from Govil, a founding investor in MLC, the Founder and Chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions and the CEO of Zyter. The effort represents part of MLC’s long-term strategic plan for American cricket, which also includes the launch of the first U.S. professional Twenty20 cricket league.\n\nWith a goal to be operational by Summer 2025, the ballpark at Mason would be home to an MLC franchise in the heart of one of the largest cricket-loving populations in the United States and feature an international-grade pitch. The pitch would meet International Cricket Council (ICC) accreditation and allow the ballpark to host the highest level of international cricket competition.\n\n“This study with Mason is an important milestone in a new era for Major League Cricket and international matches in the United States and brings new athletic resources to George Mason University and the region,” said Govil. “We look forward to taking the next steps to fully realize a vision for the first international cricket venue in the northeastern United States.”\n\n“Mason is the educational, economic and cultural hub of one of the most dynamic regions in the country and is the most diverse public university in Virginia,” Mason President Gregory Washington said. “This opportunity would bring the second-most popular global media sport to the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and base it at a location known for attracting international students and audiences. At the same time, this proposed facility would enhance the Mason athletic experience for our student-athletes, alumni network, and fan base.”\n\nMason’s main campus is located in Fairfax County, VA, home to more than one million people, with a thriving global community and adult and youth cricket leagues which provide a significant base of grassroots support for cricket in the area.\n\nIn collaboration with Mason on an innovative cross-functional design that would maximize facility utilization, MLC is working with internationally renowned architects HKS, one of the nation’s leading architecture firms which is developing multiple cricket stadium concepts for MLC nationwide.\n\n“Major League Cricket is grateful to George Mason University for working with us to plan an innovative facility that can maximize use for the venue during the college season for Mason baseball and then host world class cricket in the summer months,” said Sameer Mehta, co-founder, Major League Cricket.\n\nMEDIA CONTACTS\n\nTom Dunmore tom@majorleaguecricket.com\n\nJohn Hollis jhollis2@gmu.edu\n\nMaureen Nasser mnasser@gmu.edu\n\nABOUT MAJOR LEAGUE CRICKET\n\nMajor League Cricket will be the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States.

    "title": "America’s Major League Cricket Debut Surpassed Expectations On And Off The Field",
    "date": "Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Having \"exceeded all expectations\", with stirring contests in front of heaving crowds helping surpass its financial targets, the historic Major League Cricket has the foundations to build on as it eyes an expanded second season.\n\nThe debut of the well-heeled T20 tournament, as cricket seriously enters the world's biggest sports market, was deemed a resounding success. Even no nonsense Sunil Gavaskar, the Indian cricket legend and broadcaster at the MLC, was left impressed.\n\n\"He (Gavaskar) told me the quality of the cricket was high,\" Anand Rajaraman, San Francisco Unicorns co-owner, told me. \"He felt the international players were giving it their all and that the pitches were good, which is a ringing endorsement.\n\n\"The overseas players said the ground and pitch in Dallas was as good as anywhere they've played around the world.\n\n\"The tournament exceeded all expectations.\"\n\nThere was much anticipation over the MLC's launch with a lot riding on it considering the maligned status of American cricket over the years.\n\nWith over $100 million invested, aided by influential Indian businessmen some of whom are ensconced in Silicon Valley, the six-team tournament was able to lure high-profile international cricketers through attractive salaries.\n\nWith the U.S. home to a growing South Asian populace, there were plenty of passionate cricket fans eager to watch the matches in person even though some of the matches were rather bafflingly played in the sweltering Dallas heat.\n\nMore than 70,000 fans turned out to the 18-day tournament played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the rather modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThe broadcast was beamed to 87 countries worldwide and importantly some games were shown live on CBS Sports Network in the U.S.\n\n\"The tournament had revenues of around $8 million,\" said Rajaraman, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. \"Was more than we anticipated...we thought it would be lucky to make $5 million in the first season.\n\n\"We had a lot of sponsors reaching out. It was a success but there are learnings. Scheduling afternoon games was not ideal, they were hard to sell.\"\n\nThe MLC has been debriefing its first season with the tournament expected to announce its plans for the 2024 edition in the coming months.\n\nThe emotion from tournament administrators was understandable relief, knowing the tournament had lived up to the hype and avoided being the type of fool's gold project long associated with the tempestuous American cricket scene.\n\nBut there is much to work out before a defining second season hot on the heels of the landmark T20 World Cup in June, which will be co-hosted by the U.S. with matches played in New York, Dallas and Florida.\n\nA proper home and away season, where teams play each other twice, is on the cards, while there is hope the salary cap for the teams will rise, further enticing cricketers many of whom are already intrigued by playing on the big sports stage of the U.S.\n\nThere is an unknown over player drafts and movements, with those playing in the first edition having signed one-year contracts with options to extend.\n\n\"The ownership group in the MLC would like the next season to be a full season, but scheduling will be important,\" Rajaraman said. \"It will have to be after the T20 World Cup but not impact other (T20) leagues in August.\n\n\"It should last around a month and would need double headers, but hopefully not too many games played in the heat.\"\n\nAs expected, the tournament relied on the star power from its overseas signings to ensure the matches felt pretty similar in standard to most of the other T20 leagues cramming the cricket calendar.\n\nTeams were allowed six overseas players per starting eleven - more than the quota of four accepted in established leagues. Amid an outcry, fearing the sanctity of international cricket, governing body the ICC has tightened regulations with teams in official T20 leagues only allowed to field four overseas players.\n\nThis new rule does not come into effect for the MLC or the newly formed cashed-up UAE league, but there is an understanding that homegrown heroes need to be created for the tournament to truly resonate amongst the local populace.\n\n\"We have to get to four,\" Rajaraman said. \"There is no discussion on timeframe, it will probably be six to five to four. It (four) is the right place to be.\n\n\"It was amazing for the domestic players, exposure many had never dreamed of having. They will be much better for the experience.\"\n\nTo grow the tournament beyond a South Asian audience, as these newly formed franchises fight for air amid the congested American sports market, teams will need home grounds in a bid to build a connection with their communities.\n\nSignificant infrastructure is required, a daunting task given cricket is played on bigger grounds than baseball and requiring a pitch in the middle. For the Unicorns, a stadium in Santa Clara is in the works, but a temporary venue could be used next season.\n\n\"We had a fan event before the MLC in Freemont on the east bay and we had over 1200 people show up,\" Rajaraman said. \"We organized some watch parties in bars in the Bay Arena, there was an enthusiastic showing.\n\n\"Clearly there is interest and we are confident if we do have home games in the Bay Area, we would sell them out. Easily.\"\n\nExpectations will inevitably rise further, but there is little concern over complacency creeping in with everyone knowing the daunting task ahead with cricket desperate for visibility in its favored target market.\n\n\"We were just holding our breath on this tournament,\" Rajaraman said. \"We got this tournament to where we thought we would get to in the second or third year.\n\n\"There was a novelty factor in the first season, which won't be there in the second season. We have to consciously build on what we've started.\"",

He also picked up 90 wickets.\n\n“It’s been a huge honour and (I am) extremely proud to represent New Zealand,” Anderson, who holds the record for the fastest ODI century for his 36-ball innings against West Indies in 2013, was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.\n\nHis 36-ball hundred against West Indies on New Year’s Day in 2014, was the fastest ODI hundred for a year before AB de Villiers’ broke the record with a 31-ball feat against the same opposition.\n\nAnderson lamented that he couldn’t play more internationals for his country.\n\n“I would have loved to have achieved and played more but just is what it is sometimes, and different opportunities arise and send you in a direction you never thought would be a possibility. Very appreciative for everything that NZC has done for me.”\n\nAnderson also played in the IPL for Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore and also was a part of New Zealand’s runners-up finish at the 2015 World Cup.\n\nHowever, his career was affected by multiple injuries, including a spate of stress fractures, groin injuries and chronic back issues. He last played a T20I for New Zealand in November 2018.\n\n“It hasn’t been an easy decision. I asked myself several questions. What do I want to do now or what do I want to achieve in the next two years, five years, 10 years?” he said.\n\n“As you get older you think about life a little bit more broadly as well. And obviously, my fiance, Mary Margaret, who’s born and raised in America, she’s had a massive part to play in that because she’s sacrificed so much for me.\n\n“So, when the opportunity arose, we thought that living in America is the best thing, not only for my cricket, but it’s, it’s the best thing for both of us in general as well.”\n\nAnderson recently featured in the Caribbean Premier League for the Barbados Tridents in August.",

    "body": "The Major Cricket League has finally kicked off in the USA. The inaugural season of professional cricket, which has been sparking talks of a cricket revolution in the baseball-loving country, will see players from around the world come together under one roof to play 19 matches for the title. But the event is more than just cricket. From the likes of Satya Nadella claiming a stake in the games to AI recreating Indian flavours for the stands, there’s a lot going on behind the scenes. Here are six things you should know about the Major Cricket League (MLC):\n\nWhere is the MLC being played?\n\nAll 19 of these T20 matches will be played over at the newly-constructed Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. The Grand Prairie Stadium was originally a baseball ground. But the venue has now been renovated with 7,200 seats and a grass wicket to serve as a cricket stadium. The MLC 2023 championship is the first-ever cricket event to be hosted at the venue. Formerly home to the minor league baseball Texas AirHogs, it’s now one of the largest complex of cricket fields in the United States.\n\nCricket in the US… is it really a big deal?\n\nWith a sizable audience in its South Asian community, Texas is already witnessing a sold-out game. Cricket-loving diaspora, including Indian investors, make up for a majority of team-owners in the league. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella co-owns the Seattle Orcas, and is one of the major investors alongside Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan. Even before this, the state has had ample cricket activity, from Minor League Cricket events to Houston Women’s Opens. North Carolina is also a breeding ground for cricket enthusiasts, and regularly hosts Minor League Cricket at its cricket stadium in Morrisville.\n\nShould you expect the good old hot dog stand?\n\nFor MLC 2023, food startup CloudChef is using Artificial Intelligence to record and recreate Indian recipes, and will serve chef Saransh Goila’s Goila Butter Chicken fries, kebabs from chef Sherry Mehta and other dishes prepared by chefs like Thomas Zacharias. How? Movements of the chefs at work are fed into an AI model (with inputs from cameras, thermal sensors and other devices), which comes back with a programme that chefs at a cloud kitchen anywhere in the world can follow to create the exact same dish and flavours without the chefs having to do it themselves.\n\nWho’s playing?\n\nMLC 2023 is modelled on the Indian Premier League, and in fact, four of the six teams are owned by franchises of IPL–MI New York (Mumbai Indians), Texas Super Kings (Chennai Super Kings), LA Knight Riders (Kolkata Knight Riders) and the Seattle Orcas (Delhi Capitals). The other two teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom.\n\nEach team can have 16 to 19 member players, with at least one under-23 domestic player. The 110 players, in total, are a mix of international champions, including prominent names in Indian cricket such as Unmukt Chand and Sunil Narine. Also look out for former South Africa skipper Faf Du Plessis, Rashid Khan, Aaron Finch, Trent Boult and Jason Roy.\n\nWhat’s the schedule for the MLC?\n\nThe first eight matches are being played in Texas, after which the season will move to North Carolina. The playoffs and the final will be played in Texas. For the full schedule as per Indian Standard Time, head here.\n\nYou can watch MLC livestream from here in India",

Spanning 18 days, the inaugural MLC season will feature 19 total matches between teams representing Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Seattle and New York City.\n\n“Next summer, the eyes of world cricket will be on the launch of Major League Cricket, with the stars of the game competing over three weeks of fast-paced T20 action,” Justin Geale, MLC Tournament Director, was quoted saying in the announcement. “The launch of MLC will transform American cricket and provide one of the best platforms in the sport for the world’s most elite players to showcase their skills while also fast-tracking the development of domestic talent to feature in the league.”\n\nThe 18 day window likely means good news for those hoping to see big International stars play in Major League Cricket. With the southern hemisphere in the middle of winter, and the International calendar fairly free, aside from the Ashes in England, fans can begin to speculate realistically about the stars they want to see playing alongside American domestic cricketers, who now have two years of Minor League Cricket behind them.\n\nThe Grand Prairie venue, currently under major reconstruction totalling $20 million, was once the home of the minor league baseball Texas Air Hogs, and is set to open in the spring of 2023 with a capacity of 7,200. Construction has commenced, and a ceremony today marks the installation of the playing pitch. The new cricket specific stadium will feature 1,000 club and premium seats, with the ability to expand capacity to 15,000 for major events. Grand Prairie will likely be a featured venue in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024, which will be staged in the United States and Caribbean.\n\nRecently hired MLC curator David Agnew has been tasked with creating the playing field and pitch at Grand Prairie. Agnew’s resume includes time curating Seddon Park in New Zealand, working in the Caribbean Premier League, both renditions of Canada’s Global T20, and building the pitch square at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina ahead of the 2018 ICC Americas T20 World Cup Qualifier.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium will serve as the primary venue for the inaugural season of Major League Cricket, and will be the home of the Dallas MLC franchise going forward. MLC has retained HKS as project architects. The firm was involved in the design of Super Bowl LVI site SoFi Stadium, AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, and Optus Stadium in Perth, Australia, which recently hosted India vs South Africa in the 2022 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. Manhattan Construction Company, builders of AT&T Stadium and Texas Rangers home venue Globe Life Field, is managing the construction.\n\nGrand Prairie Mayor, Ron Jensen, was quoted in the announcement, saying “Grand Prairie Stadium will be the best cricket venue in the United States upon its completion. This venue will be a huge asset to the Grand Prairie community, bringing Major League Cricket, international cricket and potentially the 2024 ICC T20 Men’s World Cup to Grand Prairie allowing fans here to experience a world class sport in action.”\n\nThe team name of the Dallas franchise and the other five franchises will be announced in early 2023, along with any additional venues. MLC have previously announced plans for a 10,000 seat stadium in Irvine, California, in partnership with Shah Rukh Khan, and have secured exclusive negotiating rights with Santa Clara County, with their sights set on building in San Jose.\n\nTwo seasons of Minor League Cricket have preceded the launch of the Major League, featuring 26 teams, coast to coast, and 200 games per season, spanning ten weeks. The unprecedented scale and length of Minor League Cricket should help prepare MLC selectors for drafting the best domestic talent on offer.",

At every Olympics, the IOC allows the host city to select a few sports unique to its own sports culture.\n\nTangent\n\nFlag football is a variation of American football, the most popular sport in the U.S., and the NFL was involved in the sport’s bid. Additionally, the U.S. is set to co-host the 2024 Twenty20 Cricket World Cup alongside the West Indies, and in July, Major League Cricket, a startup attempting to bring the hugely popular sport to the U.S., completed its inaugural championship in Texas. Baseball (which, along with softball, was invented in the U.S.) has been showcased prominently in the World Baseball Classic, an international event that, with 1.3 million attendees, saw its highest ever attendance in March during the 2023 iteration of the event.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThe move to add cricket comes amid growing desire to tap into the Indian market, where cricket is the most popular sport.

    "body": "United States of America is one of the best sporting nations in the world and has undoubtedly produced some of the greatest athletes of all time. Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Kobe Bryant in Basketball, Michael Phelps (the player with the highest number of Olympic Gold medal) in swimming, and Tiger Woods in Golf and Tom Brady in American Football, all have dominated their respective sports by miles. The reason to this is the massive sporting industry the United States is and the sporting league system that exists there. The National Basketball League (NBA), the Major League Soccer (MLS) for Football, The National Football League (NFL) are some of the biggest sporting leagues in the world in terms of revenue they generate. But in a country like the USA, where sports is a major part of their economy and culture, we need to ask the question of Why has cricket, the second biggest sport in the world not a big sport in the country and how is it growing in the nation.\n\nCredit: Olympics\n\nAlso Read: Football vs Cricket\n\nIn this article by ZAP, we will decode this reason and know more about the Major League Cricket T20 (MLC T20), America’s first T20 Cricket League.\n\nWhat is the Major League Cricket (MLC)?\n\nThe sporting environment in the United States has been undergoing a dramatic change in the last few years. While sports like Basketball, American Football, Golf and Hockey have dominated the stage for many years, there has been a shift in sporting paradigm in the country. As a lot of people from the subcontinent live in the States, there’s a clear cult following of cricket in the country. Also, Virat Kohli is one of the biggest sportsman in the world, the third most followed sportsman on Instagram, has created a following in the US too. And finally, the rise of cricket and the T20 format, the most entertaining cricket format throughout the world, too has had a huge impact on this shift. Club this all together, and you get a new age T20 Cricket League, the Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nAlso Read: How to play Cricket Like a Pro | Cricket Rules\n\nCredit: AugustMan\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) is a new professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in the United States. This professional league is ushering in a new era for cricket in America and is backed by some of the biggest names in the sport, including some team owners of the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nMajor Cricket League History:\n\nPrior attempts to create T20 cricket leagues in the United States, such as Pro Cricket in 2004(just a single season) and the American Premier League (no seasons played) proved to be unproductive and very short lived, but laid the groundwork for Major League Cricket in the country.\n\nWith important partners including The Times Group and Willow TV founders, American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) was able to acquire a $1 billion investment for the league in 2019. This was a significant step towards materialization of the idea of the league. After receiving financing from Indian Premier League giants Kolkata Knight Riders. A proper youth league system and development programmes were set up to create a growing cricketing infrastructure.\n\nThe league's original launch was postponed until 2023 as a result of COVID-19 and stadium construction delays. MLC raised $120 million in fundraising in 2022 from well-known investors like Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft.\n\nThe MLC revealed plans in November 2022 for its first season, which would take place in July 2023 and include six franchises in a round-robin style. Despite early doubts about the league's legitimacy, the player draft was held in March 2023, and on April 13, 2023, the International Cricket Council (ICC) formally approved the league, enabling it to start operations.\n\nMajor League Cricket Teams and Owners:\n\nThe MLC Tournament 2023 started with 6 teams with the ACE managing all teams, but they were owned by the people and companies that had invested in the league. The Los Angeles Knight Riders were owned by KKR owners Knight Riders Group, MI New York is owned by Mumbai Indians owner Indiawin Sports, Seattle Orcas are owned by Delhi Capitals owners GMR Group and Microsoft CEO and Texas Super Kings is owned by the Chennai Super Kings owners along with Anurag Jain and Ross Perot Jr.\n\nTwo other teams San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom are owned by other owners.\n\nCredit: The Times of India\n\nTeam\n\nOwners\n\nCaptain\n\nCoach\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nKnight Riders Group\n\nSunil Narine\n\nPhil Simmons\n\nMI New York\n\nIndiawin Sports\n\nKieron Pollard\n\nRobin Peterson\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nAnand Rajaraman, Venky Harinarayan\n\nAaron Finch\n\nShane Watson\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nGMR Group, Satya Nadella\n\nWayne Parnell\n\nPravin Amre\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nChennai Super Kings, Anurag Jain, Ross Perot Jr.\n\nFaf du Plessis\n\nStephen Fleming\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSanjay Govil\n\nMoises Henriques\n\nGreg Shipperd\n\nMajor League Cricket Teams and Squads:\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nMI New York\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSunil Narine (c)\n\nKieron Pollard (c)\n\nAaron Finch (c)\n\nWayne Parnell (c)\n\nFaf du Plessis (c)\n\nMoises Henriques (c)\n\nAli Khan\n\nSteven Taylor\n\nCorey Anderson\n\nHarmeet Singh\n\nRusty Theron\n\nAndries Gous\n\nUnmukt Chand\n\nHammad Azam\n\nLiam Plunkett\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nCalvin Savage\n\nMukhtar Ahmed\n\nJaskaran Malhotra (wk)\n\nEhsan Adil\n\nTajinder Singh\n\nShubham Ranjane\n\nLahiru Milantha\n\nObus Pienaar\n\nNitish Kumar\n\nNosthush Kenjige\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi\n\nCameron Gannon\n\nMilind Kumar\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar\n\nCorne Dry\n\nMonank Patel (wk)\n\nCarmi Le Roux\n\nAaron Jones\n\nSami Aslam\n\nSaad Ali\n\nAli Sheikh\n\nSarabjit Ladda\n\nBrody Couch\n\nNauman Anwar\n\nCameron Stevenson\n\nDane Piedt\n\nSaif Badar\n\nShayan Jahangir (wk)\n\nDavid White\n\nPhani Simhadri\n\nCody Chetty\n\nSujith Gowda\n\nShadley van Schalkwyk\n\nKyle Phillip\n\nSmit Patel (wk)\n\nAngelo Perera\n\nZia Shahzad\n\nJustin Dill\n\nBhaskar Yadram\n\nSaideep Ganesh\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nMatthew Tromp\n\nSaiteja Mukkamalla\n\nAkhilesh Bodugum\n\nAndre Russell\n\nTrent Boult\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nMitchell Marsh\n\nDevon Conway\n\nWanindu Hasaranga\n\nJason Roy\n\nRashid Khan\n\nLungi Ngidi\n\nQuinton de Kock (wk)\n\nMitchell Santner\n\nAnrich Nortje\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nTim David\n\nMatthew Wade (wk)\n\nDasun Shanaka\n\nDaniel Sams\n\nMarco Jansen\n\nMartin Guptill\n\nDewald Brevis\n\nQais Ahmad\n\nSikandar Raza\n\nDavid Miller\n\nGlenn Phillips\n\nAdam Zampa\n\nDavid Wiese\n\nFinn Allen\n\nAndrew Tye\n\nGerald Coetzee\n\nAdam Milne\n\nRilee Rossouw\n\nKagiso Rabada\n\nMackenzie Harvey\n\nHeinrich Klaasen\n\nDwayne Bravo\n\nJosh Philippe\n\nSpencer Johnson\n\nNicholas Pooran\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nIzharulhaq Naveed\n\nAmbati Rayudu\n\nBen Dwarshuis\n\nGajanand Singh\n\nJason Behrendorff\n\nShadab Khan\n\nDwaine Pretorius\n\nMohammad Mohsin\n\nAkeal Hosein\n\nJasdeep Singh\n\nAmila Aponso\n\nNisarg Patel\n\nImran Tahir\n\nUsman Rafiq\n\nTristan Stubbs\n\nShimron Hetmyer\n\nTanveer Sangha\n\nImad Wasim\n\nMatthew Short\n\nReason For Major League Cricket (MLC) Tournament Success:\n\nCredit: The Indian Express\n\nExceeding All Expectations:\n\nBaseball was the only sport similar to cricket in America, but had a lot of differences. Different grounds and pitch conditions and comepletely different rules. But, the MLC smashed through all the doubts, creating a huge infrastructure for cricket stadium and training ground, with the pitch conditions at the grounds too extremely suitable for a cricket match.\n\nHigh Investments and Attractive Salaries:\n\nWith over $100 million invested and support from influential Indian businessmen, MLC managed to attract high-profile international cricketers through lucrative salaries. This financial backing and strong incentives played a crucial role in making the league a success.\n\nMassive Fan Turnout:\n\nThe tournament witnessed massive fan turnouts, with over 70,000 fans attending matches played in two venues, Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. The growing South Asian population in the U.S. contributed to the passionate fan base.\n\nImpressive Revenues:\n\nThe tournament generated approximately $8 million in revenues, surpassing initial expectations. The success attracted numerous sponsors, indicating the potential for future growth.",

There is some anxiety from league organisers as to whether Pakistan players will be granted visas, though that is not believed to be a serious obstacle.\n\nRelated\n\nMLC wants more England cricketers, but not to 'start a war with anyone'\n\nDu Plessis, Conway, Santner, Rayudu reunite with coach Fleming at Texas Super Kings\n\nMLC gets official ICC sanction ahead of July launch this year\n\nRoy agrees termination of ECB incremental contract to play in MLC\n\nA more pressing obstacle to their potential participation will be the nature and, indeed, fate of Pakistan's July commitment in Sri Lanka. That series is currently a two-Test World Test Championship series which overlaps with MLC - the league takes place from July 13-30 at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. There is speculation that series may turn into an ODI series as preparation for the World Cup. If so the two centrally contracted players will likely not be able to play in the US as they would be required to appear for Pakistan.\n\nAny appearance by Pakistani players would be significant because they have missed out on the two other big leagues launched in the UAE and South Africa, both with significant IPL franchise ownership. The ostensible reason for their absence from the ILT20 and the SA20 was because of a busy international home season for their top players. But there were also suggestions at the time that IPL franchise owners were reluctant to pick Pakistani players because of strained political ties between India and Pakistan - Pakistani players have not featured in the IPL since the inaugural season.\n\nFour of the six MLC franchises have investors who own or co-own IPL teams, while Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales have stakes in the other two.\n\nEach franchise has a salary cap of $1.15 million and several leading international players - including Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje - have signed deals worth up to $175,000.\n\nEach team will only play five group games in the inaugural season, though MLC is likely to expand in future years.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",

    "body": "GRAND PRAIRIE — Major League Cricket made its debut Thursday in North Texas.\n\nOn a day when temperatures reached 104 degrees before Thursday’s match, fans braved the Texas heat to witness history. A sea of yellow filled Grand Prairie Stadium, whistling and cheering for the Dallas area’s newest sports team, the Texas Super Kings.\n\nFans supporting the local team didn’t leave disappointed, either. The Super Kings put on a dominant display, defeating the Los Angeles Knight Riders 181-112.\n\nHip-hop music blared through the stadium speakers, and cheers grew louder as a countdown appeared on the scoreboard, counting down to the first ball of the inaugural MLC season.\n\n“This is cricket’s American dream,” was said on the opening of the TV broadcast.\n\nSince the start of the Indian Premier League in 2008, professional cricket has become a lucrative business across the world. However, that success abroad never translated in the U.S.\n\nLeagues such as the American Premier League and Pro Cricket started in the U.S., but could never come near the success of the sport abroad.\n\nMLC hopes to change that, and Thursday night was the first step. The match was sold out, as over 6,000 tickets were claimed, creating a celebratory atmosphere for opening night.\n\n“It felt like we were definitely the home team,” Super Kings captain Faf Du Plessis said.\n\nRelated:‘Cricket City, USA:’ Grand Prairie is home to a new sports league with deep ties for many\n\nEach fan received a Super Kings flag when they entered the stadium, creating a sea of yellow in the stands. Smoke, fireworks and drums rang out with every big hit, generating consistent excitement throughout the night.\n\nEven for the most casual fan, the match delivered exciting moments from the first ball. The Super Kings piled on 181 runs in the first innings, as Lahiru Milantha hit the first six. Ten more followed as the ball flew out of the park in the Texas humidity. After an innings of runs and sixes, the excitement shifted to an innings of wickets when the Knight Riders were up to bat. They were unable to chase the Super Kings’ score, and after 10 of the 11 Knight Riders players were out, the match was over.\n\nChants of “T-S-K” rang out as the fans exited the stadium.\n\nIt was the perfect platform to introduce a sport that has garnered hundreds of millions of views across the world to an American audience that felt long overdue for a product at the highest level. International stars such as Du Plessis and Devin Conway featured for the Super Kings, giving many hardcore D-FW cricket fans a chance to see their favorite players for the first time.\n\nThe crowd was a mix of die-hard cricket fans and Dallas-area sports fans looking for a new type of entertainment. Among the Super Kings jerseys, India jerseys and various jerseys representing teams in the Indian Premier League, were a number of fans wearing Rangers, Cowboys and other Texas-themed sports attire.\n\nWhile much of MLC’s promotion targeted the hardcore fans, the mix that was present on opening night symbolized the opportunity on which the league is looking to capitalize.\n\nRelated:Major League Cricket in Dallas: Season dates, teams, rules and more\n\n“Just very excited to see what is gonna pan out over the next couple years,” Du Plessis said. “I think its got a great future.”\n\nThe opening night atmosphere laid the foundation, and the hype is expected to continue. Matches on Saturday and Monday are already sold out, according to a league spokesperson, signaling a successful start to the league’s inaugural season.\n\nMatches will continue throughout July and will stay in Grand Prairie for the rest of the opening weekend. The action will then move to Church Street Park in Morrisville, N.C., returning to Grand Prairie for playoffs starting July 27.",

    "date": "Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "After years of intrigue and anticipation, and of course speedbumps that has been the norm for a long troubled sport in a goldmine of a location, Major League Cricket was spectacularly unveiled in Houston on Sunday.\n\nWith a pool of overseas stars limited - due to international commitments and India's contracted players unable to play beyond their homegrown Indian Premier League - the MLC did well to recruit several well-known players still at their peak.\n\nSalary caps were reportedly around $1 million per team with top players set to receive similar remuneration per game to cashed-up start-up leagues in the UAE UAE and South Africa.\n\nAlso drafted were a host of expat players, who are flying the flag for a pro cricket league hoped to finally fuel the rise of cricket in the world's biggest market. While born and bred players were perhaps predictably outnumbered, MLC is hoped to spark interest in the younger generations amid such fierce competition for eyeballs.\n\nPrevious attempts at launching a pro league proved unsuccessful, but through such dedication to legitimizing the U.S. - with the sport's governing body identifying it as the No.1 target growth destination - there has been serious investment into MLC.\n\nMLC has secured more than $40 million in funding and over $100 million in “handshakes” with private investors including tech giants Microsoft MSFT .\n\nAround the gaudy inaugural draft, the six franchises were unveiled ahead of the 18-day tournament starting in July. Three of them are owned by franchises from the IPL, cricket's biggest and most lucrative tournament.\n\nThus their names are strikingly familar: Texas Super Kings (Chennai Super Kings), Los Angeles Knight Riders (Kolkata Knight Riders) and MI New York (Mumbai Indians).\n\nIt is obviously quite a deep imprint from the IPL, whose franchises are keen to expand beyond India and become global brands. Several of the them have already planted a stake in other T20 tournaments, but MLC has to be wary it doesn't become labelled as merely an IPL 'satellite' like some of those competitions.\n\nThere is obvious cache for MLC to be business partners with these franchises but it has led to cynicism from some quarters over the tournament's motivations and whether it will actually spur development of cricket at the grassroots level, where the sport's long-term success in the U.S. lies.\n\nFor the IPL, which is starting its 16th edition soon and essentially forces a shut down of international cricket in April and May, it is a chance to further strengthen its multi-billion dollar empire through tentacles into the highly coveted American sports landscape.\n\nIndustry sources say that the IPL's ultimate goal is to become something like the NBA and essentially have seasons that run for more than half a year. To do that it would need international players to start committing essentially full-time to their franchises.\n\nAs IPL franchises expand into different leagues, there is the chance for contracted players to play year-round including in the fledgling MLC.\n\nIf the IPL's ever burgeoning media rights deal keeps exploding, like the NBA, then there will be more cash to throw at cricket's stars who might just be tempted to forgo allegiances to their country.\n\nThat's still all very much down the track, but the eagerness of those IPL franchises to be involved in MLC underlines long-held sentiment over cricket in America.\n\nThere is a lot of money to be made.",
    "summary": "**Key Points:**\n\n* The Major League Cricket (MLC) tournament was officially unveiled in Houston on Sunday, after years of anticipation.\n* Despite limited availability of overseas stars due to international commitments, MLC has recruited well-known players at their peak, with top players set to receive remuneration similar to other start-up leagues.\n* The tournament has secured over $40 million in funding and $100 million in \"handshakes\" with private investors, including tech giant Microsoft.\n* Six franchises were unveiled, with three owned by Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises: Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, and MI New York.\n* The 18-day tournament is set to start in July, with the goal of sparking interest in cricket among younger generations in the US.\n* The MLC has received significant investment, but faces criticism that it may not prioritize development of cricket at the grassroots level in the US.\n\n**Notable Facts:**\n\n* Salary caps for teams are reportedly around $1 million.\n* The IPL's ultimate goal is to become a multi-billion dollar empire with seasons running over half a year.\n* IPL franchises are expanding into different leagues, including MLC, to strengthen their global brand and potentially attract international players to commit to their franchises full-time.",

    "body": "The most ambitious attempt yet to establish professional cricket in the United States gets under way on Wednesday when wickets will be pitched for the start of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket.\n\nWith backing from four franchises in the Indian Premier League, including the league’s most successful teams the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings, MLC has plenty of money and expertise behind it, unlike prior attempts to crack the American market.\n\nAs well as financial muscle and television deals, MLC has also been sanctioned by USA Cricket and the International Cricket Council -- rubber stamps that have been absent from short-lived private ventures in the past.\n\nLike the IPL, the league will play the shortest and most explosive version of cricket, Twenty20, and has recruited some experienced international players.\n\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\n\nWhile cricket has long been played at a recreational level in the USA -- the first-ever international game being between the USA and Canada at New York in 1844 -- there remains a shortage of facilities for the sport in a country where baseball is beloved.\n\nA former baseball park in North Texas, Grand Prairie Stadium, has been transformed into a cricket-specific venue and will be the site of the opener when the Texas Super Kings face the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\n\nWhile organizers expect good levels of support from fans with family backgrounds in cricket-loving countries, they aim to gradually win over the broader American public.\n\n“The goal is to grow the game of cricket and expose the sport in the USA,” tournament director Justin Geale, told AFP.\n\n“We’ve got some of the best players in the world that can actually represent the product, do it justice. So it’s going to be a good quality game of cricket that gives us the best chance to show existing fans and new fans the game.\n\n“We’ve got as far as anyone ever has. So after all the false starts, I think it’s finally here.”\n\nPart of the groundwork that MLC did was been the creation of Minor League Cricket, a 26-team competition which began in 2021 to spark domestic player development.\n\nThe teams will feature a maximum of six foreign players and a minimum of five domestic players and Geale says developing a talent pool for the USA national team is a big part of the mission.\n\n“Building talent here domestically is one of our big pillars for sustainability,” he said.\n\nIt will be a challenge for coaches and captains to manage teams with experienced international players alongside emerging domestic players but South African Robin Peterson, head coach of the Mumbai Indians-backed MI New York team, says it will work.\n\n“In my experience, I found that the local boys tend to learn quite a bit playing alongside these superstars,” he told AFP.\n\n“I’ve seen it firsthand in the SA20 and even if you look at the growth and trajectory of the Indian cricket since the inception of the IPL, it has just been amazing the amount of talent that they’re producing.\n\n“I see the league here playing a similar role for USA cricket.”\n\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia’s Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.\n\nPeterson is optimistic that T20, much more than longer forms of the game, has the ingredients to win eyeballs in the American market.\n\n“It’s becoming more entertainment,” he said. “It speaks to the American sporting psyche where the players are a lot more physical, fitter, stronger, hit the ball further.\n\n“It’s an exciting project. I think it’s about time people start taking cricket seriously in America.”",

    "title": "The Owner of DC’s New Major League Cricket Team Is an Evangelist for the Sport",
    "date": "Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "DC’s newest professional sports team, the Washington Freedom, will make its Major League Cricket debut on Friday with a match against Seattle in Texas.\n\nThe first pro cricket league in the US, MLC has four other teams—Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco—and will play its 2023 season matches at Dallas’ home stadium and at a cricket ground in North Carolina. By 2025, however, the Freedom hope to play home matches in the area at a dual-use baseball/cricket stadium built in partnership with George Mason University.\n\nCricket is estimated to be the second-most popular sport in the world behind soccer, but its appeal is concentrated in South Asia, the Caribbean, South Africa, and Oceania. In the US, the Freedom and MLC initially will be counting on fan interest from South Asian and West Indian immigrant communities that already have flourishing amateur leagues—but future growth will come from building a broader base of support.\n\nTo better understand how the Freedom came to be—and where American cricket is heading—Washingtonian spoke with team owner Sanjay Govil, an IT executive from Rockville and lifelong cricket enthusiast:\n\nTell us a bit about your background. Did you grow up playing cricket?\n\nI was born in Canada, where my father was doing his doctorate, and then we moved back to India.. I grew up playing cricket, like any other Indian. If the total population of India is 1.4 billion, I would say 1.4 billion people either play or follow cricket. So it’s like a religion there, it’s in everybody’s blood, and it’s a national pastime.\n\nI moved to Alabama in my senior year of high school and went to Auburn University. I used to play in Auburn, but obviously there was no mechanism at that time to watch matches. So there was a void for a few years when there was no cricket for me. Then I moved to upstate New York to work for IBM. I did my master’s at Syracuse again and played for the Syracuse cricket team. At that time there was no real league, so we had created our own league in upstate New York. Our captain was Raj Subramaniam, who is now the CEO of FedEx— I just met him again at the Biden state dinner with Prime Minister Modi. I moved to Maryland in ‘91 and have called that my home since then.\n\nIs there a big amateur cricket community in this area?\n\nWe have so many leagues in every county: Loudoun County, Fairfax County, Montgomery County, Howard County, PG County, and Baltimore County. We have fields all over. We have our Infinite Eagles team, which plays the Maryland Cricket Premier League, and we are the most successful in terms of winning championships. So I’m very proud of that. I’m a U.S. citizen, proud to be an American, but at the same time, my love for cricket has always been there.\n\nPeople like us, as we’ve grown, our children have grown, and the amount of kids who are playing cricket now at different academies across the United States is mind boggling. We have parents who literally take their kids at 7 AM and come back at 4 PM for cricket. There’s so much money in cricket now, just like soccer, just like the NFL and so on, that they see this as an avenue where people can play in leagues across the world from the Indian Premier League to Major League Cricket in America, and the Big Bash in Australia. So that’s going to be huge.\n\nSo cricket is one of the most popular sports worldwide, and many Americans, especially South Asians, are die-hard fans. But there are also a lot of Americans who don’t know how it’s played. Are you thinking about ways to build a stronger fanbase in DC?\n\nMy goal is to make this an American sport. The goal here is not just South Asians, they’re already in it, right? So a lot of my effort is going to being an evangelist for this sport among people who are not exposed to cricket. The good news is that they are already being exposed to cricket because, you know, ESPN occasionally has scores. The second thing that’s a very interesting fact is that cricket used to be played in the US until the 1800s.\n\nBut the goal is definitely to evangelize the sport in the US. We’ll start to create a lot of social media stuff on how cricket is played, just to bring awareness. We fully understand this is going to be a multi-year cycle. The beauty about this is that this is a three-hour game and you go there and just bang, bang, bang. It is run after run after run, and you go there and have beer, burgers and hot dogs and you know, all the stuff we love here. So it’s a combination of being at a party and enjoying a game.\n\nMajor League Baseball has been trying to pick up the pace of its games. Is cricket a faster paced game?\n\nI think it’s as fast-paced as the NFL and the NBA, and there is no comparison between baseball and cricket in terms of pace. I mean, it’s nonstop action. The only time there’s no action is when the bowler is coming in to bowl, but there’s action even then, because there’s so much anticipation. And every ball counts. So it’s a very intense game, very fast paced, and you really get into it when you’re supporting your team.\n\nThis first season lasts less than a month, and all the games take place in Texas and North Carolina, where stadiums already exist. When will DC get its own cricket stadium?\n\nThe goal is to have your stadiums up and running as soon as possible. Our goal is 2025, and as every city has its own stadium, we’re obviously going to have matches in each stadium. So the limiting factor is the lack of infrastructure right now. We’re very fortunate that we teamed up with George Mason University to build a stadium, which is going to be a combo of baseball and a cricket field, the first in the United States of America, and it’s going to be a great blueprint for all universities and colleges. And next to us—I cannot name the team—but there’s going to be another professional team coming next to us. They’re building their stadium there, and the concept is to build a whole township in that area. This is being built in the West campus [in Fairfax] because they have like 130 acres of land. So it’s going to be a great thing for the community and a great thing for Washington. The [T20] World Cup is slated to be hosted by a combination of the United States and West Indies next year. It’s already announced. That’s another big impetus for cricket. And then the Olympics 2028 is looking at adding cricket. If that happens, then it’s going to be a full court press on improving cricket in America.",

We can’t wait to get out on the field at Grand Prairie Stadium and represent the Lone Star State in front of a full house and be part of a special night for cricket in America!” Du Plessis said.\n\nFellow Proteas David Miller and Gerald Coetzee will join Du Plessis at TSK, while legendary West Indian T20 all-rounder Dwayne Bravo is also part of the squad. There is a further South African flavour added to the TSK pot with former Dolphins duo Calvan Savage and Cody Chetty along with former Proteas and Warriors seam bowler Rusty Theron registered as local American players after relocating to the US a few years ago.\n\nTheron, 37, played 36 white-ball internationals for the Proteas, while also having IPL experience with the Deccan Chargers, Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab.\n\nThe LA Knight Riders, meanwhile, will feature Proteas top-order batter Rilee Rossouw along with West Indian superstar Andre Russell. Former Free State duo Shadley van Schalkwyk and Corne Dry also form part of the Knight Riders squad as “localised” Americans.\n\nThe four remaining teams MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom will also have a large South African presence.\n\nProteas superstar Kagiso Rabada along with wunderkid Dewald Brevis will join up at MI New York again, while the Seattle Orcas will be led by Proteas all-rounder Wayne Parnell.\n\nParnell will be hoping his Proteas teammate Quinton de Kock strikes some form at the top of the order to fire up the Orcas’ batting unit. Gauteng teenager Matthew Tromp is also part of the Orcas’ squad.\n\nLungi Ngidi will be looking forward to some much-needed gametime with the San Francisco Unicorns after performing drinks duties throughout the IPL. He’s joined by “locals” left-arm seamer Carmi le Roux, who played for the Nelson Mandela Super Giants in the Mzansi Super League, and former Warriors batter David White.\n\nProteas top guns Anrich Nortje and Marco will form a fearsome new-ball duo at Washington Freedom where they will link up with former Proteas and Western Province off-spinner Dane Piedt and SA U19 all-rounder Justin Dill. Piedt’s last of his nine Test matches was against India in Ranchi in 2019.",

    "title": "Major League Cricket set to take USA by storm amid fears of impact on English game",
    "date": "Sat Apr  1 08:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Last month, the draft for the inaugural Major League Cricket campaign took place at Houston's iconic space centre.\n\nIt feels surreal writing those words, to be honest, but there wasn’t a more fitting venue to launch this ambitious, exciting enterprise. Two decades after T20 cricket burst onto the scene, Major League Cricket will become the first professional franchise tournament to be established across the pond.\n\nThe United States isn’t a country renowned for its love of cricket, but the new competition will have a profound impact on the sport's long and ever-changing anatomy if it's successful.\n\nThat is a big if. As Robbie Williams and other British musicians will tell you, cracking the American market is no easy feat. Yet the architects of Major League Cricket - including former England bowler and World Cup winner Liam Plunkett - are confident of success.\n\n\"I’m very excited… I think it's got massive potential,\" Plunkett tells Mirror Sport. \"I think we need to do it our way. We keep the [T20] cricket structure the same… but then we build up around that as the Americans would. You put the glitter on it; you have all the fireworks.\"\n\nBuilding Major League Cricket\n\nCricket is not a new phenomenon in the United States. The sport was brought across the pond by the British and remained popular after the country gained independence in the late 18th century.\n\nWhat's your opinion on Major League Cricket? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nIn fact, cricket's first ever international match was contested between the United States and Canada in 1844. It is believed up to 20,000 people attended St George's Cricket Club in New York to watch the first day's play, with Canada winning the two-innings match by 23 runs.\n\nEventually, though, baseball became America's sport with a stick, and cricket's popularity waned. There have been attempts to establish a professional game in the United States before, but to no avail. Yet confidence has been renewed for a variety of reasons.\n\nMajor League Cricket's architects have developed the infrastructure for a franchise tournament to flourish, while the South Asian American population has grown to five million.\n\nJustin Geale, Major League Cricket’s tournament director, explains, \"Cricket is played here, across the country, in great numbers. There are many leagues; it's been tried a couple of times to do it to this scale.\n\n\"Infrastructure is the biggest challenge we have... that's been a stumbling block in holding back the game from growing. That's been a big focus of ours during the last three years - to build an infrastructure so we can get more of elite, high-performance cricket happening.\"\n\nPlunkett adds, \"That’s why we’re here - for cricket. A lot of hard work has been going on behind the scenes. A lot of stuff is out on socials and people can see that hard work.\"\n\nMinor League Cricket, a development tournament first played in 2021, has helped build momentum and will continue to act as a feeder league for Major League Cricket.\n\n\"We've spent three years building out of Minor League Cricket, so we've now got that pathway,\" notes Geale. \"I guess it's the unsexy stuff that no one's seen or heard about during the last few years; what we've had to do to get to these announcements for Major League Cricket, which is a lot more exciting and a bit more glitz and glamour.\"\n\nIPL influence\n\nThe road to Major League Cricket started in 2019, when USA Cricket - the sport's new governing body - brought on American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) as investors.\n\nAn initial $120million of funding was secured, with Indian Premier League (IPL) chiefs investing in four of the franchises: Los Angeles Knight Riders (parent club, Kolkata Knight Riders), MI New York (Mumbai Indians), Texas Super Kings (Chennai Super Kings) and Seattle Orcas (Delhi Capitals). The other Major League Cricket teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom.\n\nThat experience and wealth is crucial to the project's success. On a per-game basis, the IPL is the world’s second most valuable sporting competition after the NFL, which means its broadcasting rights are more lucrative than English football’s Premier League.\n\n\"Why now?\" Geale asks. \"I think ACE, which is our parent company in Major League Cricket, has the right mix of high-network investors who are very smart businesspeople - savvy businesspeople - in their own right. We pair them with some IPL teams... to get that mix of business and sport.\n\n\"America doesn't know it needs cricket, but if you look at something like baseball - and I love baseball - but it can be pretty slow. So, we're looking at T20 - about the same duration [as baseball]; high scoring; lots of sixes... While we have an existing cricket market here of fans… if we can drag some new people to the sport, there's such a big opportunity.\n\n\"It's the second largest sport in the world - it's the largest sports media market in the world - and if we can make it work, I think it's going to be now. If not now, when?\"\n\nAttracting the stars\n\nAnother boost for Major League Cricket is the presence of Plunkett and former New Zealand international Corey Anderson, who have become ambassadors for the new competition. Plunkett is also Major League Cricket’s national development coach.\n\n\"Liam is crucial to us,\" explains Geale. \"You look at someone like Liam, who's done it all for his country at the highest level. Someone like Corey Anderson, who is really experienced. They've both married American wives, so they've set up their lives here.\n\n\"It's so important to have cricket people around. When I got here, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of cricket - but I was really shocked by the [lack of] infrastructure.\n\n\"What we really lacked, though, was that cricket experience and knowledge, so having someone like Liam... he's still a great player and I can tell you he's absolutely steaming in at the moment! He's pumped to play Major League Cricket.\n\n\"But the experience in terms of coaching - not just our high-performance guys, but just new people to the sport. He's an ambassador, as well. The more guys we drag like that, who are probably towards the end of their playing career, I think he [Plunkett] wouldn't mind me saying that... they've got so much to add from a coaching aspect.\"\n\nMajor League Cricket has also attracted some huge international stars, with the likes of Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Marsh, Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje all signing up during the inaugural draft.\n\nMore superstars are expected to join before the tournament gets underway, although Geale has dismissed rumours of England batter Jason Roy being handed a £300,000 contract. He laughs, \"A little bit inflated... a bit of fake news there, as we say in the USA!\"\n\nBut the tournament chief admits, \"We really will be able to get a lot of the top players - there's a real curiosity about coming to play here. I think our salary cap is going to be pretty competitive, compared to some of the other leagues at the moment.\n\n\"The idea to come and play cricket in a new market, like the US. To spend two or three weeks here and bring the golf clubs and bring your family and actually play some good level cricket. But also, it's a different experience for players.\n\n\"To date, we haven't had any trouble attracting some of these top guys.\"\n\nPlunkett adds, \"I still want to test myself against the best players in the world but also help promote the league. We want the best stars - the best players in the world - to come across and see that Major League Cricket is taking this seriously.\n\n\"We want it to be here for a long time. We're not just a gimmick - we want it to be a successful franchise league with great competition. Of course, I want the best players to come from all over the world.\"\n\nEnglish worries\n\nAlthough Major League Cricket is an exciting venture, there are concerns in England. The inaugural tournament takes place between July 13 and July 30 - just before the peak of the English season in August.\n\nIt's squeezed in between the Vitality Blast and The Hundred - England's premier T20 tournaments - and will attract the attention of English white-ball specialists who are not restricted by an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) contract. Major League Cricket will clash with the Ashes, which has been brought forward to June and July to make way for The Hundred.\n\nCrucially, though, three County Championship games will take place during July. A lot of county players will be tempted to miss those fixtures and head to Dallas, with Major League Cricket offering \"competitive\" salaries. It's fair to say the counties are not doing the same.\n\nThere is a real concern that Major League Cricket will persuade more young players to pursue white-ball only careers. Will Smeed, one of England's most talented young batters, said goodbye to red-ball cricket aged 21 last year.\n\nPacking in the long slog of four-day cricket for a pulsating whack in front of a capacity crowd looks increasingly more appealing. As former England captain Michael Atherton wrote in his column for The Times, \"English cricket will be watching nervously.\"\n\nGeale and Plunkett, though, do not see Major League Cricket as a rival to the English game.\n\nGeale insists, \"We’re certainly not here to disrupt or take on world cricket - I'm not going to say that. It's the opposite summer to a lot of the down under countries, so I think we've got a nice little slot. I think they can coexist, there's enough players of good quality going around in the world at the moment.\"\n\nPlunkett adds, \"It's a unique situation because I don't want to dilute English cricket, but I also want to build-up Major League Cricket. So, that [question] is for the powers that be, I'm afraid!\"\n\nYet Major League Cricket is hoping to attract some of England's international stars, many of whom won the 2019 World Cup alongside Plunkett. The bowler admits, \"I'd love it to work out with England because obviously I've got a lot of friends there, and the England team is the best white-ball team in the world.\"\n\nGeale explains, \"Realistically, it's unlikely we're going to get red-ball, centrally-contracted ECB players - and that's fine. Their priority needs to be playing for their country.\n\n\"Having said that, I think our window... will probably be attractive to some of the white-ball guys. We have had a few of the white-ball guys reach out, and it'll be lovely to have a couple of guys from England because I think we are covered from Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa, West Indies... we're going to have players from everywhere.\n\n\"It'll be nice to have some English guys, obviously, but there's a process and the guys need to look at their country of origin first of all and make sure they're happy there [with their schedules]. Ideally, we'd love to have the guys come out - I think there's a world where they can do both, to be honest.\"\n\nWorld Cup and beyond\n\nGeale is hoping Major League Cricket can play an important role in the upcoming T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the United States. The event will take place next June, but the International Cricket Council (ICC) are yet to confirm which venues will be used.\n\nMost of the fixtures for the inaugural Major League Cricket campaign will take place at the Grand Prairie Stadium, a former ballpark which is being converted into a cricket ground. The revamped arena will hold 7,000 spectators and is expandable to 15,000. It would be a huge boost for Major League Cricket's spiritual home to play a part in next year's World Cup.\n\nGeale says, \"We'd love our stadium in Dallas to host some matches, and I'm pretty confident it will. We're working really closely with the ICC on that. I think that [competition] and another Major League Cricket season - there's a lot of talk of cricket in the 2028 LA Olympics. You look at those milestones, and that's the progression for the sport [and it's] a really strong one.\n\n\"We're incredibly excited about the World Cup. I think it also gives us exposure to a lot of other nations - teams will need somewhere to prepare, they'll come out. They'll be opportunities for the USA national team to play warm-up matches; to show our venues.\n\n\"Where I'm in Morrisville now, there's no reason why this wouldn't be a great place for a team to come and spend a couple of weeks and prepare. There's going to be great practice wickets; there's great hotels around. All that sort of stuff really adds to our infrastructure and ability to host international touring teams, which ultimately we'd love to do more of.\n\n\"There's no reason once we have the stadiums and people are really embracing the sport, that more tournaments can't be held in the US.\"\n\nRight now, the future is bright for Major League Cricket. Not everyone will be a fan of it, particularly traditionalists in England, but the new competition’s architects are sitting on a fortune.\n\nAll the ingredients are there for franchise cricket to explode in the United States, yet they still have to get this right. They do not want Major League Cricket to be another failed attempt to crack the American market.\n\nUltimately, only time will tell whether Major League Cricket has lift off… or a problem.",

    "body": "8.5 to MJ Santner , Wickets continue to tumble! Dug into the pitch and it kicks off the deck, lures him to go for the big shot and he goes for the pull, top edge fountained up as keeper settles underneath and hangs onto it brilliantly. His ebullience only lasts for five deliveries. Swung big but didn't control his bat and de Kock had plenty of time to track the ball which safely nestles in his glove. Third umpire checked if it was a no ball, well his foot landed before sliding past the popping crease so it's a legitimate delivery. 48 / 6\n\n5.2 to C Chetty , Another one bites the dust! TSK innings in absolute disarray; third wicket down! Round the wicket, hits the deck hard and gets the ball to bounce steeply off the deck, it was a cutter. He was not in a good position to play the paddle and ends up giving a easy catch to Imad Wasim at short fine who reverse cups it, a nifty catch. 40 / 3\n\n7.1 to DA Miller , Gottim with a beauty! Parnell is on fire! Beautiful seam position, pitches on a length and jags back just enough to beat his drive; pings the top of off and the bails are flying everywhere. Incision! This is turning out to be a great bowling spell, captain leading from the front. 45 / 4\n\n7.4 to Milind Kumar , Are you kidding me? Nauman Anwar plucks a stunning catch out of thin air at square leg but wait, the umpires want to take another look at it. This was pitched short and angled into the body, he went for the full-blooded pull but didn't get the elevation and wasn't really under-controlled. The catch looks okay to me on the replay and Aleem Dar agrees; OUT on the big screen and he has to go back into the hut! He was charging in from deep and dived forward to gobble it up. Kept his eyes on the ball and judged the catch impeccably. 46 / 5\n\n19.3 to DJ Bravo , That went miles up in the air and then into Harmeet's bucket hands. Back of the hand slower one and Bravo tries to muscle a pull but mistimes it.. 126 / 8\n\n19.4 to Zia-ul-Haq , Opens the face of the blade ever so slightly and tries to loft it over long-off, ball swirling in the air and Klaasen was circling around trying to keep track of the ball; takes a superb diving catch. 126 / 9",

    "body": "Watch: Casual running between the wickets cost Finn Allen his wicket in an MLC 2023 match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.\n\nDespite some tight bowling from Carmi le Roux (4-0-29-0) and Marcus Stoinis (4-0-28-0), the Seattle Orcas posted 177-4 in the fourth match of the 2023 MLC after Wayne Parnell won the toss and opted to bat. The big innings came from Heinrich Klaasen (53 in 31 balls).\n\nIn response, Finn Allen blocked the first ball he faced and edged the second, from Imad Wasim, before exploding in characteristic fashion.\n\nHe hit Imad for six. When Parnell replaced Imad for the third over, Allen went four, dot, six, four, four, four, racing to 28 off nine balls.\n\nMatthew Wade then flicked the first ball of the next over, from Cameron Gannon, for a run. At this point, San Francisco were 42-0 in 3.1 overs: they needed 136 in 101 balls with all their wickets in hand.\n\nBack on strike, Allen turned the ball towards mid-wicket and jogged for a single. Former Sri Lanka international Shehan Jayasuriya, playing as a local player in the US-based competition, threw the ball at the non-striker’s end.\n\nDespite the casual jog, Allen had his ground covered. He now tried to plunge his bat into the crease. He had timed it correctly, but his calculations were foiled by his bat, which got stuck in the turf.\n\nAs the bat fell from Allen’s hand, the ball hit the stumps, and the umpire ruled Allen run out.\n\nWade followed not too long afterwards, but Stoinis and captain Aaron Finch took San Francisco to 86-2. Then they perished in the space of three balls, and Seattle bowled out San Francisco for 142 as Gannon claimed 4-23. The only resistance came from Shadab Khan (37 in 23 balls).\n\nWatch Finn Allen get run out at the MLC:",

Swung big but doesn't get enough power and elevation behind the shot.. 154 / 5\n\n18.3 to SP Narine , Looks to go over mid-off but doesn't connect well! Length ball on a tight off stump line, Pienaar moves across and almost shelled it as the ball popped out of his hands but he recovered well to hang onto it in the second attempt. Narine goes without troubling the scorers. 154 / 6\n\n3.2 to JJ Roy , Huge appeal for lbw and up goes the finger! Round the wicket, lands it on a length and it zings back to rap on his pads. A stunning delivery and right on money, does him for pace as well and traps him straight in front. That was just too good and he gets reward for some wonderful bowling. 11 / 1\n\n6.2 to NR Kumar , Fuller and outside off, he is playing away from his body, extends his hands out and carves it away to deep extra cover where Pienaar takes a comfortable catch down his throat. Just couldn't get underneath it on this occasion and there wasn't much power behind the shot. It was a slower delivery and he did well to keep it away from his range. 37 / 2\n\n6.5 to UBT Chand , Big shout for an lbw and the umpire raises the dreaded finger, good length and raps him on the pad as he tries to flick it away to the leg side, that looks plumb and he doesn't decide to take a second opinion. What an over it is turning out to be for Henriques!. 38 / 3\n\n19.1 to CA Dry , Holes out to long-on! High full-toss outside off, tries to clear the rope, didn't get all of it. Short tracks the ball from the bat, through the air, towards him and then into his hand. 166 / 7",

The match will take place in front of a sold-out crowd, according to MLC officials, who announced on Monday that opening-day tickets are gone. Then, this weekend the final four teams in the women's Volleyball Nations League (VNL) will take to the courts for matches and a medal ceremony at College Park Center in Arlington.\n\nMLC has been in the works for over a year, starting with renovation crews who turned the old Texas Airhogs baseball stadium in Grand Prairie into a professional cricket oval. The cricket stadium will become the launching ground for the new professional cricket league, along with a second stadium in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\n\"We are thankful to the fans for their support and to the city of Grand Prairie for believing in this vision,\" says MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta by email. \"Tickets are selling fast for the rest of the matches in North Texas and North Carolina, with sellouts expected for further games. We know our teams will put on an amazing show of explosive T20 cricket for the fans.\"\n\nIf you missed your chance to get tickets for MLC's opening day, the Grand Prairie stadium will host 11 more matches in July, including matches against teams like the San Francisco Unicorns, the Washington Freedom and the Seattle Orcas. The Grand Prairie stadium will also host the league's first championship match on July 30.\n\n\"Since we arrived in Texas, it's been incredible to see the support for the Texas Super Kings,\" says Texas team captain and former South African national cricket team captain Faf du Plessis. \"We can't wait to get out on the field at Grand Prairie Stadium and represent the Lone Star State in front of a full house.\"\n\nThis weekend, Arlington will host VNL's finals. The four teams that compete in Arlington for the championship medals will be determined by two days of quarterfinal matches: Poland vs. Germany and U.S. vs. Japan on Wednesday, and Brazil vs. China and Turkey vs. Italy on Thursday.\n\nTeam U.S.A.'s roster includes several top players from our neck of the woods, like Asjia O'Neal, who grew up in Southlake and played volleyball for the University of Texas. There, she was named All-American and helped achieve the school's fourth national championship in 2022. O'Neal finished UT's finals in 2022 with nine kills and a 0.43 hitting percentage, according to Texassports.com.\n\nMiddle player Chiaka Ogbogu from Coppell is also on the U.S. roster. She competed for the University of Texas, where she broke the school's record for career blocks in 2017 with 534. She also competed on the Olympic women's volleyball team and took home a gold medal at the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games, according to USAVolleyball.org.\n\nAs of Monday, the U.S. is one point away from first with 28 points, just behind Poland's 29 points. The U.S. has already won three VNL titles but the players will have their work cut out for them since Poland has had a stellar 10–2 season and are looking to score their first championship win this weekend.",

    "date": "Thu Jul 13 18:56:11 2023",
    "body": "A mix of Pakistan cricket’s cream and some familiar expats will be in action in the United States when the inaugural season of the Major League Cricket (MLC) — a long-awaited T20 tournament — kicks off on Friday (July 14).\n\nFast bowler Haris Rauf and all-rounders Shadab Khan and Imad Wasim are some of the big names from Pakistan who will participate in the first-of-its kind event being jointly hosted in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nHaris and Shadab, the two centrally contracted players, will represent San Francisco Unicorns, while Imad will be playing for Seattle Orcas.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, Texas Super Kings, and Washington Freedom are the four other teams participating in the league. The 19-day competition will go on from July 13 to July 30 at Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park.\n\nThe announcements came in earlier this month as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) granted no-objection certificates (NOCs) to the players after getting approval from the team management, medical panel, and the selection committee.\n\nThere were reports suggesting that the PCB demanded $25,000 per player to grant the NOCs.\n\nSeveral international players, who left Pakistan for greener pastures of the US, will also be seen in action, including Hammad Azam, Sami Aslam, Ehsan Adil, Saif Badar, Saad Ali, and Mukhtar Ahmed. They will be participating in MLC as local players.\n\nAzam and Adil will be representing the New York franchise owned by the Mumbai Indians of the Indian Premier League. While they left the country almost two-and-a-half years ago, the duo officially announced their retirement from Pakistan cricket only last week, as per a press release from PCB on Sunday.\n\n“If you’re a former professional in another country, like Pakistan or West Indies, you have to show an NOC and an intent of retirement and then you’re considered a local for domestic leagues here,” Zubin Sarkari, tournament director of Minor League Cricket, said.\n\nSarkari, who is also currently handling operations at MLC, said that any player who can provide proof of intention to live in the US by having spent ten out of 12 months of the year in the country, and carries an approved visa is considered a local player by the domestic leagues’ management.\n\nLack of opportunities, excessive competition at home and, in a few cases, disregard from the PCB had led some of these cricketers to move to the USA.\n\nAslam, who has represented Pakistan in 13 Test matches and four One-Day Internationals, was dropped from the national squad in 2017. After struggling to find his way back in the team despite performing well domestically, the left-hander decided to move to the US in 2020 to seek a fresh start to his professional career.\n\n“Every player who is not playing in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is willing to come here,” Aslam told Dawn.com.\n\n“I know people who are currently leading teams in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy [and they are] saying that if they get an offer to play in the US, they will come here without thinking twice.”\n\nThe 27-year-old rued that countries such as Australia, England and India reward players who play red-ball cricket, but Pakistan ignores its longer format players. “That’s the reason why Test cricket is going down in the country.” he said.\n\n“Nobody wants to play the longer format and those who do, do it as an obligation. Players know that selectors don’t choose players who perform in the four-month long domestic season but the ones who perform in one season of the PSL.”\n\nCo-founded by Indian businessmen Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan among others, MLC has six teams, of which four are owned by various franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nAslam, who was picked by the Texas Super Kings in the domestic players draft held earlier in March, said he “wasn’t expecting to be picked by an IPL franchise because there were rumors of Indian teams not selecting Pakistani players but that didn’t happen”.\n\nHe added that they (the Super Kings) might have considered him as a US local resident instead.\n\n“I’m having a lot of fun.

    "date": "Tue Sep 26 18:38:44 2023",
    "body": "A New Innings for Cricket in the Land of Opportunities\n\nIf you search for actual viewer numbers, it’s evident that cricket competes with soccer on a global scale. Soccer takes the lead with 3.5 billion viewers, while cricket follows closely with 2.5 billion. Cricket, frequently acknowledged for its substantial worldwide fanbase, has historically faced challenges in gaining traction in the United States. Nevertheless, a new era is emerging in American sports as Major League Cricket (MLC) steps onto the scene, unveiling an ambitious strategy to reshape the sporting landscape.\n\nThis ambitious endeavor aims to bring cricket, with all its grace and fervor, to the forefront of American sporting consciousness.\n\nIt all began in 1844 when the first international cricket game was played between the USA and Canada at the St George’s Cricket Club in New York. Following that, in 1859, a team of leading English professionals embarked on the first-ever overseas tour to North America.\n\nFast forward to 1965, the American Cricket Association was formed, marking the inception of organized cricket efforts in the United States. Since then, numerous endeavors have been made to popularize the sport, ranging from grassroots initiatives to international exhibition matches. However, it wasn’t until the establishment of Major League Cricket that American sports fans truly began to take notice.\n\nA Strategic Blueprint for Success\n\nHow Will MLC Become America’s Next Sports Obsession?\n\nMajor League Cricket’s strategy is to build on the large tradition of cricket with the demands of the modern American audience by presenting the sport as accessible and exciting, rather than an esoteric pastime. MLC understands that cricket’s rules and terminologies might be unfamiliar to many Americans, so they have taken measures to simplify and explain the intricacies of the sport.\n\nIn line with this approach, the inaugural 6 franchise teams consist of established franchises/organizations with significant expertise, resources, and a substantial fan base from their respective origins. Four of these franchises are derived from the highly prosperous Indian Premier League (IPL), while the remaining two represent Australian states, each having ties to the Big Bash League (BBL) franchises. Notably, the IPL, BBL, English T20 league, The Hundred, South African T20 league, and Caribbean T20 leagues have all achieved remarkable success in inspiring the creation of additional domestic leagues, fostering heightened fan engagement, participation, and enthusiasm.\n\nBeyond that, the league recognized the power of sports entertainment in America. As such, they aim to integrate captivating elements such as vibrant team identities, dynamic fan engagement strategies, and state-of-the-art arenas, creating an immersive experience for new MLC fans. By adapting cricket to fit the preferences of American sports enthusiasts while preserving its core essence, Major League Cricket is positioning itself for a shot at fandom success.\n\nOver the past few years, the MLC’s efforts have secured more than $40 million in funding and over $100 million in “handshakes” with private investors including tech giant Microsoft.\n\nFanning the Flames of Fandom\n\nWhat makes any sports team is its cult following and the undying passion of its fans.\n\nBy cultivating fan engagement through interactive experiences and initiatives like meet-and-greet sessions with players, MLC will ignite a new fan base and foster a sense of belonging.\n\nIn support of their on-site activations, MLC will use the power of social media and digital platforms, to reach wider audiences and create a virtual community for cricket fans across the nation.\n\nShaping the American Sports Narrative\n\nThe emergence of Major League Cricket has the potential to deepen the American love of sports and athleticism, joining the ranks of the NFL, NBA, and MLB. As cricket gains traction in the US, it introduces a new layer of diversity to the sporting landscape, offering a fresh perspective to sports fans in America.\n\nThe Minor League is also an integral part of this vision, which lays the foundation for sustainable and inclusive growth of cricket in the American sports scene, envisioning a future where cricket proudly stands among the nation’s top sports. It’s not simply about adding another sport to the weekend lineup, it’s about embracing new culture, fostering communities, and creating shared experiences that transcend the game.\n\nCricket is set to make its triumphant return to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. To prepare for the arrival of this exciting sport on American soil and the Olympics, brush up on Cricket terms HERE.",
    "summary": "**Overview**: Major League Cricket (MLC) is a new cricket league in the United States aiming to popularize the sport in the country.\n\n**Strategy**: MLC's strategy is to make cricket accessible and exciting to the modern American audience by simplifying the rules and terminology, and presenting the sport in a vibrant and engaging way.\n\n**Franchises**: The inaugural 6 franchise teams come from established franchises/organizations with significant expertise, resources, and fan bases from the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Australian Big Bash League (BBL).\n\n**Investment**: MLC has secured over $40 million in funding and over $100 million in \"handshakes\" with private investors, including tech giant Microsoft.\n\n**Fan Engagement**: MLC plans to cultivate fan engagement through interactive experiences, meet-and-greets with players, and social media/digital platforms to create a virtual community for cricket fans across the nation.\n\n**Impact**: The emergence of MLC has the potential to deepen the American love of sports and athleticism, introducing a new layer of diversity to the sporting landscape and offering a fresh perspective to sports fans in America.",

    "body": "Renovation works ongoing at Grand Prairie Stadium, which could be used for 2024 World Cup\n\nAfter several years of delays, the first season of Major League Cricket has been announced for July 13-30, 2023 with a newly renovated venue outside of Dallas, Texas serving as the primary location for the 18-day tournament. The announcement coincided with the installation of the turf square at Grand Prairie Stadium, with further renovation work to finish the transformation of the 7200 permanent-seat facility (which can be expanded to 15,000 with temporary seating for larger events) from a minor league baseball ground formerly known as Airhogs Stadium into a full-time cricket venue expected to be completed by the spring of next year.\n\n\"Next summer, the eyes of world cricket will be on the launch of Major League Cricket, with the stars of the game competing over three weeks of fast-paced T20 action,\" Justin Geale, MLC Tournament Director, said. \"The launch of MLC will transform American cricket and provide one of the best platforms in the sport for the world's most elite players to showcase their skills while also fast-tracking the development of domestic talent to feature in the league.\"\n\nA lease for the Grand Prairie facility was first acquired by MLC in November 2020 with renovation initially anticipated to be completed by early 2022. However, a series of delays pushed back not just the redevelopment of the venue but also the launch of MLC's first season by more than a year.\n\nDemolition and redevelopment at Grand Prairie Stadium finally began in July 2022 and has continued at a brisk pace in order to get it ready by next spring and make it the centerpiece venue of the competition. It means that organisers are now confident that the time is right to kick things off in 2023 and have picked out a window that they believe will avoid any clashes with both the CPL and the Hundred. The opportunity to play at a ground which is in the running to stage matches at the 2024 T20 World Cup, co-hosted by USA and the West Indies, is also expected to lure overseas professionals on the franchise circuit to play in MLC's first season.\n\nEarlier this year, MLC hired Dave Agnew as head curator to oversee the development of the cricket square at Grand Prairie Stadium and also to serve as a consultant on the development of other MLC facilities in the works. The Australian has previously worked as head curator at the CPL and the Global T20 Canada and has also done consultant work at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, which has hosted the first two tournament finals of the Minor League Cricket T20 championship that serves as a feeder competition into MLC.\n\n\"Grand Prairie Stadium will be the best cricket venue in the United States upon its completion,\" said Ron Jensen, Mayor of Grand Prairie. \"This venue will be a huge asset to the Grand Prairie community, bringing Major League Cricket, international cricket and potentially the 2024 ICC T20 Men's World Cup to Grand Prairie allowing fans here to experience a world-class sport in action.\"\n\nThe first season of MLC will be staged in a single round-robin format with 15 league matches played among six franchises before a four-match play-off phase. In addition to Dallas, MLC has previously announced that the franchises will be based in Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington DC, San Francisco and New York City. The Knight Riders Group has already come on board to be the owners of the Los Angeles franchise with a proposal in the works for a 10,000 seat venue in Orange County.\n\nHowever, the Orange County venue still has not been finalised, let alone broken ground, and stadium projects in the other cities have also been slow to materialise. It means that MLC organisers may end up using a single site in Grand Prairie for the entirety of the 2023 season. It is an approach that was similarly used to stage the Global T20 Canada in 2018 and 2019 in which all matches were played in suburban Toronto despite franchises being billed as hailing from cities all across Canada.\n\nUnlike the Global T20 Canada and many other big-ticket cricket events that have been held in the USA in which start times have been scheduled for late morning in blistering heat to accommodate for the Indian prime time TV audience, sources have said that organisers intend to utilise the floodlights at the facility to stage the majority of matches at night. It will allow for more comfortable playing conditions in the summer Texas heat and encourage more fans to support the event on the ground.\n\nSources have also stated that Church Street Park in North Carolina may potentially be used as a venue for some of MLC's matches in 2023. Even though no franchise is designated for North Carolina, the venue has demonstrated consistently strong fan support for local cricket since hosting the 2018 ICC Americas Regional T20 World Cup Qualifier and using it for some games would also alleviate wear and tear on the pitches at Grand Prairie.\n\nPeter Della Penna is ESPNcricinfo's USA correspondent @PeterDellaPenna",

    "body": "MS Dhoni, the Indian cricket legend, watched helplessly as the ball - possibly with flames coming out of it - disappeared into the terraces.\n\nHis trademark deadpan expression undersold the moment. Dhoni might have seen it all before during his long career, but he had rarely been on the receiving end of such a hijacking. Dhoni might even have allowed himself a wry smile as he recalled doing similar deeds in his pomp.\n\nThe ashen-faced capacity crowd in the normally rambunctious Chepauk told the story with eerie silence only punctuated by jubilation in the middle of the ground from Australian Marcus Stoinis, whose unbelievable century stole this gripping Indian Premier League match for Lucknow.\n\nIt was a reminder of the match-winning abilities of the muscular Stoinis, who has performed several miracles during his international career. When he is in the zone, there aren't many cleaner strikers of the cricket ball than Stoinis, whose nuggety built is more reminiscent of popular brutish football codes of his homeland - Australian rules and rugby.\n\nAfter striking one of the IPL's greatest innings, 124 off 63 balls to mow down the massive target of 211, Stoinis surely has cemented his spot in Australia's T20 World Cup squad, which is set to be announced next week.\n\nThere has been some uncertainty over Stoinis' international future. The 34-year-old was overlooked for last November's World Cup final against India with the Australian hierarchy's decision to stick with the more reliable batting presence of Marnus Labuschagne ultimately justified.\n\nIt has seemed like Australia might transition away from allrounder Stoinis, who was a hero in their drought-breaking T20 World Cup triumph in 2o21 with his death hitting proving crucial.\n\nAustralia have pivoted towards Tim David, who has lit up T20 franchise leagues around the world, as their death specialist while new sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk is also in the frame for World Cup selection having starred in the ongoing IPL.\n\nStoinis, however, provides a wealth of experience that those younger players don't yet have. His century came at an interesting juncture of his career after Stoinis missed out on a Cricket Australia contract for 2024-25.\n\nHe was also left off Western Australia's contract list, which wasn't particularly surprising given he didn't play for them at all this season. While not officially a T20 franchise freelancer, Stoinis has felt like one in recent seasons. He has rarely been sighted at the WACA given his traversing the planet, which can at times make it hard to remember where he is at any given moment.\n\nThere was a rather amusing anecdote in a Perth press box during the recent Big Bash League season, with a match from South Africa's T20 league beaming from the television. And in the frame was the unmistakable hulking figure of Stoinis. \"Wasn't he just in the BBL? I had no idea he was playing in South Africa,\" chuckled a reporter.\n\nStoinis will now have even greater flexibility to pursue opportunities on the T20 merry-go-round, including America's Major League Cricket with whom he played for in the tournament's debut season last year.\n\nBut Stoinis still wants to continue his international cricket even beyond the T20 World Cup. That remains to be seen, but Stoinis looms as a vital player in Australia's title hopes as he eyes silencing more stunned fans just like he did on that unforgettable night in Chepauk.",

    "body": "The United States isn't the first place you think of when someone mentions cricket, but Liam Plunkett wants to change that perception this summer.\n\nThe former England fast bowler, 37, will star in Major League Cricket this July, a new T20 tournament which is hoping to attract some of the sport's biggest names. Plunkett, who is also Major League Cricket's national development coach, has not played professional cricket for nearly two years but is relishing the chance to test himself against the best.\n\n\"I still feel, for my age, I'm one of the fittest around,\" Plunkett tells Mirror Sport. \"Obviously the last year or so has been Minor League Cricket, but now it's building up to proper cricket. I've given myself a three-month window to be in tip-top shape for Major League Cricket. I'm taking it seriously - I'm there to compete and win games. I'm not there just to take part.\"\n\nThere is every expectation Plunkett will leave his mark on Major League Cricket this summer. Justin Geale, Major League Cricket's tournament director, notes, \"He's still a great player, and I can tell you he's absolutely steaming in at the moment!\"\n\nMajor League Cricket is America's first professional franchise tournament, with organisers hoping to establish the T20 game across the pond. An initial $120million has been secured to fund Major League Cricket, while four of the teams have landed investment from the Indian Premier League - cricket's biggest franchise tournament.\n\nThe likes of Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Marsh, Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje have already signed up to play in Major League Cricket, with more superstars expected to follow suit.\n\nAre you excited to watch Major League Cricket? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nPlunkett, who represented England in Tests, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and T20Is will always be remembered for what he achieved during the summer of 2019. The quick featured in seven of England's 11 ODI World Cup games - boasting a 100 per cent individual win rate - and played a vital role in their dramatic final triumph against New Zealand.\n\nBowling during the middle overs, Plunkett dismissed the likes of Rishabh Pant, Hashim Amla, Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson throughout the tournament. His international career concluded after the 2019 World Cup.\n\nAlthough he still wants to play against the best, Plunkett is determined to bring through the next generation of talent in America. He relocated to the United States with his wife, Emeleah, who is American.\n\n\"Let's see how this Major League Cricket goes,\" says Plunkett when asked about his ambitions as a player. \"I want to play a couple of years in the league, I want to see it grow. But also, one of my roles is [being] the national development coach in Major League Cricket.\n\n\"I want to keep helping the guys coming through, I want to try and provide high-performance training for them - however that looks like, we're still trying to figure that out.\n\n\"I'll play until I'm [still] competing and I feel like I can win games. As soon as I feel I can't contribute to a winning team, then I'll probably step away. But right now, I feel like I'm in a good space. In terms of other competitions, I don't think so... I'll put everything into Major League Cricket. I've played in a few masters’ leagues and that ticks me over, but let's see how this goes.\n\n\"Hopefully, I come out and I'm in a good position. If all goes well, you never know where that goes.\"\n\nPlunkett has also ruled out playing for his new country in the T20 World Cup, which is due to be held in the West Indies and the United States in June 2024. He knows an international call-up for the United States would deny an emerging player the chance to grace the international stage.\n\n\"Major League Cricket is who I work for and who I want to play for, and I think that's the biggest competition here. I just don't see it... just to play for a year. You have people grafting who want to play for the USA.\n\n“I'm at a point now... how good am I? Are the people coming through better than me? So, that's the first question - would I get selected? It's easy for me to say, 'Yeah, I'll play'. But you shouldn't be guaranteed a spot - you should have to work for that spot, not just have a name in cricket.\n\n\"I think if I did, I'd come in for that one World Cup and I think that defeats the purpose of developing youth and talent coming through.\"",

    "date": "Sun Jul 16 21:37:27 2023",
    "body": "GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas —The promise of cricket in America could be seen and felt in the most unlikely of circumstances.\n\nAwash in Friday night lights after a scorching Texas sun, the trim green cricket oval invited fanatics and families alike to watch the Seattle Orcas chase the Washington Freedom’s 144 runs.\n\nDeep in the Heart of Texas played cheerfully from the loudspeakers during a brief break in the action, and local law enforcement, sporting straw cowboy hats and boots, looked on in bewilderment.\n\nMajor League Cricket debuted last week, the cricketing world’s American Dream, a new field of dreams.\n\nUnlike the seesaw, to-and-fro of baseball innings, the format of cricket known as T-20 is played politely with one team batting until 20 overs (120 balls) are thrown – around the same number thrown by a baseball team in 9 innings.\n\nDuring a cricket game’s overs, the batting squad attempts to score as many runs as possible while the bowling team, the defense, attempts to take the batting team’s wickets. Batting ends when 10 wickets are taken or 20 overs are completed, whichever comes first.\n\nIn the opening innings, DC had scored 144 runs and lost seven wickets. Now it was up to Seattle’s assortment of Indian, Pakistani, South African, Sri Lankan, West Indies, and U.S. players to beat that score. Seattle displayed an offense not unlike past Mariners teams — slow but steady small ball.\n\nAfter eight overs, Seattle still needed 101 runs. With two overs remaining, they needed 17. Imad Wasim of Pakistan and Shimron Hetmyer from the West Indies formed a partnership that produced a pair of 6s (baseball’s equivalent of a homerun), and Shubham Ranjane came up with the winning hit for four (something like a ground rule double) after Hetmyer was dismissed.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas won their inaugural match Friday night with 148 runs and five lost wickets. They followed their thrilling victory with another win Saturday night over the San Francisco Unicorns, this time in a more decisive manner, 177 runs and four wickets. The Orcas took all ten San Francisco wickets after the Unicorns put up just 142 runs. Orcas batsman Heinrich Klaasen of South Africa scored the franchise’s first “half-century,” putting up 53 runs.\n\nIn 2015, I wrote an article seeking to answer a question: Could cricket in the U.S. be a worthwhile investment? I flew to New York City to watch a tour of the world’s cricketing all-stars because, having fallen in love with the sport thanks to business travel to India and England, I was curious about its viability in America.\n\nNot long ago, the idea that Major League Soccer franchises would pop up in cities across America, each competing for international talent, was a dream to some, and a joke to others. Cricket? It’s too complicated. Don’t matches stretch on for days? It will never work.\n\nBut might the MLC and the Indian diaspora attract a legend at the end of his career, like MLS and its “soccer is life” Latino population attracted Messi to Miami?\n\nThe night before Seattle’s match, the Texas Super Kings played the LA Knight Riders to commence tournament play. Ross Perot Jr.’s Super Kings beat the Knight Riders by a score of 181 runs and the loss of six wickets to 112 runs with the loss of all 10 wickets.\n\nThanks to an agreement with the Indian Premier League (IPL), several of the American teams share IPL mascots. Chenai and Texas are the Super Kings, Mumbai and New York are the Indians, Kolkata and Los Angeles are the Knight Riders.\n\nAll six teams — Texas, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. — began this week’s tournament in Texas, to be continued in North Carolina, and then return to Texas for the playoffs on July 27.\n\nThe scene in Grand Prairie\n\nMajor League Cricket debuted to a sellout crowd of around 7,000 fans with the kind of diversity the NFL, the NBA, and MLB can only dream about. Television networks from around the world, including America’s Willow cable channel, broadcast the game live to hundreds of millions in cricket-mad places like India, Australia and New Zealand, the U.K., and South Africa. International news outlets have run coverage almost hourly through the weekend.\n\nMLC took over an abandoned independent league baseball stadium (the Airhogs) in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, and invested heavily in a world class cricket oval. There, fans in Dallas Cowboys gear and Bass Pro Shop hats mixed with the national team jerseys from every cricket nation. Country and Western, Bollywood, and hip-hop blasted overhead. Fans munched on chickpeas and rice seasoned with Tex-Mex Chipotle hot sauce.\n\nThe Dallas metroplex made for a surprising backdrop. Looming over the new cricket stadium is Lone Star Park, a hulking horse racing venue. Soaring above the racetrack’s spire, commercial jets take off and land from nearby DFW Airport.\n\nInside the arena, an English gentleman from Birmingham, more recently residing in Jacksonville, stayed over in Dallas when he learned he could catch the first-ever Major League Cricket game.\n\nTim Miller, 54, and his son Iain, 18, live locally in the Dallas metroplex and were standing near the field an hour before the action began. Iain began playing with friends, mostly Indian, in a nearby park as the pandemic began. He fell in love with the game and has now tried out for an Under-19 team. He and his father watch cricket on Willow.\n\nMark Roberts and his kids, 10 and 13, drove 12 hours from Fort Collins, Colo., to see the launch. Dad took an interest in 2018 when he stumbled across the sport on Willow. He wanted to introduce his kids to cricket because “it’s a better alternative to baseball.” Why? The action.\n\nLike a winter league baseball game in the Caribbean, fans blew whistles and anticipated, and then reacted to, every play of the game.\n\nBy all accounts, the cricket grounds and the quality of play were top-notch. Likewise, the league clearly invested in slick, professional video and merchandise.\n\nCricket in the Pacific Northwest\n\nOrcas cricket is backed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Madrona Venture Group Managing Director S. Soma Somasegar; Icertis co-founder and CEO Samir Bodas; GreatPoint Ventures managing partner Ashok Krishnamurthi; and former Microsoft and Avalara executive Sanjay Parthasarathy.\n\nSoma and his family attended both Orcas games over the weekend.\n\n“Seattle was initially not a day 1 city for the league,” he said. “But because of the strong and vibrant fan base and sports community in Seattle we made Seattle a day 1 city for the league. We have an important fan base to build upon.”\n\nHe pointed out that the U.S. and Seattle should be part of the world’s second most popular sport.\n\n“Sports bring people from different perspectives together” he said. “ We want to unify.”\n\nTech hubs like Seattle and Silicon Valley in California have long attracted software programmers from India. The Asian Indian population in the U.S. has grown steadily, rising from 2 million in 2000 to more than 5 million.\n\nIn the Seattle area, Microsoft is incorporating a recreational cricket pitch on its new campus in Redmond. King County’s Marymoor Park, where Seattle’s amateur league has played for decades, envisions its own professionally-run stadium.\n\nWhat’s next for MLC?\n\nSeattle will play three more matches in Morristown, N.C., over the weekend. The teams return to Texas for the championship round.\n\nBeyond that, it’s a little uncertain.\n\nMLC franchises expect to have their grounds in order by the 2025 season. Tom Dunmore, who heads MLC marketing, said the hope is that 2025 will be the first regular season.\n\nNext year, the U.S. and the West Indies (Jamaica, Bahamas, Antigua) will co-host cricket’s World Cup. The International Cricket Committee (ICC), the equivalent of soccer’s FIFA, is currently working to identify host cities. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland are possibilities. With the Oakland Athletics heading to Las Vegas, that could open up a suitable stadium. The Oakland Coliseum is known for its generous foul territory, which would enable a proper cricket oval.\n\nDunmore says MLC will wait to see what the ICC comes up with, and perhaps next year’s MLC tournament could be played on a World Cup pitch.\n\n“Not to be cliché, but if you build it people will come,” Dunmore said.\n\nA little more on how the game is played\n\nIf you’ve played the game all your life, feel free to skip this. If not, read on. More than 10 years ago on a trip to New Delhi, I downloaded Cricket for Dummies in order to be conversant on the subject since the Australian national team was touring India. The test match, this one played over weeks, was all anyone wanted to talk about.\n\nLearning a little about the game helped. In Texas, some fans dressed in Jacob deGrom and Ronald Acuna Jr. baseball jerseys said they watched how-to videos on YouTube to get up to speed.\n\nHere’s a short lesson that might be helpful.\n\nAs in baseball, a batsman (batter) stands before a bowler (pitcher) and swings at pace balls (fastballs) and spin or swing balls (curves and sliders) attempting score runs.\n\nThe batsman can score 1-3 runs with hits inside the boundary (fence) or 4 runs at once if a fielder fails to stop the ball from exiting the boundary. If the batsman clears the boundary in the air, it’s 6 runs.\n\nWhat are wickets? Well, wickets are taken by the defense. The defense can take a wicket by catching the ball in the air, smacking the stumps behind the batsman or hitting the batsman’s leg pads without contact with the bat.\n\nA batsman can stand at the crease (like baseball’s plate) all day if the defense cannot take the wicket.\n\nWho wouldn’t like to watch Aaron Judge or Seattle native All-Star Corbin Carroll stand at the plate for the entire game because no one could get him out?\n\nFor further reading",

    "body": "Cricket is making its big splash in the United States, with Major League Cricket set to play its first match this week. Sanjay Govil, Washington Freedom Owner & Executive Chairman of Infinite Computer Systems, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the league and the sport's popularity in the United States and abroad.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Professional cricket is coming to the United States. The inaugural match for Major League Cricket, it's set to air today. The league, which was initially meant to debut in 2021, was shut down due to the COVID pandemic. It's now coming back for its first season. Hosted out of stadiums in Texas and North Carolina, Major League Cricket will span 18 days, have 19 matches, and will show the best of the best from six different professional cricket teams.\n\nWe're joined by someone who believes cricket will crack into the US audience. That is Washington Freedom owner, that's one of the new teams, as well as founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Systems, Sanjay Govil. Thank you so much for being here, Sanjay. It's pretty cool, it's not every day that you see a new sport and a new professional league come to fruition.\n\nSo how did this happen? How did the league come together? How did you get involved?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: So obviously, first of all, thank you so much for having us and promoting cricket in the US. We are very excited. We have been at this for many, many years. US does have a history of cricket. There used to be a Philadelphia Cricket Club in the 1800s when cricket was semi-popular in the US.\n\nAnd for the last 15, 20 years, there have been a lot of cities and leagues where cricket is actually played. And this was the time when we felt that we have an opportunity for a Major League Cricket league and to have the Washington freedom team based right here in Washington DC.\n\n- And so when we think about the makeup of this league and what's going to make it successful, what does the first season, two seasons, what do you believe that that has to hold? What does that have to entail in order for it to get off to a booming start?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: I think awareness. Being on Yahoo Finance today, that's one step towards that. There's already a lot of buzz which is being created. Most of our matches, if not all, are sold out, considering the fact that we only got going in terms of ticket sales about a month back. So there's a lot of excitement, a lot of buzz, and it's leading to a numerous things. Next year, the World Cup is happening. The T20 World Cup. US is one of the home grounds for that. And then 2028 Olympics, hopefully cricket will become part of that.\n\nSo there's just a lot of excitement, and our goal is to create that buzz, create what people want, give a product bring world class stars. And also the most important thing is to promote US cricket.\n\n- And as we talked about, for now, the teams are going to be playing in just a couple of locations. If people are not there, how can they watch these cricket matches? How is the sort of airing rights worked out?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: Sure. So in the US, we are telecasting on Willow TV and also on CBS. A few games are coming on CBS. And then we have media partners across the world. So we're going to have a substantial number of people watching. 2.5 billion people who watch cricket or big fans of cricket across the world. Second most popular sport in the world after soccer.\n\nSo we see a huge opportunity, and we see a lot of passion already happening in terms of cricket.\n\n- So that's really interesting, Sanjay. So you're expecting not just to benefit from people who are cricket fans in the US, but globally who are interested in this league. Are you drawing on the people who are playing in these leagues? Are they also members of cricket teams across the globe?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: Absolutely. I would say most of them have played or are playing for their countries today. And not only that, we have players who have played in the Indian Premier League and other leagues across the world. So these are really, really household names who we have here in the US.\n\nSo we are very honored and privileged that in our very first year, we have the quality of players who have come. And we are really, really excited to see that. And the American audience is really, really excited to see those players play, because we only see them on TV or if we have gone to countries where they are playing. But now to have them come to the US and play here is really a big thing for us.\n\n- Talk to us about the fan experience. I mean, when people go to a sporting event, they want to be close to the players, they want to have that access into them, they want to be able to watch them from wherever as well if they can't go to the match. So what does that fan experience look like?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: That's a very good question. So we are actually building a stadium at George Mason University. And just to answer the previous question in terms of where they can watch, right now is Dallas and Morrisville which is near Raleigh, but we are building stadiums across the country. DC is going to have a stadium in the George Mason University Campus. George Mason is the biggest university, public university in Virginia.\n\nAnd the fan experience is going to be all around what we as Americans enjoy, which is fast-paced. No more than three hours, go in there, have our hot dogs, hamburgers, beer. Cheer the teams, have a good time. And family-oriented and kids-oriented. So that's the kind of experience we want to have around our matches.\n\n- I noticed that when I look at the owners here, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft has another-- his team is called the Seattle Orcas. Cricket is huge in India and obviously, you guys are Indian-Americans. And so has a huge cultural importance there as well. How do you sort of broaden the appeal? I mean, you're talking about it in American terms, as a sport, it has the same appeal as a baseball or some other sports like that. So how do you sort of broaden that appeal?\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: We broaden them by making them more aware. I mean, whenever I talk to people who have grown up here, the good news is that they've all heard of cricket, which is great. And there's been a lot of cross connects between the US and cricket-playing countries. There's a big immigrant population, which has actually come here. Their children go to elementary schools, junior school, high schools, colleges, universities. They talk to their friends about cricket. So cricket is a known thing.\n\nThe stigma which cricket had was, oh, my God, it's five days long, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But there's a shorter version, which is the three-hour version, which we are playing here now. So we just have to expand on that.\n\nPickleball, for example, has really caught on just in a matter of two or three years. And we feel that we have a very good product, and we feel that we can really expand the reach of what we have.\n\n- Wow, cricket, the next pickleball. We'll see. I mean, that would be great for you guys as pickleball has grown very quickly. Sanjay, what a pleasure to talk to you. Really fun stuff, and we'll be watching the matches. Washington Freedom owner as well as Infinite Computer Systems founder and chairman, Sanjay Govil, thank you.\n\nSANJAY GOVIL: Thank you so much. And thank you for your time and giving us this opportunity to promote cricket.\n\n- Yes, of course, take care.",

    "date": "Mon Mar 20 17:12:50 2023",
    "body": "The Major League Cricket Draft took place earlier today in the United States of America, where six teams formed their squads for the inaugural edition of MLC. Four of the six franchises are owned by teams that have an IPL franchise.\n\nMumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals, and Kolkata Knight Riders have invested in the USA's new league. The names of their teams are MI New York, Team Texas, Seattle Orcas, and Los Angeles Knight Riders. The other two teams are Washington Freedom and San Franciso Unicorns.\n\nThe USA is still growing as a cricketing nation and does not have too many top-tier local talents, but several international stars like Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Wanindu Hasaranga, Anrich Nortje, Quinton de Kock, and Mitchell Marsh will make the competition special.\n\nApart from that, several other cricketers who left their nation and joined the USA will also be in action.\n\nFormer South African speedster Rusty Theron, former New Zealand star Corey Anderson, former England pacer Liam Plunkett, and former Pakistan player Sami Aslam are some names who have earned contracts in the Major League Cricket Draft.\n\nA few former Indian domestic cricketers have also made it to the Major League Cricket 2023 squads. Here is the complete list.\n\n#1 Unmukt Chand - Los Angeles Knight Riders\n\nThe biggest Indian name to earn a contract was Unmukt Chand. The Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) signed him at the MLC 2023 Draft. During his time as an active Indian cricketer, Chand played for three IPL franchises.\n\nHe made his debut for the Delhi Daredevils and then moved to the Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians. Later this year, Chand will make his debut for LAKR.\n\n#2 Harmeet Singh - Seattle Orcas\n\nHarmeet Singh was the first draft pick in the Major League Cricket 2023. Seattle Orcas signed the all-rounder, who was born in Mumbai. He bats left-handed and bowls left-arm spin.\n\nLike Unmukt Chand, Singh was a part of the Rajasthan Royals squad once during his IPL career. He even represented Mumbai and Tripura in domestic cricket.\n\n#3 Tajinder Singh - San Francisco Unicorns\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns snapped up former Indian all-rounder Tajinder Singh at the MLC 2023 Draft. Singh was born in Rajasthan and played domestic cricket for his home state.\n\nThe right-arm off-spin bowler represented a couple of franchises, namely Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians, in the IPL.\n\n#4 Chaitanya Bishnoi - San Francisco Unicorns\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi is a batting all-rounder from Delhi, who has been a member of the Chennai Super Kings squad from 2018 to 2019. He is a former IPL champion as well.\n\nBishnoi will don the San Francisco Unicorns jersey in MLC 2023. He has the experience of playing in 50 T20 matches.\n\n#5 Saurabh Netravalkar - Washington Freedom\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar captained India U-19s in the U-19 World Cup 2010. Current Indian superstars KL Rahul and Mayank Agarwal played under his leadership for India U-19s.\n\nWhile Rahul and Agarwal are now among the highest-paid players in the IPL, Netravalkar has retired from Indian cricket. He has joined the USA team and will play for Washington Freedom in the Major League Cricket.\n\n#6 Sarabjeet Ladda - MI New York\n\nSarabjeet Ladda is a former Indian leg-break bowler, who played for the Delhi Daredevils, Gujarat Lions and Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. Ladda also represented Punjab at the domestic level.\n\nThe 36-year-old has now moved to the United States. He will make his Major League Cricket debut for MI New York.\n\n#7 Smit Patel - San Francisco Unicorns\n\nSmit Patel was a member of the India U-19s squad that lifted the ICC U-19 World Cup 2012 under Unmukt Chand's captaincy. Like Chand, Patel has now left India and settled in the USA.\n\nPatel played for the Barbados Royals in the Caribbean Premier League. He will represent San Francisco Unicorns in the MLC.\n\n#8 Milind Kumar - Team Texas\n\nFormer Delhi Daredevils and Royal Challengers Bangalore player Milind Kumar was picked up by Team Texas at the Major League Cricket 2023 Draft. Kumar is an off-spin bowling all-rounder.\n\nHe has played 58 T20 matches in his career, scoring 1,176 runs and scalping five wickets. It will be interesting to see how he performs in the Major League Cricket.",

    "title": "An Olympic opportunity for Jamaica's cricket",
    "date": "Sun Oct 22 00:07:00 2023",
    "body": "CRICKET is back in the Olympics and Jamaica must seize this opportunity.\n\nIt was predictable, and the International Cricket Council (ICC) had been working on it for years. In Twenty20 (T20) they found a workable, widely played format with such revenue virility it became an irresistible progeniture. While content acquisition budgets are exploding and being gobbled up by both old and new individual leagues with addressable fan bases, Olympic revenue growth is burdened by too many un-monetisable sports. Even our hallowed track and field as an individual sport isn’t amongst the top ten watched globally.\n\nThe English Premier League (football) and Indian Premier League (cricket) with their US$6-billion domestic rights deals, and even Major League Soccer’s US$2.5-billion agreement with AppleTVillustrate the siphoning of resources by even previously unheralded sports leagues. With the ever-increasing cost of hosting, it was inevitable the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would welcome back cricket to tap into its massive viewership and burgeoning coffers. Experts are already predicting a tenfold increase in Olympic rights in India – a US$200-million-dollar impact. Coinciding with T20 being confirmed as the latest Olympic sport, the United States is co-hosting the T20 World Cup in 2024. No sooner had Major League Cricket concluded its first successful season in the US, a new “American Cricket League” is announced. Perhaps it’s just a remarkable coincidence or maybe these are unencrypted, not-so-secret transmissions for which we require no special enigma cypher.\n\nImpact on Jamaican Cricket\n\nBeing an Olympic sport fosters investment and development. Since only individual nations can participate in the Olympics as a rule, West Indies cricket, that amorphous, non-existent nation, must tap its component countries to extract the precious and badly needed benefits. There should be no thought of abandoning Jamaica’s Olympic legacy and competing under a “WI” umbrella. We are Olympic royalty; the black, green and gold hoisted above all others to the crescendo of “Jamaica, land we love” is as much our identity as being synonymous with the Olympics itself.\n\nICC craved Olympic recognition to accelerate growth in the sport globally, especially among its 96 associate member countries. As an Olympic sport these governing bodies will have stronger cases to harvest national resources from both public and private sector purses, not to mention the potential sliver of Olympic revenues. The Olympic imprint carries a special aura that transcends commercial, corporate social responsibility and government budgets, bringing unique funding dexterity. It’s also why the NFL lobbied the IOC so hard and successfully to have American “flag football” included.\n\nOlympic Qualification\n\nThe Jamaica Cricket Association (JCA) and its regional counterparts should propose and lobby the ICC and IOC for the structuring of Olympic qualification to favour our interest. Notwithstanding the initial limit of six male and female teams for 2028, let’s think medium and long term. Olympic soccer started with eight teams back in 1908, which has since doubled. It could be eight T20 national teams by the Brisbane edition in 2032, growing to 10 or 12 by 2036, Mumbai being the hot favourite to host. Surely, Jamaica has the capability to plot our path to at least the latter as an Olympic cricket team.\n\nLet’s propose that the only automatic Olympic qualifiers be the top four ICC-ranked teams. Where it gets interesting is how we might determine the non-automatic qualifiers. The ICC currently holds geographic regional qualifiers for the T20 World Cup. Indeed, teams like Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Panama, Argentina, etc battle through these regionals (Americas, Asia, etc). A Caribbean Olympic Qualification Region should be added. Given that there are 14 countries under CWI, our contribution to world cricket, and with no other way to participate, we deserve our own qualification region. Imagine the new prestige of Jamaica vs Barbados in a “T20 Olympic Qualifier” under the lights at Sabina Park. The life it could breathe back into regional cricket is immeasurable! The top two from the Caribbean region would join the other ranked ICC teams and regional qualifiers in a tournament for the remaining spots on the Olympic stage. In T20 any team, on any day, in the right conditions, can win. That’s the simplistic beauty T20 has brought to the game, levelling the playing field. So why can’t we see Jamaica beating England in a T20 eliminator for a shot at Olympic glory!\n\nThe same should be done for T20 World Cup qualifiers. Imagine our Caribbean teams battling it out in T20 World Cup qualification every two years and the Olympics every four. Don’t be surprised. And maybe it’s inevitable, given the meteoric rise of T20, if the Pan American Games gets added to the mix. That would be a non-stop, competitive international calendar for national T20 teams. Ultimately, this must benefit WI cricket. Of course there is the sticky issue of the CPL and any prohibitions on inter-country, competitive T20 matches. But surely there is a difference between franchise cricket and a national team playing to qualify for the Olympic Games.\n\nIf we continue to ignore it all and pretend nothing has changed we could see lesser teams like Oman, Japan and even Denmark one day make their Olympic mark in a sport we once dominated, while we wistfully muse on the glory days and what might have been. We need to look no further than the Netherlands’ rise to see the future. I believe we should dream big and be proactive if we are to benefit from cricket returning to the Olympics. It will not be easy and won’t happen overnight. It will require strategy, determination and courage.\n\nBut perhaps it is a last, beckoning chance to return Jamaica and WI cricket to relevance.",

On Saturday USA Cricket announced the 24 franchises and owners of Minor League Cricket, only one of which is listed as fully owned by the league (Sacramento). Team names range from the refreshingly relevant Philadelphians and Morrisville Cardinals, to the curious Atlanta Param Veers, a reference to India’s highest military honour.\n\nThe field of 24 has been announced one week before the new August 22 date for the official Minor League Cricket draft, and includes some notable owners such as former USACA board members, former national team cricketers, CPL franchise owners, and a few LLCs with no names attached. The draft date was recently moved back in order to “provide teams with additional time to evaluate players and allow further planning in advance of the Draft,” per the announcement.\n\nTentative exhibition games are being planned for September and October, perhaps in time for the return of the six ICC Americas players currently in Trinidad for the Caribbean Premier League, depending on Minor League Cricket’s quarantine guidelines. The CPL has taken great measures to ensure the safety of players and staff, requiring overseas players to arrive two weeks prior to the competition and quarantine in their hotels. CPL will stage two games per day between only two Trinidad venues, a bubble approach which will expedite the league schedule and increase viewership in India, due to the earlier local start times and the time zone difference. Minor League Cricket has yet to announce their own Covid-19 related protocols, outside of the fact that travel would be limited to inter-division teams, and that the exhibition “matches will only proceed in conjunction with all local, county, and state authorities’ guidelines.”\n\nThe full list of teams, their cities and owners, as per the USA Cricket release is as follows;\n\nKeep up with news and events happening in the emerging game through our Facebook and Twitter pages.\n\nLooking for audio content on the emerging game?

Seattle, Washington and was announced in 2023 as one of six inaugural franchises to play in Major League Cricket.[2] The Seattle Orcas are owned by an investor group including Satya Nadella, Soma Somasegar, Samir Bodas, Ashok Krishnamurthi, and Sanjay Parthasarathy – and the GMR Group.[3] The Orcas have a minor league affiliate called the Seattle Thunderbolts,[4] who play in Minor League Cricket and were the 2022 champions.[5]\n\nThe team plans to have their home ground at Marymoor Park in Redmond, Washington.[6] The park's cricket ground is set to have a capacity of up to 6,000 people once it is completed around 2025.[7] The team is coached by former Indian cricketer Pravin Amre.[8]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nIn November 2021, the Bellevue City Council passed a resolution to support further research into the cost and feasibility for a cricket facility in Seattle.[9] This was followed by a similar resolution that the Redmond City Council adopted in January 2022.[10] A motion of support to develop a cricket facility in Marymoor Park was then passed by King County in February 2022.[6][11] In May 2022, Major League Cricket announced that Somasegar and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella were among some of the lead investors launching Major League Cricket in the U.S.[12]\n\nIn March 2023, MLC unveiled the team ownership, name, and logo prior to the inaugural MLC domestic draft.[13] It was also announced that the team would partner with the GMR Group, who co-owns the Delhi Capitals of the Indian Premier League.[14] Co-owner Somasegar stated that the Orcas name and colors \"pay tribute to our local community [of Seattle] that has helped build that spirit of support\".[15] On May 27, 2023, it was revealed that the Orcas had revamped their logo to emphasize its focus on cricket.[16]\n\nSeason History[edit]\n\n2023 season[edit]\n\nSee also: 2023 Seattle Orcas Season\n\nPrior to the launch of the official season, it was announced the MLC's inaugural domestic draft would take place on March 19, 2023.[17] The Orcas' had the first pick of the draft and selected Thunderbolts captain Harmeet Singh as their first overall draft pick, before adding the likes of Shehan Jayasuriya, Angelo Perera, and Shubham Ranjane in later draft selections.[18] In addition, Mitchell Marsh and Quinton de Kock were announced as some of the team's overseas signings during the draft.[19] Over the following months, several more overseas signings occurred, including the signings of Wayne Parnell, Dasun Shanaka, and Heinrich Klaasen – amongst others.[20][21][22]\n\nThe team also announced their lineup of support staff, with Johan Botha coming onboard as the team's bowling coach, Ross Taylor as the team's batting coach, Pravin Amre as the team's head coach, and Jarrod Harkness as the team analyst.[8]\n\nPrior to the start of the season, Mitchell Marsh and Sikandar Raza – who were both included in the Orcas squad – withdrew from MLC due to it clashing with other tournaments such as the Ashes and the Zim Afro T10.[23]\n\nIn the start to their inaugural campaign, the Orcas' went top of the table by recording a 5-wicket win over the Washington Freedom,[24] a 35-run win over the San Francisco Unicorns,[25][26] and an 8-wicket win over the Texas Super Kings.[27] The Orcas' winning streak was snapped, however, during a 2-wicket defeat to the Los Angeles Knight Riders.[28] A 2-wicket win over MI New York assured the Orcas' a first-place finish going into the finals nevertheless.[29]\n\nCurrent squad[edit]\n\nPlayers with

    "title": "Moeen Ali latest England star to be targeted by America's Major League Cricket",
    "date": "Fri May 26 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Moeen Ali is the latest England star to be targeted by America's Major League Cricket and his Indian Premier League side are planning to offer him a multi-franchise deal that would include him joining Texas Super Kings.\n\nOn Thursday Jason Roy terminated his England incremental contract to play in the United States, provoking fears others may follow suit.\n\nAnd Moeen – unlike Roy, a centrally contracted player – is wanted by Texas, who are owned by Chennai Super Kings. Chennai also own a side in the South African 20 league, the Joburg Super Kings, and want to recruit Moeen for that side too.\n\nTexas tried to sign Moeen for this season’s Major League Cricket tournament but, as a centrally contracted England player, Moeen was not permitted to play. But Texas are very hopeful that Moeen will be signed in time for the 2024 season.\n\nMoeen is under a central contract until October 1. He is a crucial part of England’s plans for this year’s 50-over World Cup in India, but could well retire from the ODI game after the tournament. “It could be a time where I'm thinking that's me done now,” he said in March.\n\nThe 2024 T20 World Cup will be played in June in the West Indies and America, and Moeen could still be involved in that competition. But the tournament could mark the natural end-point for his international career, with England planning to regenerate their side after the T20 World Cup. Moeen turns 36 next month and would be at, or near, 39 years old by the time of the 2026 T20 World Cup.\n\nThe 2024 edition of Major League Cricket is due to begin soon after the World Cup, and Super Kings hope that Moeen will feature for Texas in the competition. Unless England change their stance on centrally contracted players being barred from appearing in Major League Cricket – which is unlikely, given the clash with the England domestic summer – Moeen could only appear if he no longer had his international contract or had retired from international duty.\n\nMoeen is one of the most-coveted T20 players in the world, highly-valued for his adaptability and selflessness. While renowned for his hitting of spin, he can also be destructive against pace, and is happy moving up or down the order as required. His off-spin, which is deployed both with the new ball and in the middle overs, provides essential balance for a side. Moeen is in his third season with Chennai, and was the first Englishman to play on the winning side in the final in 2021.\n\nMoeen rejoined Warwickshire this season and captains the Birmingham Bears, the side’s T20 team, in the T20 Blast. This year, rather than play in South Africa's T20 league, he appeared in the ILT20 in UAE, but Super Kings are hopeful that he will also be able to represent Joburg in future seasons, meaning that he would represent all three Super Kings sides.\n\nChennai Super Kings have already shown that they intend to contact leading figures across their franchises in other T20 leagues. Stephen Fleming, Chennai’s head coach, performs the same role for both Joburg and Texas.",
    "summary": "* Moeen Ali, an England star, is being targeted by Texas Super Kings, a team in the Major League Cricket tournament, to join their side.\n* The deal would also include playing for Joburg Super Kings in the South African T20 league, as both teams are owned by Chennai Super Kings.\n* Moeen was not allowed to play in the current season's Major League Cricket tournament due to his central contract with England, but Texas Super Kings are hopeful to sign him for the 2024 season.\n* The 2024 edition of Major League Cricket is scheduled to begin soon after the 2024 T20 World Cup, which could mark the end of Moeen's international career.",

    "body": "The inaugural edition of Major League Cricket (MLC) will begin on Friday. The six-team tournament will feature eight Indian players who have recently announced retirement from Indian cricket to pursue their cricketing careers in USA.\n\nSome of the prominent names are India U-19 World Cup-winning captain Unmukt Chand and his teammates Smit Patel and Harmeet Singh. Ambati Rayudu had signed up with Texas Super Kings but pulled out of the tournament last week due to personal reasons.\n\nActive Indian players are barred from playing in overseas franchise leagues, including MLC, but the ones who have announced their retirement are allowed.\n\nHere are the Indian players who will be in action in MLC 2023:\n\nUnmukt Chand (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nThe former India Under-19 World Cup skipper was picked by Los Angeles Knight Riders for $65,000 in the MLC player draft. The right-handed batter had announced his retirement from Indian cricket in August 2021 and moved to the USA.\n\nChand had a brief stint in the Indian Premier League (IPL) between 2011 and 2016, where he played 21 matches for Delhi Capitals (2011-13), Rajasthan Royals (2014) and Mumbai Indians (2015-16). He had little success, however, scoring 300 runs at a strike rate of 100.00 and averaging 15.00. The Delhi-born batter has also played franchise cricket in Australia (Big Bash League) and Bangladesh (Bangladesh Premier League).\n\nUnmukt Chand T20 career stats\n\nHarmeet Singh (Seattle Orcas)\n\nChand’s 2012 Under-19 World Cup teammate was one of the six players to be picked in the first round of the MLC player draft for $75,000 by Seattle Orcas. The left-arm spinner has played just one IPL game, for Rajasthan Royals in 2013. He picked one for 34 from his four overs in his lone experience in the league.\n\nOnce compared to spin legend Bishen Singh Bedi, Harmeet made his First-Class debut for Mumbai in 2009 and picked seven wickets in the game against Himachal Pradesh. From 2017-18, he played for Tripura in the Indian domestic circuit till 2020 before retiring from Indian cricket in 2021 and moving to USA.\n\nHarmeet Singh T20 career stats\n\nSmit Patel (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe wicketkeeper-batter also shot to fame during India’s Under-19 World Cup win in 2012 under the leadership of Chand. He was India’s second highest run-scorer in the tournament, after Chand, scoring 178 runs in six games at an average of 59.33. He made his First-Class debut for Gujarat in the same year before playing for Tripura as a “guest player” in search of more opportunities. He ended his First-Class career in 2020 with Goa with a game against his original team Gujarat.\n\nSmit ended his Indian domestic career with Baroda in 2021 before deciding to move to USA. In 2021, he plied his trade for Barbados Royals in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL).\n\nSmit Patel T20 career stats\n\nSarbjeet Singh Ladda (MI New York)\n\nThe leg-spinner from Punjab has an impressive First-Class record with 89 wickets in just 28 games. Ladda made his debut in 2007 and was Punjab’s second highest wicket-taker in the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy season. He earned an IPL cap in 2010 with Delhi Capitals and picked four wickets in five games at an economy rate of 9.53 in his debut season. He then played three matches for Kolkata Knight Riders between 2011 and 2013 but managed just one wicket.\n\nHis last IPL appearance was for Gujarat Lions in 2016. He played just one match that season and was wicketless in the two overs that went for 21 runs. That was also his last T20 match. Ladda’s First-Class career ended in 2015 while his last List A game was back in 2010.\n\nSarbjeet Singh Ladda T20 career stats\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nBishnoi played the most recent Indian domestic season, opening the batting for Haryana across formats. He was his side’s top run-scorer in the T20 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with 217 runs in eight matches but at an underwhelming strike rate of 104.32. In the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy, Bishnoi was Haryana’s third leading run-getter and scored 213 runs in six innings and also struck a hundred (134). In the Ranji Trophy, Bishnoi amassed 282 runs in eight innings, averaging 35.25 and picked three wickets with his left-arm spin.\n\nThe 28-year-old was bought by Chennai Super Kings for his base price of Rs. 20 lakh in 2018 and was retained by the side for the 2019 season but never played an IPL match.\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi T20 career stats\n\nTajinder Singh Dhillon (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nThe lower-order batter from Rajasthan has an impressive career strike rate of 144.16 in T20s and is also a handy off-spinner who has a career economy of 6.52 in the shortest format of the game. He was picked for Rs. 55 lakh by Mumbai Indians in the 2018 auctions before Punjab Kings acquired his services for Rs. 20 lakh in 2020. Despite his penchant for big-hitting, Tajinder never played an IPL match. He made his First-Class, List A and T20 debut for Rajasthan in 2017 and plied his trade in the Indian domestic circuit till 2019.\n\nTajinder Singh Dhillon T20 career stats\n\nMilind Kumar (Texas Super Kings)\n\nMilind is a proven performer on the Indian domestic circuit. The all-rounder made his First-Class debut for Delhi in 2011 and has also represented Sikkim and Tripura in the Ranji Trophy. The right-handed batter amassed 1,331 runs for Sikkim in Ranji Trophy 2018-19 in the Plate Division, which is the third highest tally in a single season. In a testament to his all-round abilities, Milind also picked 22 wickets with his off-spin in the same season. The 32-year-old played his last game in Indian domestic cricket in 2021 for Tripura before announcing his retirement.\n\nThe Delhi-born all-rounder was picked by Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore but never made his IPL debut. Milind has an impressive average in First-Class and List A cricket, 46.68 and 43.04, respectively. In T20s, he has a strike rate of 112.32, which has surged to 142.97 in Minor League Cricket.\n\nMilind Kumar T20 career stats\n\nShubham Ranjane (Seattle Orcas)\n\nRanjane is of rich cricketing heritage. His grandfather Vasant played seven Test matches for India between 1958 and 1964 while his father Subash reperesented Maharashtra in 29 First-Class and 11 List A games. Following in his footsteps, Shubham played 15 First-Class, 23 List A and 29 T20 games for Maharashtra. The all-rounder is a handy lower-order batter and is economical with his right-arm medium pace. Ranjane ended his career in Indian cricket with Goa in 2022. He was picked by Rajasthan Royals in the 2019 auctions but never received an IPL cap.",

The move had been widely tipped, with Smith having signed as a brand ambassador for Freedom last year, and with Australia's international schedule allowing a clear window for him to participate through July.\n\nNew South Wales (NSW), Smith's domestic team in Australia, have a high-performance partnership with Freedom, although NSW coach Greg Shipperd was replaced by Ricky Ponting in February.\n\n\"I'm super excited about joining the Washington Freedom for season two of the MLC,\" Smith said in a video posted on the Freedom's social media channels. \"I can't wait to meet all of my new team-mates and play in front of some incredible crowds in America. I'm also really looking forward to working with Ricky Ponting again, and his amazing staff.\"\n\nFreedom recently announced the signing of Rachin Ravindra, the New Zealand allrounder. They retained two overseas players from the 2023 season in Marco Jansen and Akeal Hosein.\n\nSmith, who owns an apartment in New York, has previously said it would be \"pretty cool\" to play in the USA.\n\nHowever, he faces a fight to earn a spot in Australia's final 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup, which will be held in June, having been unable to play much T20 cricket in recent times. Since his prolific return to the BBL for Sydney Sixers in the 2022-23 season, where he made 346 runs at a strike rate of 174.74, Smith has played two T20Is in India, two matches in last season's BBL and as many games against New Zealand in February, where he made 11 and 4 while opening the batting.\n\nBut after the New Zealand series, he said he was relaxed about whichever way the selection call for the T20 World Cup fell, with Australia having to name their initial squad by May 1.\n\nRelated\n\nMaxwell signs with Washington in MLC, clarifies that form was the reason for IPL self-omission\n\nTravis Head joins Steven Smith at Washington Freedom for Major League Cricket 2024\n\nPonting confirmed as Washington Freedom head coach in MLC\n\nTexas Super Kings snap up Mitchell; Shepherd goes to MI New York\n\nHundred faces MLC clash as 2024 fixtures are announced\n\n\"I think they're pretty settled up top - to be honest - with [Travis] Head, [David] Warner and [Mitchell] Marsh in the top three,'' he had told AAP. \"I'm not really sure what [selectors] want to do. I'm not really too fussed either way. If I'm there, I'm there; if I'm not, I'm not.\"\n\nSmith joins Adam Zampa (Los Angeles Knight Riders), Spencer Johnson (Knight Riders) and Tim David (MI New York) as confirmed Australian signings for the second season of MLC, with more expected to join for the tournament which starts immediately after the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies ends on June 29.",

Although the US has a cricket national team, however it is yet to gain momentum and confidence from most Americans.\n\nThe idea evolved by a group of entrepreneurs and cricket enthusiasts, then the format was agreed that is similar to the IPL held each year in India.\n\nA total of six teams are playing in the MLC for 2023:\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nMI New York\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nWhat makes the MLC more interesting is the owners of each team. Texas Super Kings are co-owned by Chennai Super Kings owners, while LA Knight Riders are co-owned by Bollywood actors Juhi Chawla, Shahrukh Khan and the MI New York co-owned by the Reliance group. Satya Nadella co-owns the Seattle Orcas.\n\nThe inaugural game between Texas Super Kings and LA Knight Riders witnessed over 7500 attendees thronging towards the venue in Dallas, TX. Some of the players who played at the inaugural match included Faf Du Plessis, Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, David Miller, Dwayne Bravo et al, while LA Knight Riders had Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Jason Roy (not present for the inaugural game), Lockie Ferguson, Adam Zampa among others.\n\nThe game turned really interesting with the home crowd cheering for Texas Super Kings who eventually won the game. Many first timers turned up to understand the game and felt it was worth coming down to the stadium.\n\nThe first season will be played for 17 days, where the initial two rounds will be played in Dallas, TX and Morisville, NC. The teams come back to Dallas, TX and lock each other in the eliminators, play-offs and the final that will be played on Sunday, July 30th.\n\nThe audience felt extremely with the preparations made by City of Grand Prairie who own the ground and reminisced good old days. They opined that they have their version of IPL happening in the US and thanked MLC.",

The platform was there today and the opportunity was there. I had to be brave and it worked for me.\"\n\nNew Zealander Boult was the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 22 wickets at an average of 10.36.\n\nUSA international Cameron Gannon, who finished as MLC's second-highest wicket with 11 wickets at 17.36 for Seattle, was named domestic player of the tournament.\n\n\"The quality has been exceptional,\" said Australia-born Gannon.\n\n\"Having overseas players and playing this tournament has been so much fun. I think it is going to be fantastic for USA cricket moving forward.\"\n\nAfter several false dawns, cricket finally looks well placed to establish itself in the United States, spearheaded by its flagship T20 franchise tournament.\n\nAttendances at the two venues have encouraged organisers, with curious American sports fans drawn to the tournament in addition to vast swathes of the South Asian diaspora.\n\nMLC's efforts to gain prominence in the US have also been boosted by some influential names.\n\nSatya Nadella, the chairman and chief executive of Microsoft and co-owner of the Seattle Orcas, bowled the ceremonial first ball before the final at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nFormer India captain Sunil Gavaskar was on hand to award the trophy while Nita Ambani, co-owner of the Mumbai Indians, celebrated with New York's players and posed for selfies with some of the 8,000 fans in attendance.\n\nIndia's prime minister, Narendra Modi even mentioned cricket's growth in the US at a state dinner attended by President Joe Biden at the White House recently.\n\n\"The US has emphatically shown the rest of the cricket world that it is capable of successfully hosting cricket of the highest calibre,\" MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport after the final.\n\n\"To hear from the fans and the players who came to MLC this season on how much it exceeded their expectations, and more importantly, that they can't wait to be back next season is both humbling and energising at once.\n\n\"I can't think of another sport that has come out of the gates like MLC has in the US - practically all matches sold out in both venues, amazing atmospheres and fans actually building allegiances to their home teams even though we are playing in just two venues.\n\n\"We are going to build on this incredible launch season to come back even better in 2024.\"\n\nMLC's founders have already indicated their desire to lure England's best players to the tournament in the future. Even though it clashes with the English summer it could prove hard to resist.",

New York was struggling to put runs on the board as Hammad Azam (2) lost his wicket in the seventh over soon after MI had crossed the 50-run mark. Nicholas Pooran and Captain of MI New York, Kieron Pollard constructed a crucial partnership that steadied the ship for their team.\n\nNew York came back roaring back into the game thanks to Pooran (68), who lost his wicket in the thirteenth over after scoring a blistering half-century and guiding his team past 100 runs.

Anwar (51) scored a crucial half-century before he lost his wicket in the eleventh over right as the Orcas were on the cusp of crossing the 100-run mark.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen was anchoring the Orcas innings, while wickets were falling around him.

Nobody knows and that's the exciting part, it is unknown. There's huge potential.\"\n\nThe USA's new T20 cricket league consists of a 19-game season played over two and a half weeks and features six teams - MI New York, Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, Seattle Orcas, San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom.\n\nWith seasoned T20 franchise and international players on show in Dallas, the cricket in the curtain raiser between the Super Kings and the Knight Riders was of a high calibre, and with no lack of passion on the field.\n\nSuper Kings captain Faf du Plessis fell for a first-ball duck on his birthday before Devon Conway (55) and David Miller (61) got their side to 181-6 as Lockie Ferguson claimed 2-23.\n\nAndre Russell (55) spearheaded the Knight Riders response after a top-order collapse, but when he fell to Dwayne Bravo, the game was up for the LA franchise as they were dismissed for 112 in 14 overs.\n\nUS left-arm wrist spinner Mohammad Mohsin finished with an impressive 4-8 for the Texas franchise.\n\nThe paint was barely dry on the 7,000-capacity Grand Prairie Stadium - the former home of the Texas Airhogs baseball team - after the finishing touches were put on a $20m redevelopment in the hours leading up to a highly anticipated opening fixture.\n\nThere had been a strong American feel to the build-up - the Super Kings players had posed for publicity photos in stetson hats, and the national anthem was played before the match - as is traditional at sports events in the USA.\n\nBut as the sun set and floodlights took over, the night air was filled the sound of whistles and bhangra drums. It looked and sounded more like Delhi than Dallas.\n\nBy the time of the first ball was bowled by USA national team bowler Ali Khan at 19:30 local time on Thursday (01:30 BST on Friday) the venue, officially sold out, was around two-thirds full.\n\nThe majority of the crowd were wearing or waving the yellow of the Super Kings, who are co-owned by their Chennai namesakes.\n\nMLC has some significant backers, including Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, and the organisers have made no secret of their desire to tap into the Indian diaspora numbering 4.6 million in the US.\n\nMany are eager to be associated with the tournament. Australia's Steve Smith, known for his savvy business decisions, announced on Wednesday that he had joined Washington Freedom as a brand ambassador., external\n\nPlunkett, who won the World Cup with England in 2019 before relocating to Philadelphia with his American wife, believes the development and growth of MLC could have lucrative spin-offs for cricketers by connecting them to the US.\n\nThe 38-year-old said: \"Away from cricket, there are all sorts of different sponsorships and partnerships. Who knows where that is going to take some of the superstars of the game?\n\n\"When Americans get excited about something, they go above and beyond. Like the Indians, they are very passionate. With these players coming across, it shows there's a massive excitement. They want to be here because if it takes off, it could be huge.\"",

    "title": "A new cricket league is underway in the busy US sports market. Organizers believe it can stick",
    "date": "Thu Jul 20 10:00:06 2023",
    "body": "GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) — “Deep in the Heart of Texas” blared from the speakers during a timeout a few days into the debut of a U.S. professional cricket league near Dallas.\n\nFans waved the flags of the Texas Super Kings and the LA Knight Riders, with some wearing the jerseys of their favorite countries or clubs overseas. A couple had ballcaps of two of the biggest brands in the United States — the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys and Major League Baseball’s New York Yankees.\n\nThis unusual confluence comes during the debut of Major League Cricket, which is hoping to find a foothold for one of the world’s most popular sports in a sports-mad country that knows little about the “other” bat-and-ball game.\n\nBecause of a willing partner happy to see a fading minor league baseball stadium turned into one of the few legitimate cricket pitches in the country, the league made its start in Texas, famous for the Friday night lights of high school football. The 7,000-seat stadium is in Grand Prairie, not far from where the Cowboys — America’s Team, remember — play in front of 90,000-plus eight or nine times every fall under a retractable roof with a giant video board hanging over the field.\n\n“Some days I think we’re crazy,” tournament director Justin Geale said. “We’re in the middle of Dallas and we’ve got a cricket ground. I saw the vision. I got very excited. I got goose bumps when I first came in here. I thought, ‘We can do this.’”\n\nAs with many things, money is the key, and co-founder Sameer Mehta said investors behind the initial $120 million aren’t expecting to turn a profit for several years, if then. Much of the money is coming from India, where arguably the best T20 cricket — the three-hour version that most closely resembles baseball — is played in the India Premier League. Three IPL owners are helping run U.S. teams.\n\nWith a salary cap that’s competitive with similar T20 tournaments around the world, Major League Cricket organizers secured most of the better-known players they pursued, including Texas Super Kings captain Faf du Plessis.\n\nThe South African was swarmed by autograph seekers during a match against Washington when his playing time was finished. There are U.S. players as well on rosters that allow six spots for international veterans. Mehta said he had no concerns about the quality of play even without IPL players because of rules preventing them from being here.\n\n“There’s some bloody good players out there, especially with the IPL owning some of the franchises here, they bring across some international players,” said Australia’s Matthew Short, the player of the match for Washington in a victory over Texas. “As the tournament gets on the next couple of years, I think it’s important we get those players here and really bring up the local guys here as well.”\n\nPriyank Shah, a native of India who has been working and studying in the U.S. for six years, shouted toward the players he recognized as they walked to and from the locker room. There were plenty of them.\n\n“Besides Indian players, the other players who are playing here, they are like rock stars,” said Shah, who lives in the Dallas area, the metropolitan region that is seeing explosive growth in its Asian population.\n\nThe first eight matches in the six-team tournament were in Texas, with seven more set for Morrisville, North Carolina. The event returns to the Dallas area for elimination games, with the championship July 30.\n\nFor now, the league’s six cities — Washington, Seattle, New York and San Francisco included — are merely represented by the players. The goal is a home-and-home league, with 30 matches per team spanning roughly two months, but that’s several years off. Mehta said the clubs are contractually obligated to open venues within five years.\n\nThe 2024 plan calls for another tournament format, perhaps with two more venues. And organizers hope to build off the T20 World Cup, which will be held in part in the U.S. for the first time.\n\nGeale is hopeful cricket will be added as an Olympic sport for 2028, when the Games are in Los Angeles.\n\n“All of a sudden, we’ve got this five-year growth program for the sport,” Geale said. “A big part of what we’re trying to do is strengthen the USA national team.”\n\nAnother part of the growth plan is more grass roots, which Mehta said will take time. Youth and recreational leagues will be crucial to the U.S. becoming more competitive internationally.\n\nAnd while Houston has a strong enough presence in cricket to have hosted training camps leading to the Major League Cricket debut, the league will need similar facilities in the six cities with teams.\n\n“The odds are stacked against us,” Geale said. “We’re trying to launch a new sport in a country that doesn’t know it needs it. I think we need to be realistic. But I think if we can showcase how cool we think the game is, if we can put out a really good TV product, we can get that to people in America and the world to show this is going to work.”\n\nThere are plenty of examples of how Geale and Mehta want to “Americanize” the sport. One of the best is the ball going into the stands for the cricket version of a home run — all of them are homers since the game is played over all 360 degrees of a circular field.\n\nBaseball fans are used to keeping those balls. Cricket fans are conditioned to throw them back because of the “sanctity of play is that the same ball has to be used unless of course (it’s) out of shape,” Mehta said.\n\nOne day, Geale would love for fans to keep the balls. For now, he was worried about that for the debut — but didn’t need to be. Fans promptly tossed the balls back, which made sense considering what Mehta said about marketing. The target for the debut was ex-patriots of countries in South Asia and the Caribbean, along with Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThat’s another part of the short-term plan.\n\n“What I would love to do is for these fans to quickly bring their friends, family, associates, colleagues along to a game and have them sample this,” Mehta said. “But it’s OK if it takes another year. And by next year, we’ll be doing a lot of general marketing, trying to reach out to mainstream American sports fans.”\n\nThere were a few of those fans in the tournament’s first few days, including Dan Strick. The Dallas-area resident who got hooked on cricket through TV about a year ago brought his son to see a match.\n\n“Based on a year and half of experience, I’ve only watched the best teams in the world play,” Strick said. “So obviously this might be a little poorer. But it’s still fun.”\n\n___",

    "body": "Watch: Pakistan-born American leg spinner Mohammad Mohsin picked two wickets off two balls, one of which involved pinning MI New York captain Kieron Pollard plumb in front first ball, to lead Texas Super Kings’ defence of 154.\n\nBatting first after winning the toss, Texas Super Kings had put up 154-7 at the Grand Prairie Stadium. Devon Conway led the way, scoring 74 off 55 balls, while Faf du Plessis was bowled off a high full toss by Kagiso Rabada for eight. Mitchell Santner chipped in with a crucial 13-ball knock of 27 towards the end.\n\nNew York lost opener Monank Patel for a duck but recovered quickly to set up a solid platform to launch towards the end. They brought down the target to 64 in 42 balls with seven wickets in hand.\n\nMohsin had bowled two overs by then, for 26 runs, 18 of which came in his second over – the 10th of the innings. Shayan Jahangir and Tim David were at the crease when he came on to bowl his third – the 14th of the innings.\n\nJahangir failed to score off the first ball, and stepped out to hit the second. He ended up missing the ball and was stumped by a huge margin.\n\nThat wicket brought New York captain Pollard to the crease. Pollard has a weakness against balls targeted at the stumps by leg spinners. Mohsin played on that weakness, and caught him plumb in front of the very next ball, denting New York’s chances significantly.\n\nHe ended up giving just two runs in that over and gave eight more in his fourth to finish with figures of 2-36. Texas won by 17 runs, a major reason for which turned out to be Mohsin’s double-wicket over.\n\nWatch Mohammad Mohsin take two in two, including pinning Pollard first ball to dent MI New York’s chances:",

    "title": "Kieron Pollard: No league rivals the IPL – but Major League Cricket can have an impact",
    "date": "Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Kieron Pollard has played in, by the best count, 10 Twenty20 leagues around the world. Now, he is about to play in his 11th: Major League Cricket, the first major T20 league in the United States. The tournament launched in the early hours of Friday morning, when Texas Super Kings beat Los Angeles Knight Riders in front of a sold-out 7,000 crowd at a converted baseball stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nThe team names on opening night - the Super Kings and Knight Riders - reflect the involvement of the Indian Premier League in Major League Cricket. IPL owners own four of the MLC teams - including MI New York, who are named after Mumbai Indians are will play in the same blue kit, whom Pollard will captain.\n\n“All the excitement is there,” he says. “Getting people to come out and understand what’s cricket about in America had different challenges before with different tournaments. But this one, with the backing of the Indian franchises - they understand what needs to be done for a tournament to be successful.”\n\nPollard has played in the US before for West Indies against India and in the Caribbean Premier League, at Fort Lauderdale in Florida. Though the India matches attracted sell-out crowds, the CPL games suffered underwhelming crowds, with fans put off by a lack of shade on suffocatingly hot days.\n\nYet this time, Pollard, believes, will be different. The creation of Minor League Cricket, a feeder league for MLC, two years ago has helped to begin the long process of nurturing American talent. The involvement of IPL franchises also gives MLC greater credibility. It has also ensured that MLC’s raft of overseas players is more impressive than the Hundred: Jason Roy, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan, Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway are among those playing, earning salaries up to £135,000 for the 18-day tournament.\n\nNo league, Pollard is sure, will compete with the behemoth of the IPL. But he believes that MLC can slot into the next tier of leagues.\n\n“I don’t think any one of the leagues can rival the IPL if it was very, very honest. With the right structures in place, I think they can be a force to be reckoned with because American sports is big in the world.”\n\nPollard knows the pitfalls of T20 leagues better than most. He played in the Global T20 Canada in 2018, which was since scrapped because of funding problems, and has seen a host of mooted T20 leagues never even make it to the first ball. The involvement of IPL owners - the two other franchises have investment from Cricket New South Wales and Cricket Victoria - gives him confidence that MLC will prove altogether more sustainable.\n\n“It’s about the future,” he says. “It is not just ‘put on a league I want to make a quick buck’. You just want to go there for the long haul, understanding the dynamics of the country, understanding who and what is needed to run the league for a period of time, the quality of the cricket, the quality of the overseas stars, the template of the tournament, and what you’re trying to achieve.\n\n“Hopefully with the influence of the IPL franchises, which have been successful for the last 15 years, they understand the model and it continues to grow.”\n\nFew players grasp this like Pollard, who has played more T20 matches than anyone in history and - now a coach in the IPL, but a player everywhere else - is gently winding down his remarkable career. Even more than his one T20 World Cup in 2012, and five IPL crowns with Mumbai Indians, Pollard’s greatest legacy is as a pioneer.\n\nIn 2010, Pollard rejected a central contract from West Indies to play with Somerset in the T20 Blast instead - effectively, choosing to become a freelance cricketer. One West Indies administrator asked Pollard: “Do you want to be remembered as a legend or do you want to be remembered as someone who is a mercenary?”\n\nNow, of course, administrators are rather more enlightened when players - as Pollard did - make decisions based on what is best for their families. When Jason Roy opted out of his England contract to play in this season’s MLC, England immediately clarified that the decision would not affect their willingness to pick him for international cricket.\n\nPollard stresses, “I’ve never turned down playing for West Indies to play franchise cricket.” Indeed, he played 224 times for West Indies across the two white-ball formats, including a stint as captain from 2019-22.\n\n“Hopefully one day they realise the mistakes they’ve made with the words that they chose,” Pollard reflects of how his embrace of freelance life was viewed. When it is put to him that he was ahead of his time, he says: “we understood the nature of where the sport was going and how things were happening, especially in the Caribbean.\n\n“Now I sit back and I see it’s the way of the world. Because as individuals, we have short careers and you have to think about the future and think about what’s right in front of you.”\n\nWhile Pollard grew up hoping to play Test cricket and actually has a far better first-class average - 37.7 - than many West Indies batsmen picked in recent years, he is fully content with how his career panned out. “I look at things as what is to be will be - and that was something that was not meant to be. I don’t actually lose sleep over it. It didn’t happen due to different circumstances.”\n\nAs West Indies white-ball captain until last year, Pollard still believes that the side can chart a way forward after the debacle of failing to qualify for this year’s ODI World Cup. It needs “everybody coming together,” he says. “The right thinking, the right people, the right strategy, the right plan, and the dedication.\n\n“There’s still a lot of people interested in playing cricket there’s still a lot of youngsters I see them. I interact with them. They need a right and clear pathway in order for that to happen.” For most young Caribbean cricketers, the template of Pollard’s career is altogether more relevant than that of the magnificent generation of Test players in the 1980s.\n\nPollard was one of the very first to spot where the game was heading; his career responded to - and then accelerated - these shifts. To him, MLC is merely another sign of cricket’s continued move towards a structure more like football, with the game revolving more around domestic leagues than the international game.\n\n“I think it’ll carry on going more to franchise cricket,” he reflects. “The leagues and the franchises are going to have a lot more influence - because you have leagues basically 12 months a year.”\n\n“I’m happy it has gotten to this stage and people have realised that T20 cricket is actually here to stay.” Few men have done more than Pollard to ensure that is so.\n\nKieron Pollard is an Investor and Ambassador for Me + U.",

Fans and organizers are hopeful the U.S. and Morrisville won’t be any different.\n\n“This version of cricket we play takes about three to four hours a game, and you will see a lot of families, younger families come together. That’s kind of the next evolution of cricket from the traditional cricket that’s been there for hundreds of years,” said Pal.\n\n“If we had a larger stadium we’d sell that out, if we had a stadium five times the size, we’d sell that out. The community out here is passionate about the sport, and they know a good product when they see one,” Mehta added.\n\nMLC will have its final match in Morrisville Tuesday night before returning to Texas for the remainder of the season.",
    "summary": "* The MLC tournament is in its first season and has seen full attendance in all its games in Texas and North Carolina.\n* A recent game at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, was a sellout, with thousands of fans attending.\n* The league has attracted fans from across the country and world, with one fan even traveling from Canada.\n* The tournament has been well-received in the local community, with fans gathering outside the park to catch a glimpse of the action.\n* Organizers are optimistic about the growth of cricket in the US, with MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta stating that if they had a larger stadium, it would still sell out.\n* The final match in Morrisville will take place on Tuesday night before the tournament returns to Texas for the remainder of the season.",

Operated by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) and sanctioned by USA Cricket, it began play on July 13, 2023, with six teams representing major US cities under a single-entity model.[1] The first season took place over three weeks at Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, concluding on July 30, 2023.[2][3] In 2021, the development league for MLC, Minor League Cricket (MiLC), completed its inaugural season, which was contested by 27 franchise-based teams.[4]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThere have been various attempts to hold a Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in the United States, such as the short-lived Pro Cricket (which played a single season in 2004),[5] and the American Premier League, a proposed league in partnership between the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) and New Zealand Cricket, modelled after domestic T20 competitions. However, it has yet to properly launch in the United States as of February 2024.\n\nFormation: 2018–2021[edit]\n\nIn November 2018, USA Cricket announced that it was seeking partners to establish a domestic T20 league in the country by 2021, with goals to \"engage existing fans and grow new ones\", and spur \"sustainable development of cricketing infrastructure across the United States\".[5] In May 2019, USA Cricket accepted a bid by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) for a US$1 billion investment, covering the league and other investments benefitting the US national teams. Its partners include Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain of The Times Group, and Willow TV founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan.[6][7] As part of the agreement, ACE also handles commercial activities for T20I and ODI matches hosted by the United States.[8]\n\nIn January 2019, USA Cricket was approved as the new governing board for cricket in USA,[9] replacing the USACA, which had been expelled from the International Cricket Council in September 2017 due to governance issues.[10] The new body set a goal for cricket to reach wider, mainstream popularity in the country, where it has typically been considered a niche international sport.[11][12]\n\nIn an annual general meeting on February 21, 2020, it was stated that USA Cricket planned to launch Major League Cricket in 2021, and a 22-team development league known as Minor League Cricket that summer as a prelude.[13] Minor League Cricket was officially announced the following week, with plans to host a nine-week, 170-game season beginning July 4;[14] however, it was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[15][16]\n\nIn October 2020, USA Cricket reaffirmed plans to launch Major League Cricket in 2022 as part of its \"foundational plan\" for 2020–23.[17] On December 1, 2020, it was announced that the IPL's Kolkata Knight Riders (co-owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan) would invest in ACE.[18][19]\n\nIn February 2021, MLC announced plans for Minor League Cricket Youth and Major League Cricket Youth leagues, which would, alongside a MLC Jr. Championship and player development program, serve as a development system for younger players to progress towards Major League Cricket and the national team.[20] In May 2021, the launch of Major League Cricket was delayed to 2023 due to COVID-19 and to provide additional time to develop facilities.[21]\n\nLaunch: 2022–2023[edit]\n\nIn May 2022, Major League Cricket announced it had acquired funds of US$120 million as part of its Series A and A1 fundraising rounds.[22] Investors committing to MLC featured the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Ross Perot Jr., Anand Rajaraman, Shantanu Narayen and more.[23] MLC plans to use these funds to mainly build stadiums and first-class facilities in the hopes of accelerating cricket's development across the United States.[24][25]\n\nIn June 2022, MLC announced the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket Youth (MiLC Youth).[26] The inaugural season of MiLC Youth was announced to be contested between eleven teams at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in Houston starting July 25, 2022.[27] The finals for the inaugural season took place on July 29 at between the Dallas Mustangs and the New Jersey Stallions,[28] in which the Stallions beat the Mustangs by two wickets.[29]\n\nIn November 2022, it was announced the first season of MLC will be staged from July 13–30, 2023, at Grand Prairie Stadium. The tournament will be played in a single round-robin format with 15 league matches played among six franchises before a four-match play-off phase. MLC also hopes to play matches in a to-be-constructed stadium in Los Angeles, and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.[30]\n\nIn February 2023, it was announced that the player draft for the league's inaugural season would be held on March 19, 2023.[31]\n\nThe inaugural player draft was held on March 19, 2023, at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston.[32] The draft was conducted over 9 rounds via a serpentine system, where the team order is reversed every round.[33] Out of the 9 rounds, 8 were general draft picks, with the final round being exclusively for U-23 players.[34] Each of the six teams had a purse of over $1 million, with $800,000 for overseas players and $300,000 for US-based players.[35] The draft had a fixed salary cap with a maximum of $75,000 (first round) and a minimum of $2,500 (ninth round).[36] Overseas signings were directly signed and were not part of the draft.[37] Each franchise must have a minimum of fifteen players, with the maximum being eighteen. Out of these eighteen players, a maximum of nine can be overseas players.[38]\n\nFollowing the draft, it was reported that USAC had not yet sanctioned either Major or Minor League Cricket for the 2023 season, with the ICC stating that its members should not issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to release players to participate at this time. Interim chairman of the board Atul Rai citing unspecified concerns and outstanding issues over how ACE is administering the competitions, including wanting to seek a more \"favorable\" short-term agreement. MLC director Justin Geale stated that the sanctioning applications were with USA Cricket\", and that \"the recent staffing changes at USA Cricket may have contributed to any delays.[39] In April 2023, the league was officially sanctioned by the ICC, removing a significant obstacle to the league launching in July.[40] Play began on July 13, 2023.[41]\n\n2024 season[edit]\n\nIn December 2023, it was announced that the second season of the tournament would begin on July 4, 2024, just four days after the conclusion of the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.[42] It was also reported that the matches would be played in Grand Prairie Stadium along with other venues.[43]\n\nIn February 2024, the lists of retained domestic and overseas players were released ahead of the domestic player draft.[44][45] In March, Cognizant was named as the title sponsor for the league from the 2024 season.[46]\n\nTeams[edit]\n\nMLC began with six teams and uses a single-entity structure under which all teams are owned by ACE, with investor-operators (who have invested in the company) assigned to each team.[47] It hopes to expand to ten teams in the future.[48]\n\nUSA Cricket's CEO Iain Higgins identified Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York, and San Francisco as markets where the sport was most popular.[19] The league's six inaugural teams are assigned to Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.[49] Only Dallas currently has a home stadium; the league plans to build cricket stadiums in the other locales.\n\nList of current teams[edit]\n\nMajor League Cricket teams Team City Stadium Capacity Founded Captain Coach Owners Los Angeles Knight Riders[50] Irvine, California Great Park Cricket Stadium (planned)[51] 10,000 (planned) 2023 Sunil Narine Phil Simmons Knight Riders Group[52] MI New York[53] Brooklyn, New York City, New York Marine Park Cricket Stadium (planned)[54] 10,000 (planned) 2023 Kieron Pollard[55] Robin Peterson[55] Indiawin Sports[56] San Francisco Unicorns[57] San Jose, California Santa Clara County Fairgrounds Stadium (planned)[58] 15,000 (planned) 2023 Aaron Finch[59] Shane Watson Anand Rajaraman[60]\n\nVenky Harinarayan[61] Seattle Orcas[62] Redmond, Washington Marymoor Cricket Community Park (planned)[63] 6,000 (planned) 2023 Wayne Parnell Pravin Amre GMR Group[64]\n\nS.

The renovated venues have a budget of approximately $3 million each, while the three new west coast venues have a budget of $30 million each; ACE stated that the west coast venues would be completed by 2024, and will have a projected capacity of 10,000–20,000.[77][78] As of November 2022, it was reported that work on the other proposed pitches had not yet commenced.[30]\n\nIn February 2023, it was reported that most of the 2023 matches were set to be played in Grand Prairie, with Church Street Park set to be used as a secondary venue.[30][79] Due to the summer heat in Texas, it was reported by ESPNcricinfo that most matches would be scheduled as night games, rather than scheduled in the daytime hours to attract audiences in markets such as India.[30] With the announcement of the 2023 schedule, it was confirmed that a portion of the group stage will be played at Church Street Park; due to a curfew on the use of floodlights, these matches will begin in the early evening.[80]\n\nBroadcasters[edit]\n\nIn the United States, MLC games are broadcast by Willow, with selected matches also being carried by CBS Sports Network, and over-the-top television service Sling TV also streaming matches as part of a sponsorship agreement.[81]\n\nInternational providers include TNT Sports (formerly BT Sport) in the United Kingdom, Sports18 in India, Fox Cricket in Australia, and Sky Sport in New Zealand.[82]\n\nMinor League Cricket[edit]\n\nMain article: Minor League Cricket\n\nMinor League Cricket is a developmental league for Major League Cricket that completed its inaugural season in 2021.[16] It consists of 26 franchise-based teams in four regional divisions.[83] Unlike Major League Cricket, Minor League Cricket uses privately owned franchises.[47]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]",

    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) finally got underway in the United States last week after several false starts, fuelling hopes that the sport is poised to break new ground in a huge new market on the back of the popular Twenty20 format.\n\nFive years after USA Cricket shared its plans to launch a domestic T20 tournament, the inaugural edition of the MLC kicked off having assembled an impressive array of investors. Four of its six franchises are owned by business entities which also own teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the money-spinning standard bearer of franchise cricket.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is co-owner of the MLC's Seattle franchise, while Washington and San Francisco franchises have strategic partnerships with the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria. While franchise-based competitions are springing up all around the world, Tom Dunmore, MLC's marketing vice president, said the U.S. competition cannot be dismissed as \"just another T20 league\".\n\n\"We're building stadiums and youth academies, we're building training centres and bringing in coaches and players,\" he told Reuters from Dallas. \"Those will be available for the USA national teams as well.\n\n\"It's not really like other T20 leagues that are using existing facilities in cricket-mad countries.\" While cricket remains a niche sport in the U.S. it has been around for a long time in the country - the first international cricket match took place in New York in 1844 with the United States taking on Canada.\n\nThe MLC could be cricket's vehicle to break into a sporting landscape dominated by baseball, basketball and American football, said Dunmore. \"We're cracking a new market for the sport,\" he added.\n\n\"Cricket hasn't really broken into a major new market for some time. So this is a chance not only to do that, but to do it in the world's biggest commercial market.\" Dunmore said cricket's existing fan base in the U.S. made it the sport's fifth-largest market.\n\n\"If we slice off even a small percentage of the rest of the population, you've got a massive market.\" West Indies' Kieron Pollard, one of the first players to fully embrace franchise cricket, was confident MLC would take cricket \"prime-time\" in the U.S., even though others had failed to break open the market.\n\n\"Obviously before MLC, different people have tried different things,\" the 36-year-old, who leads the league's New York franchise, told Reuters. \"But now the difference is the backing of the Indian franchises and the international players that are coming.\"\n\n'THE BUZZ' Success on the global stage would help boost cricket's profile in the United States, and while there has been no big breakthrough as yet Pollard said they are getting closer.\n\nA U.S. team featuring players mostly of Indian origin made it to the 50-overs World Cup qualifiers in June but failed to make the cut for the main tournament in India later this year. But the experience of rubbing shoulders with the likes of former South Africa captain Faf du Plessis and England international Jason Roy would stand them in good stead, Pollard said.\n\n\"It augurs well for USA cricket, and hopefully the young talent that is there in America can use this opportunity to grow into better international cricketers,\" he added. Co-hosting the T20 World Cup next year with West Indies will also give the game a boost in the United States.\n\nThe launch of the MLC assumes even more importance coming at a time when the International Cricket Council (ICC) is lobbying for the game's Olympic inclusion at the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Dunmore said the MLC was providing cricket much-needed visibility as the game bids to return to the Olympics for the first time since 1900.\n\n\"The crowds and the excitement, the buzz, the media attention both in the US and globally, now that's truly helpful,\" he added. ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice acknowledged the buzz MLC has created in the United States.\n\n\"There are a number of developments in the U.S. that are helping to raise awareness of the game, the start of the MLC is one of them, they draw a lot of attention to the sport,\" Allardice said last week.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

The ground is the home base for the Major League Cricket Academy Seattle, serving more than 200 youth cricketers playing in the Seattle Youth Cricket League.\n\nStarting in the 2022 season, the Center will also be the home of the Seattle Thunderbolts. The Thunderbolts begin play this summer in the Toyota Minor League Cricket Championship presented by SLING TV, a national Twenty20 cricket competition for 27 city-based teams from across the United States.\n\nThe center features two grounds for both adult and youth play. Three turf wickets are located on each ground, allowing for season-long play.

    "body": "Graham Manou certainly didn't think in cricket he'd ever find himself at NASA.\n\nYet the one-Test wicketkeeper, now Cricket Victoria high performance manager, was there at the Space Centre in Houston calling the shots prior to launch in March.\n\nIt was draft night in Texas for Major League Cricket's inaugural season – the United States' foray into T20 franchise cricket – and some of Australian cricket's most influential figures were right in the thick of it.\n\nA few days earlier, MLC tournament director Justin Geale – who was born in Canberra and grew up in Wagga Wagga, and later spent eight years in cricket operations at the Indian Premier League – was sat next to Manou, CV chief executive Nick Cummins, Victorian assistant coach Ben Rohrer and Cricket NSW Head of Male Cricket Michael Klinger watching America's best domestic talent at a 13-day draft combine.\n\nAmong them was Victorian and Melbourne Stars fast bowler Brody Couch, one of four 'Australian-American' prospects up for grabs in the draft.\n\n\"It was quite surreal,\" Geale recalls, \"we're sitting in Houston in the middle of nowhere at these six turf cricket fields just thinking 'we could be anywhere in the world, but we're all together, Australians here in Houston'.\n\n\"It's been a learning curve for them as well, a steep one when you come from somewhere like the Big Bash, which is now well established, really well run, well organised, promoted and defined, to something a bit new and unknown like this.\"\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nAfter South Africa (SA20) and the United Arab Emirates (International League T20), the US is set to become the third nation to launch a new domestic T20 league in 2023.\n\nGeale agrees \"there is too much cricket at the moment\", but he also believes the US has a significant advantage.\n\n\"We've got that clear window,\" he tells cricket.com.au from his home just outside of Chicago.\n\nImage Id: 01533D4F31544FCC8804590E0FF6E69A Image Caption: Geale (right) presents former England bowler Liam Plunkett his San Francisco cap on draft night // Supplied-MLC\n\n\"Around that Christmas time this year you had Big Bash, then there was the SA20, there was the UAE T20 going on, Nepal, Bangladesh, all these ones at the same times competing with the same players.\n\n\"Our summer here, we can play cricket a lot of the year round depending where in the country you are … down in Florida or LA you've got a longer season.\n\n\"Fundamentally, our summer is the opposite to a southern hemisphere summer so really it's the UK that we're going alongside.\n\n\"That window helps, we can generally get some of the best players in the world for two or three weeks to come over and play some really good cricket.\"\n\nStarting on July 13, the six MLC teams will play 19 games in 18 days mostly at Grand Prairie Stadium – a former baseball park that's been converted into the league's new 7200-seat purpose-built home near Dallas.\n\nIt's already attracting plenty of global superstars too, including Aaron Finch and Marcus Stoinis (San Francisco Unicorns), Mitch Marsh and Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas), and Anrich Nortje and Wanindu Hasaranga (Washington Freedom).\n\n\"As a kid growing up, we're pretty heavily influenced by American sport and culture, so I think there's a degree of curiosity about cricket in this market and the players are no different to us,\" Geale says.\n\n\"They're quite keen to come and see and do something new.\"\n\nAnother advantage according to Geale is the scale of commercial opportunity with sponsors and broadcasting in the US sports market.\n\nAnd while there have been previous attempts to establish a cricket competition in the USA – such as Pro Cricket in 2004 – this iteration has the backing of more than a dozen of America's most successful business leaders, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe chairman and CEO Shantanu Narayen.\n\nThree IPL franchises have also bought in – Los Angeles Knight Riders (Kolkata), MI New York (Mumbai Indians) and Texas Super Kings (Chennai), while GMR Group, the co-owner of the Delhi Capitals, have partnered with the Seattle Orcas.\n\n\"The level of investment we have, being privately funded out of Silicon Valley, you've got some pretty high-net-worth individuals … that are personally invested in this,\" Geale says.\n\n\"We'll be able to drive a really competitive salary cap and we're there from day one.\"\n\nWhy are Victoria and NSW involved?\n\nUnlike the four IPL teams who have extensive experience running a cricket program, the lead investors of the San Francisco and Washington franchises don't.\n\nImage Id: ECF6B3617AD24A7089E48C50568690F3 Image Caption: The six Major League Cricket teams for 2023 // Supplied-MLC\n\nUnicorns pair Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan are the founding partners at Milliways Ventures and Rocketship.vc, while Freedom's lead investor Sanjay Govil is the founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions and CEO of Zyter.\n\nBoth franchises were therefore looking to partner with an existing professional organisation to run their respective cricket departments and help with the recruitment of players and coaches, establish training, sports science and sports medicine programs, and facilitate match day operations.\n\nThat's where Cricket Victoria and Cricket NSW come in – with more than 130 years of delivering cricket in their respective states, they are San Francisco and Washington's high performance partners.\n\nIt's how Manou and Klinger found themselves at NASA on March 19 trying to build a roster for their respective teams having only laid eyes on most of the domestic talent over the preceding two weeks at the draft combine.\n\n\"The interesting part for us was that you felt at times perhaps we're going in very blind here,\" Manou tells cricket.com.au after returning to Melbourne. \"But heading across and seeing them play and being around the combine was certainly worth us going and doing that.\n\n\"We felt quite lucky in the way we thought the draft would play out in terms of what players would and wouldn't be available at different times was right, which probably suggests there was some clear bands in terms of the talent.\"\n\nKlinger adds: \"We did a lot of research before heading over with our analysts … (but) the four days of two matches each day (at the combine) definitely opened our eyes a little bit more.\"\n\nImage Id: 15DCB774C62E476CA4AE3D2B7A5C7EBF Image Caption: Klinger (front right) with the Washington Freedom franchise at the draft on March 19 // Supplied-MLC\n\nWhat's in it for the two states?\n\nIt's a fair question – how does partnering with a US-based franchise help with the success of NSW in the Marsh Sheffield Shield or the two Sydney clubs in the KFC BBL?\n\nBeyond the obvious links it establishes for players to be picked up by their state's MLC club, Geale believes most sporting organisations in Australia realise that a lot of the growth opportunities are offshore.\n\n\"It's another way for them to expand their footprint in a global cricket world, which is changing rapidly all the time,\" he says.\n\nAlong with establishing links for players, there will also be opportunities for coaches, physiotherapists, team operations staff and analysts from Victoria and NSW to get experience in a new environment.\n\n\"The cricket landscape is changing very quickly so to be directly involved in the way cricket's moving and part of the landscape that's T20 franchise cricket … it was obviously a very attractive tournament to be involved in,\" Klinger says.\n\nBut both states also understand their first obligation is ensuring their Australian players and squads are being serviced well.\n\n\"In the first year, we'll make it a relatively skeleton staff,\" Manou says.\n\n\"We've got some high-quality senior players in (former England fast bowler) Liam Plunkett and Corey Anderson (ex-New Zealand) who will no doubt play more than just playing role, both are equally as good as any leader that I've come across and have both shown a lot of interest in developing as coaches and getting involved in off field management as well.\"\n\nFor Geale and the sport in the US, the partnership goes beyond just Major League Cricket (which received official sanctioning from the governing body, USA Cricket, last month).\n\n\"Importantly, it opens up opportunities … I really think some of our younger players could benefit from six or eight weeks or a season in grade cricket, that's really going to elevate their cricket being around better cricketers,\" he says.\n\n\"That's one of the appeals for us with the Australian market and the season works nicely for that.\n\n\"The same as coaching staff, the same if you look beyond that at curators, at event operations staff, so that summer works nicely, a lot of six or seven-month jobs there, they can come over here for a few months.\"\n\nKlinger revealed NSW would also explore having a coach based in Washington or the US to work with their players weekly, while Manou says the Australian pathway system would also benefit from the relationship with potential opportunities for Premier cricketers to play in minor league teams.\n\nImage Id: AC4B2FE5F1EF43B3936CC8AE373452A5 Image Caption: Former Black Caps allrounder Anderson bowls at the draft combine // Supplied-MLC\n\n\"It might be playing a Premier Cricket season, it might be getting involved with one of our two BBL teams and training with them for a few weeks and being part of a really good set-up with two very experienced coaches in Greg Shipperd (Sydney Sixers) and Trevor Bayliss (Sydney Thunder), we're certainly looking at ways we can help those individuals become better cricketers, but also help cricket in America overall,\" Klinger says.\n\nThere are 'Australian-American' players?\n\nCameron Stevenson says he's never been one to get \"super nervous\" but as he sat in his office in Melbourne about midday on Monday, March 20 watching Geale announce each pick, he couldn't look and had to step away from his computer.\n\nHalf a world away at NASA, the United States' best players were up for grabs and Stevenson – by virtue of his mum's heritage – was one of the top prospects.\n\nAn engineer by day whose firm SPORTENG has been helping the MLC develop their new Grand Prairie Stadium, the 30-year-old says being part of the inaugural draft had the \"heart pounding\".\n\n\"I was too nervous to look once we started getting into the later rounds that I might not go, and I actually stepped away from my computer,\" Stevenson, who was part of Tasmania's list until 2018, recalls to cricket.com.au.\n\nImage Id: 0DB80F62F77C4E4788FD041326EB33A5 Image Caption: Stevenson celebrates a wicket on T20I debut for the USA last year // Twitter-@ZimCricketv\n\nBrody Couch – whose mum was also born in the US – was another watching along on YouTube from back home in Victoria, having just returned from the draft combine in Texas.\n\nFinally, in the sixth round, Geale read out Stevenson's name – pick 31 to the Texas Super Kings – and two picks later the Australian-American tournament director was back at the lectern announcing Couch's selection by the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nThe most experienced Aussie 'local' Cameron Gannon – who like the other two qualifies as a US domestic player due to his mum – had been picked up two rounds earlier by the Seattle Orcas, where he has been joined current West Australian teammate Mitch Marsh as an overseas recruit, though Marsh's availability for the tournament is now under threat due to his inclusion in Australia's Ashes squad.\n\nFormer Victorian and current Hampshire allrounder Ian Holland – who was born in the midwestern US state of Wisconsin – was the other 'Australian-American' in the draft pool, but he missed out on selection.\n\n\"It was a bit of relief in the end just to know that I'm going to be part of it all in the inaugural season,\" Couch says.\n\n\"I was definitely nervous at the time because I was hoping to go a bit sooner than I did but, when I heard my named called, I was just relieved.\"\n\nCouch – whose mum grew up on a dairy farm at Albany in upstate New York where her family still reside – had been at the combine from March 4-16, which he says helped him determine where he thought his ability was compared to the other local players.\n\nImage Id: 4C44CA85EB20414FAD9FC7DCA088C0F3 Image Caption: Couch in action for the Melbourne Stars in BBL|12 // Getty\n\n\"It was all completely new,\" the 23-year-old recalls, \"I had a roommate (Matthew Tromp, pick 49 to Seattle Orcas) who I'd never met before.\n\n\"It was a lot less structured and there was a big onus on myself just to put in what I wanted to get out of having that time over there.\n\n\"It was quite refreshing for me actually … being one of the very few Aussies over there at the time that I went, I put myself out of my comfort zone a little bit and built some connections with people who I probably never thought I would.\n\n\"The guys were really welcoming and just love their cricket … so it was no different to back here in that sense.\"\n\nWhat's the depth of American talent like?\n\n\"There's a lot more cricket in the US already than people realise,\" says Stevenson, who has played 18 ODIs and four T20Is for the USA owing to his mum being born Arizona and raised in California.\n\n\"There's definitely room for cricket over there and enough interest to build cricket in the US into something that's a little bit more mainstream than what it is now.\n\nImage Id: B2C662A17A5046E0A32BA096DBC8257A Image Caption: Stevenson is presented his T20I cap by South African-born USA fast bowler Rusty Theron // Twitter-@usacricket\n\n\"These guys are as good as I've seen in terms of raw talent. The ability that they've got is up there with any state cricketer that I've seen here.\n\n\"It's a really difficult environment to flourish as a cricketer because of the lack of first-class facilities and the level of competition historically hasn't been there to help these guys hone their game at a really high level.\"\n\nBoth Manou and Klinger admit they were \"pleasantly surprised\" at the skills on display from the local US players at the draft combine.\n\nThe fact that Gannon was drafted in the fourth round, and Couch and Stevenson – all who have played first-class cricket and in the Big Bash, with Stevenson also featuring for the US national team as recently as last September – were taken in the sixth round, attests to this.\n\nOnly eight of the 48 non-rookie players drafted to MLC teams haven't played first-class cricket and not even being a reigning ODI World Cup champion was enough to get Plunkett picked in the first round.\n\nAnd former New Zealand allrounder Anderson, former Indian under-19 captain Unmukt Chand, Plunkett, No.1 MLC draft pick Harmeet Singh and former Punjab leg-spinner Sarabjit Ladda all have IPL experience.\n\n\"The depth of talent is there, there's no doubt about that,\" Klinger says.\n\n\"There's a lot of ex-players from the subcontinent who've played international cricket or been part of IPL franchises or PSL (Pakistan Super League) franchises. There were players who had been in first-class systems in the subcontinent, first-class systems in South Africa, who left for different reasons.\n\n\"So there was definitely a positive feel about the quality that was there and that they'd be able to match it against some of our high quality overseas players as well.\"\n\nManou adds: \"There was certainly a band of players that could play and have played first-class cricket and there was quite a significant band of players that would easily fit into Premier first-grade across (Australia).\n\n\"It is and has been a bit of a sleeping giant there for a while. And hopefully this is the catalyst to make it grow.\"\n\nWith at least five players in each team's starting XI required to be domestic players, which is more than the two required in fellow associate nation the UAE's ILT20 tournament, that depth will be needed to ensure the quality of the product in its first season remains high.\n\nWith a maximum of six overseas recruits allowed in the XI and nine in the squad, along with 10 domestic players on the roster, each franchise was also required to pick a rookie from the under-23 age group in the ninth round of the draft.\n\n\"When I first got to America, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good the cricket was here, there's literally thousands of leagues played across the country,\" Geale says.\n\nImage Id: 4BF1E97364EF4FB1A7717ACA0620BEED Image Caption: New Zealand great and Chennai IPL coach Stephen Fleming will also coach the Texas Super Kings // Supplied-MLC\n\n\"What I was probably most disappointed or shocked at was the infrastructure and where we play. A lot of it is soccer fields, baseball diamonds, which aren't perfect, it's guys diving around with no faith in the outfield or councils that couldn't cut the grass any lower because baseball is 'this' height.\n\n\"It's taken three years to try and build a domestic program working with USA Cricket, working with the local leagues to try and build a pathway to the national team and to really give our domestic players the best chance.\n\n\"So when the major league comes around, it's got to be about the cricket, the cricket has got to be a good product.\n\n\"We can bring 'Finchy' and all the boys across but if the domestic players aren't up for it, it won't work. We're really confident that we've spent these three years building up our domestic programs, so the strength of the game from day one is going to be really good.\"",

So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nGermon claimed the United States was the “No.1 development market” for the International Cricket Council.\n\n“We’re all aware of the size of market in the United States, the size of the South Asian diaspora, and the fact that the T20 World Cup will be there [during 2024 in partnership with the West Indies].

    "title": "Proteas batter Heinrich Klaasen drives Major League Cricket into a spin",
    "date": "Sun Jul 16 07:40:12 2023",
    "body": "There has been a long-standing conviction that South African batters struggle to play spin.\n\nBut Proteas middle-order star Heinrich Klaasen is certainly doing his very best to eradicate that perception. The 31-year-old showed in the Betway SA20 that he was ready to take on the spinners, but his reputation was certainly enhanced with a breakout season in the Indian Premier League (IPL) where he was hailed as arguably the best player of spin in the tournament.\n\nThis was supported by the fact that no IPL batter had a strike-rate of 191.3, and average of 132 against spin, that Klaasen boasted.\n\nConsidering Klaasen was a foreigner, performing on the subcontinent against the very best the spin game had to offer, was even more impressive.\n\nAnd now Klaasen has transferred that success against the slower bowlers to the inaugural Major League Cricket season where he struck 53 off just 31 balls (4x4, 3x6) to drive the Seattle Orcas to a 35-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nIt was another top-quality display against spin bowling with Klaasen creating the momentum in his innings when he came up against Pakistan wizard Shadab Khab.\n\nHaving initially been kept quiet by the Unicorns pacemen Liam Plumkett and Haris Rauf, Klaasen tore into Shadab by striking the leg-spinner for 19 runs off just eight balls, which included two sixes and a boundary.\n\n“My (plan) is to get one hit away and then get going. Try to be very aggressive against the spinners too. If the ball does not turn a lot, and it is in your half, try to hit away. Some spinners you fancy a little more, and I try to pick my spinners (to hit),” Klassen said.\n\nProteas white-ball coach Rob Walter will certainly be keeping a close eye on Klaasen and the rest of his charges currently in the United States with the incoming Australian tour on the horizon.\n\nAnd then, of course, there’s the small matter of the World Cup that is set to take place in India from October where Klaasen’s ability to score freely against spin, especially in the middle overs, will be central to the Proteas’ chances.\n\nKlaasen, therefore, is continuing to work hard on the basics in order that this red-hot streak doesn’t desert him at a critical juncture.\n\n“I have fallen into the trap of taking the game for granted,”he said. “So just waking up every day and starting on zero. Just start over again. This game humbles you very quickly and hopefully this form continues.”\n\nThe MLC opening weekend also saw fellow Proteas middle-order batter David Miller club 61 off 42 balls for the Texas Super Kings, while youngster Dewald Brevis struck a breezy 32 off 25 balls for MI New York (MINY).\n\nOn the bowling front, young tearaway Gerald Coetzee snared 2/22 for TSK and Kagiso Rabada showed a semblance of returning to form with 2/32 for MINY.\n\nAnrich Nortje and Marco Jansen also bagged 1/29 and 1/30 respectively for the Washington Freedom.",

I feel like game is easy because you just got to go there and execute, right, because your muscle memory is there,” Malhodra said. “But in practice, you're trying different things, which makes it a little more harder. But that's when you prepare for a real game.”\n\nStanding by are a staff of coaches and a medical team to ensure proper hydration and recovery as North Texas sizzles under the heat dome.\n\n\"All these guys have gotten used to playing in these type of temperature and which is an advantage,\" Sagar Manoharan said. Manoharan is the strength and conditioning coach for the LA Knight Riders. \"Abu Dhabi and also India in the season happens during summer, peak summer.

    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) has arrived in the United States, marking the beginning of a new era for cricket enthusiasts. With influential owners from the renowned Indian Premier League (IPL) investing in franchises, the inaugural season of MLC promises to be an electrifying spectacle. This exciting development has captured the attention of fans and players worldwide, as it presents a unique opportunity to witness the fusion of international talent and American cricketing infrastructure.\n\nThe league brings together a stellar cast of players, blending established stars with emerging talents from cricketing nations. The inaugural season is poised to showcase the highest level of cricketing skill and entertainment as teams battle it out to claim the coveted MLC title. Among the myriad of talented individuals set to grace the field, there are seven players who stand out as ones to watch closely.\n\nAs fans eagerly anticipate the debut season of MLC, these players are expected to set the stage ablaze with their captivating performances, creating a lasting impression on American cricketing history. In addition to their captivating performances, these seven players are expected to leave their mark in history with their outrageous stunts, goofy antics, and epic pranks!\n\nIn this article, we highlight seven players who are set to make a significant impact in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket.\n\n1) Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings)\n\nFaf du Plessis, the former South African captain, brings immense experience and leadership to the Texas Super Kings. Known for his impeccable technique and calm demeanor, du Plessis is a reliable top-order batsman capable of anchoring the innings. His ability to construct innings and score big runs will be invaluable to his team’s success. Not to forget his recent form with the bat for the Royal Challengers finishing 2nd on the list, and an impeccable career in T20.\n\n2) Rashid Khan (MI New York)\n\nThe Afghan spin sensation Rashid Khan has consistently performed in various T20 leagues worldwide. His deceptive leg spin and remarkable control over line and length make him a lethal weapon in any bowling attack. Rashid’s ability to take wickets regularly and restrict the opposition’s scoring rate will be pivotal in MI New York’s quest for glory. Having finished 2nd on the purple cap list and continuing to maintain his mystery, Rashid would be unplayable.\n\n3) Sunil Narine (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nSunil Narine, the crafty West Indian all-rounder, is renowned for his unconventional but effective bowling style. His variations, particularly the mystery spin, have troubled many batters. Narine’s ability to stifle the flow of runs in the middle overs and contribute crucial runs with the bat makes him an integral part of the Los Angeles Knight Riders’ setup. Sunil will be rearing to undo his below-par IPL season.\n\n4) Andre Russell (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nAndre Russell, the explosive Jamaican all-rounder, is a force to be reckoned with in the T20 format. His powerful hitting and ability to clear boundaries will make him a nightmare for any bowling attack. Russell’s dynamic presence in the middle order and his knack for delivering impactful performances with both bat and ball will be vital for the Los Angeles Knight Riders. Although he is on the back of a bad year in IPL 2023, Dre Russ has had a phenomenal T20 career, and the grounds in the USA would be too small for him.\n\n5) Devon Conway (Texas Super Kings)\n\nThe talented New Zealand batsman, Devon Conway, has been making waves in international cricket with his consistent run-scoring ability. His elegant stroke play, combined with a solid technique, allows him to adapt to different situations. Conway’s ability to build innings and accelerate when needed will be crucial for the success of the Texas Super Kings. Devon was instrumental in CSK’s 5th IPL title scoring vital runs and clinching the player of the match in the finals.\n\n6) Tim David (MI New York)\n\nTim David, the Singaporean-born Australian cricketer, has impressed with his explosive batting displays in various T20 leagues. His aggressive approach, coupled with an extensive range of shots, makes him a dangerous middle-order batsman. David’s ability to provide quick runs in the death overs and his athleticism in the field will be invaluable for MI New York. His exploits in the recently concluded season of IPL 2023 will be a massive boost for the team.\n\n7) Kagiso Rabada (MI New York)\n\nKagiso Rabada, the South African pace sensation, is known for his express pace and ability to generate bounce. With his ability to swing the ball both ways and deliver lethal yorkers, Rabada is a nightmare for batters in the death overs. His wicket-taking prowess and ability to contain runs under pressure will make him a key player for MI New York.\n\nAs Major League Cricket prepares to embark on its inaugural season, the league boasts an impressive array of talent from across the globe. The presence of experienced campaigners like Faf du Plessis, Rashid Khan, Sunil Narine, and Andre Russell, along with emerging stars like Devon Conway, Tim David, and Kagiso Rabada, is set to provide thrilling cricketing action for fans. These seven players, with their unique skills and match-winning abilities, are bound to significantly impact the inaugural season of Major League Cricket. But let’s not forget. They’ll also provide us with plenty of entertainment off the field. They’ll surely bring us some hilarious pranks, wacky outfits, and maybe even a few epic dance moves!",

    "body": "Major League Cricket has arrived in Dallas, and it rules. The atmosphere is electric, the players are world-class, the stadium is comfortable, and the game itself—well, it’s fast-paced, and I’m starting to understand it. As a food writer, of course, I was attracted to another aspect of the experience: the concession stands, which sell South Asian food and drinks.\n\nThe playoffs are coming up this week, in four games: day and night games this Thursday, a Friday night matchup, and a Sunday night championship. Here’s what to eat and drink when you go.\n\nAll the concessions at Grand Prairie Stadium are operated by a local mini-chain called Foodistaan. Foodistaan’s first location opened in Irving in early 2022; now it’s got a second location in Southlake and plans to debut soon in Frisco and Cedar Park (outside Austin). Four restaurants and a whole darn stadium is an ambitious expansion in less than a year and a half. But, based on our stadium experience, Foodistaan is handling it pretty well.\n\nThe menu includes South Asian appetizers—samosas, chili garlic fries, and bagged snacks—along with American ballpark staples like nachos and popcorn. Chicken and veggie burgers are available (not beef), and chicken wings, too.\n\nWe thought the wings were ordinary, but the potato and pea samosas were stars. Ballpark samosas have no right to be this good: full of flavor and seasoning, with fresher pastry than some I’ve had in actual restaurants. One guy in front of us in line carried away a paper boat of six samosas.\n\nWhen we picked up our samosa order, the man at the counter pointed and told me, “The ketchup’s over there.” So I dutifully dunked a bit of samosa in ketchup. I’d never done it before, but it turns out that if you start with a spicy enough samosa, it’s not bad with ketchup. (The stadium also stocks packets of mustard, relish, mayo, and tamarind chutney.)\n\nThe big-ticket items, at $20, are takeout trays of biryani, the dish of long-grained rice, spices, and (here) your choice of veggies or boneless chicken. We passed our chicken biryani back and forth—it’s big enough for a group of four—and let the rolling heat pass over our tongues.\n\nBeers are $8—except for Arka, an Indian-style lager with rice added, which is $7. It’s light, malty, and easy to drink. There’s not a lot of information about Arka online, but based on the bottle label and some information I dug up online, it appears to be contract-brewed at the Abita Brewing Company facilities in Louisiana. It comes in glass bottles, which stadium staff pour out into red plastic cups.\n\nAt the concession stall behind our section, a lot of items were already sold out or unavailable. I was ready to take down some chili garlic fries. Maybe next time. In theory, all of Foodistaan’s stalls carry the same menu. Make no mistake: we’ll be back, and we’ll go hungry. Major League Cricket is serving up a good experience—and that includes the stadium food.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium, 1600 Lone Star Pkwy., Grand Prairie.",
    "summary": "* The tournament is taking place at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, with an electric atmosphere and world-class players.\n* The playoffs are scheduled for this week, with four games: two day and night games on Thursday, a Friday night matchup, and a Sunday night championship.\n* The stadium concessions, operated by Foodistaan, offer a variety of South Asian food and drinks, including samosas, chili garlic fries, burgers, wings, and biryani trays.\n* The article highly recommends the samosas and biryani, and also mentions the availability of beers, including an Indian-style lager called Arka.\n* The stadium experience is considered excellent, with comfortable seating and a lively atmosphere.",

    "body": "March 19 is set to be a landmark date for cricket in the United States as the Visitor Center of NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston will host the player draft for the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) Twenty20 tournament that is scheduled to launch in July this year.\n\nMLC will become the latest T20 league to surface across the globe, just months after South Africa and the United Arab Emirates introduced their versions to the cricketing world and almost 15 years after the Indian Premier League (IPL) changed cricket forever.\n\nAl Jazeera spoke to Justin Geale, MLC tournament director, about the aims of the league, cricket in the US and if the sport really needs another tournament.\n\nAl Jazeera: Does cricket really need one more tournament?\n\nJustin Geale: There’s too much cricket, everyone will agree to that. It’s a very full calendar. But I think we have a couple of unique things in here. One is our window and timing. We sit very nicely in July.\n\nWhat cricket needs now is new markets. If we’re going to sustain all this cricket, we need to reach new markets, new sponsors, and I think America really is the only realistic potential for it right now.\n\nIt’s such a big country and a very sophisticated sports market that is keen to take new things. In terms of growth, USA Cricket recognised this. We’re also hosting 20 matches next year as part of the jointly hosted World Cup with the West Indies. The projection for the game is strong here. If you look at LA 2028 Olympics, hopefully, we can get cricket included.\n\nThere’s also definitely a curiosity, no question about that. Which is why we aim to be here for the long term.\n\nAl Jazeera: From short stopovers to a major league, how far has cricket come along in the US?\n\nGeale: It’s been tough. The biggest challenge in this country is infrastructure, it’s finding the right spots to play the game. I come from Australia and I’ve worked in the IPL. When I got here three years ago, I was surprised at how good the domestic talent was. I was probably a bit shocked by where they were playing – lot of it was uneven outfields, football fields, synthetic surfaces, matting, etc. We needed better facilities, that’s been our biggest challenge and will continue to be.\n\nBut that’s improving and with that comes the ability to host the high-profile matches. In terms of a fanbase, there’s already an expat or first- and second-generation Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Afghans here. Throw in Australians, South Africans and the English and on the other coast the West Indies population, there’s enough knowledge and following of the game which is comforting for us.\n\nI guess the bigger hook and aim is to bring new people to the sport, to convert the Americans to cricket.\n\nAl Jazeera: Is that one of the major aims of MLC? What about revenue and the spotlight?\n\nGeale: It has to be all things, to be honest.\n\nIf it doesn’t generate revenue, it’s not going to be sustainable. The opportunity here is huge. We’re talking about the second-biggest sport in the world in the largest sporting media market in the world. If we get the product right, I’m sure the growth and revenue will come through commercial opportunities not just here in the US but also through broadcast in India where cricket revenue really is coming from.\n\nBut as a league, first we need to show we can play good cricket. If we put a good product out there – good stadiums, good players, good wickets, good umpires – it will show we’re serious about cricket and we build it out from there.\n\nWe can really get to people here who understand the game and then really try and expose it to new audiences. The American sports consumer is such a sophisticated one. It will be unrealistic to think we’re going to have full stadiums from day one and new audiences will come in because they heard about cricket. We need to tap into the existing fanbase. Also, we’ve been developing the domestic players here for three years so they are ready for this.\n\nIf we get the actual product right, the rest is going to follow pretty quick.\n\nAl Jazeera: How is the league looking financially? What are the expenses, pay scales and salary caps like?\n\nGeale: The team owners have been selected for many reasons. They have been told to buy in and that this is going to take time. They also need to commit to funding a stadium in their hometown. That’s a pretty big ask and not done in any other league. So these guys are serious about it. For salary caps, from the get-go, we’re going to be competitive with all leagues – take the IPL out though. We’ll certainly be competitive with the recent leagues like the ILT20 and SA20 and certainly have a bigger cap than something like the CPL.\n\nThe opportunity for players to come to America is an exciting one. While the money is there, it’s a pretty nice idea to come tour America, play cricket, bring your family and your golf clubs too. We haven’t really struggled at all while talking to players. Realistically, we need to manage expectations [with spending] and be sensible in terms of our projections. There’s no point going broke and not having a year two.\n\nAl Jazeera: What has the response from the sponsors been? Have you managed to break into the US market?\n\nGeale: We’ve had a really good conversation with all the usual suspects but also a few American brands. That’s a bit slow because we’re selling a dream, a vision and they are committing to something they are not familiar with. We’re in pretty advanced talks for the MLC but we’re also realistic. It’s probably going to need a bit of a punt as it is a new sport for them.\n\nAl Jazeera: So where does the MLC and cricket in the US go from here?\n\nGeale: As we get more infrastructure, the season’s length grows and we can reach out to more cities. Attracting younger and new people to the game is also something we’re aiming at. For the first time, there’s a career in cricket here. To date, if you’re good at any sport you’re going to go and play something else because there’s a pathway to scholarship and career there.\n\nMLC is an opening point to that as well. It’s in everyone’s interest to make the USA national team. All of a sudden, a lot of international teams will be keen to come on the way to the West Indies or come and do standout tours. Commercially, that opens up a lot more TV money and that money flows back into the players, the domestic structure.\n\nAl Jazeera: What challenges do you see in reaching those goals?\n\nGeale: So we’re not under any illusion to take on the MLB tomorrow. We have the existing cricket fans, they need to rally and get some critical mass. Also, distribution is important. We get some mainstream coverage and that will help with the exposure. We also need to manage expectations, like I said before. It’s tough. But our tournament window does help us, there’s a bit of downtime and hopefully we can attract new audience.\n\nIt’s going to be a hell of a ride but the key is to get year one under way, show the world we can put out a product, get decent crowds in and I think the momentum will quickly build.",

    "body": "Cheers and balls smacking against cricket bats will echo out of Church Street Park until Tuesday for the first-ever Major League Cricket tournament.\n\nMorrisville, a cricket hub, was selected as one of the two towns alongside Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, to host the inaugural season’s matches.\n\nThe excitement can be felt in the home of every cricket fan in the town, especially those who made it happen.\n\nThinking about Morrisville becoming an international hub for the sport gives Jana Chellaperumal “goosebumps.”\n\n“This is a dream come true,” he said. “This is a cricket tournament on a different level that the country has never seen yet.”\n\nChellaperumal is a former president of the Triangle Cricket League, which has about 60 teams and over 3,000 players in the area. The seed to get Major League Cricket and to put Morrisville on the map for the sport was planted about 10 years ago.\n\nThe town first hosted Minor League Cricket games in 2021, giving fans a taste of what would come.\n\n“Hundreds of volunteers worked on the ground,” Chellaperumal said. “So, here we are enjoying the fruit.”\n\nThe economic impact the Major League Cricket games will have on the town is yet to be determined, said Rose Cornelius, president of the town’s Chamber of Commerce. Still, over 3,000 people from around the country are expected to be in Church Street Park, at 5800 Cricket Pitch Way, for the games between six founding national teams.\n\nAfter the games were announced in early June, tickets sold fast, with five of the seven games sold out as of Friday morning.\n\nChurch Street Park was expanded for the games, getting more cricket pitch lanes, LED-lit practice pitches and nets, athlete seating, and safety nets. Food trucks will line the park, and CBS Sports and ESPN+ will stream the games in Morrisville and Texas, broadcasting them to thousands of fans.\n\nAn investment in Morrisville\n\n“We’ve gone from being a park to now a world-class cricket facility in eight years, which is amazing,” Town Councilman Steve Rao said.\n\nUSA Cricket started eyeing Morrisville years ago to make more investments in areas with a large fan base, Rao said. Nearly half (46%) of the residents in Morrisville are of Southeast Asian descent.\n\nBecause of its large fan base, the bat-and-ball game of cricket — involving two teams, a total of 22 players, and a 22-yard field with wickets at each end — has grown in popularity over the years.\n\nSimilar to baseball, one team will bat while the other is on the field during the game. The teams switch during the long inning. The batting team will try to score the runs while the bowling team will try to stop them by fielding the ball.\n\nTeams can score up to 200 points in the match, where the game’s object is to score more runs than your opponent in a certain amount of time. To score a run, players need to hit the ball with the cricket bat.\n\nMost young cricketers have only seen their favorite players on TV or social media, but the games in Morrisville have brought the stars to the town.\n\nTop players include Afghanistan T20 captain Rashid Khan, South African internationals Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and David Miller, West Indians Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, and Dwayne Bravo, and others from England, Australia, Zimbabwe, India and New Zealand.\n\nRussell, a Jamaican cricketer for the Los Angeles Knight Riders, said in an Instagram post he didn’t know “such lovely ground was in North Carolina.”\n\nThe cricket field in Morrisville is one of three International Cricket Council-accredited fields in the country, making it eligible for the T20 Cricket World Cup, a goal for Morrisville leaders.\n\n“We’re hoping that the ICC will choose us,” Mayor TJ Cawley said. “That would have 500 million people watching. We’re hoping that this league will continue to expand and in a couple years, it would be wonderful to have one of our own Major League teams.”\n\nThe town is home to the Minor League Cricket team, the Morrisville Raptors.\n\nHow to see Major League Cricket in Morrisville\n\nTickets for the matches on Monday and Tuesday are still available starting at $12, according to the Major League Cricket website.\n\nFriday night, the Seattle Orcas face off against the Texas Super Kings at 5:30 p.m.\n\nThis story was originally published July 21, 2023, 10:49 AM.",

    "body": "About 7,000 people are expected to pack into a former minor league baseball ballpark near Dallas on Thursday night.\n\n​But the game they’ll see will feature hitters with fat bats swinging at bouncing balls — because the game will be cricket. It’s the first game of a new professional cricket league for the United States.\n\nThe bat-and-ball sport that’s kinda but not really like baseball is hugely popular in a lot of places that used to be part of the British empire.\n\nBut here in the U.S.? Not so much.\n\n​The leaders of the startup Major League Cricket hope to change that. They’ve invested $100 million to set up a six-team league — with rosters that include international stars — that will compete over the next two weeks.\n\nThe league is banking on interest from South Asian communities in the U.S. But the road to turning a profit could be bumpy.\n\nCricket has grown a lot in the U.S. since Ravi Etwaroo started his cricket equipment business in the Bronx, New York, in 2006.\n\n“We have local schools, high schools now taking part in cricket. We have college cricket,” Etwaroo said.\n\nMuch of that growth is an effect of South Asian immigration to the U.S. Cricket has a huge fan base in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Now, Major League Cricket hopes to take the sport pro here — and tap into those growing communities and their enthusiasm, said league spokesperson Tom Dunmore.\n\n“This probably wouldn’t have the same upside if we were doing this in the 1980s or even early ’90s,” Dunmore said.\n\nThere are now over 5 million Americans with roots in South Asia. Plus, there are expats from other cricket hotbeds — the U.K., Australia, South Africa and the Caribbean.\n\nThe next question is, “Would Americans take this on wholesale? And that’s probably going to take a lot longer,” said Stefan Szymanski, a professor of sport management at the University of Michigan.\n\nMajor League Cricket is keeping its ambitions relatively small for now, with the season just two weeks long. And even though all of its matches will be played in Texas and North Carolina this year, its teams are assigned homes — Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Washington and Texas, all locations where the league hopes to build stadiums.\n\nEven if it manages to expand, profitability could be further off, said Victor Matheson, a sports economist at the College of the Holy Cross.\n\n“This is not something you measure success in months or years. It really is something you measure in decades,” Matheson said.\n\nEven the NFL took that long to get a foothold, he said.\n\n“The folks that think, you know, ‘Oh, if we can just get through year one or two, we’re set,’ are deceiving themselves,” Matheson added.\n\nThe league said its inaugural season will be broadcast in cricketing nations around the world, and if you want to watch it here, you have to subscribe to a channel called Willow TV.",

    "body": "The dying Sri Lankan cricket journalist who narrates Shehan Karunatilaka’s deranged and gorgeous novel “Chinaman” declares that, “unlike life, sport matters.” At the Grand Prairie Stadium on the outskirts of Dallas, during the first game of Major League Cricket, there were many people in the crowd who felt a similar devotion. Cricket is a sport of simple principles—whichever team scores more runs cannot lose—and seductive and near-endless subtleties. It is capable of inflicting lifelong ardor upon those exposed to a sufficiently large dose. Ravi Negi, a thirty-eight-year-old spectator at the game, was clearly one of its victims. He grew up with cricket in Hyderabad, India, which he left in 2007 when he immigrated to the U.S., and has since played in a local league on weekends. Now he watched every ball at the Grand Prairie Stadium with a nervy intensity, even though he was not particularly invested in who was going to win. A fielding mistake looked as if it caused him physical pain. Was he happy? I asked him.\n\n“Happy?” he said. “I’m very happy.”\n\nMajor League Cricket is the latest attempt to bring professional cricket to the U.S. The first game, on July 13th, was contested by the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders, two of six new franchises whose squads mix recognizable international stars of the sport with domestic players. (The other teams are the Washington Freedom, M.I. New York, the Seattle Orcas, and the San Francisco Unicorns.) The league’s opening tournament this summer is taking place over eighteen days, and nineteen matches, and is being played in two stadiums, the other one being in Morrisville, North Carolina. Another member of the crowd in Texas, Michael Klinski, had driven thirteen hours with his wife and four kids, from South Dakota. During his childhood summers, Klinski, who is forty-one, used to visit relatives in England, where he fell in love with cricket, and he still plays in a local league in Sioux Falls. “The history, the excitement, how passionate people are about it,” he said, explaining his affection for the sport. “There is more jeopardy in cricket. When you’re out, you’re out.”\n\nBeing a cricket lover in America has meant being starved of high-class domestic competition, and hunger can make you do irrational things—like driving from South Dakota to watch a game between two teams that have been conjured out of thin air and a checkbook. The organizers of Major League Cricket were counting on the devotion of American cricket’s small but fervent fan base. They needed their Negis and Klinskis to show up. Eventually, on a roasting night in a Texas heat wave, they did.\n\nIn another fine cricket novel—“Netherland,” by Joseph O’Neill—Chuck Ramkissoon, a grandiloquent Trinidadian American entrepreneur, dreams of bringing cricket to America. Chuck conjures the sport’s deep roots in the United States, as “the first modern team sport in America”—a game played by hundreds of clubs in the nineteenth century, in front of thousands of fans. (In an uncharacteristic oversight, Chuck fails to mention that Abraham Lincoln was one such fan; reportedly, the future President watched Chicago play Milwaukee in 1849.) Chuck writes to potential investors in his scheme by e-mail:\n\nIt is wrong to see cricket in America as most people see it i.e. an immigrant sport. It is a bona fide American pastime. . . . All those who have attempted to “introduce” cricket to the American public have failed to understand this. Cricket is already in the American DNA. With proper promotion, marketing, government support etc awareness of the game could easily be reawakened. American kids could once again play their country’s oldest team sport!\n\nChuck would have admired the ambition of M.L.C. The league has been driven by Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, who, twenty-one years ago, launched a cricket-streaming service called Willow TV; and M.L.C. is backed with an initial hundred and twenty million dollars in investment from tech executives such as Satya Nadella, the C.E.O. of Microsoft, and Texas businessmen including Ross Perot, Jr., the son of the former Presidential candidate. (“Don’t ask me a hard question,” Perot told me at one point in the stands. He meant a question about the laws of cricket, on which he was still a novice.) Strengthening its chances, M.L.C. has also partnered with two teams in Australia and four in the Indian Premier League—the world’s most successful and lucrative cricket competition in the sport’s biggest market—whose current valuation is reported to be more than ten billion dollars. Hence there is a team in M.L.C. called M.I. New York—which makes no sense until you realize that its Indian counterpart is the Mumbai Indians.\n\nLike the I.P.L., the American league plays T20, the most popular short form of cricket, in which each team has up to a hundred and twenty balls to score as many runs as possible, and which prioritizes aggressive batting and canny bowling. Test cricket, played between international teams wearing white uniforms over two innings and five days, is considered by many cricket lovers to be the highest form of the game—the classic movie to T20’s YouTube video—and English cricket fans are currently gripped by the test series with Australia. But, in some parts of the world, the long form of the game is ailing.\n\nM.L.C.’s money has bought talent. Jason Roy, an English batter who is signed to the L.A. Knight Riders, is reported to be receiving around four hundred thousand dollars to play in the first two seasons of the tournament. And, because he was still needed to play in the finals of the English domestic T20 season on Saturday, he was not even in Texas for L.A.’s first game. Roy’s deal is similar to those of other big stars who’ve joined M.L.C. Each franchise can have up to nineteen players in its squad; at most, nine of them can be international. (Only eleven per team can play a match.) The total budget for salaries is capped at around $1.15 million per squad. It’s not N.B.A. money, but in the world of international cricket there are few places outside India where the best players can earn as much in such a short period.\n\nPerot’s partner in a venture-capital firm that he runs, and also his co-investor in M.L.C., Anurag Jain, was confident that—particularly because of the many millions of South Asian and other immigrants from cricket-playing countries in the United States—there was enough of a market already to support the league. The organizers of M.L.C. said the U.S. is roughly the third- or fourth-largest TV market for cricket globally. (This year, Willow TV is covering most of the games, and CBS Sports Network is covering at least three; in the future, the league hopes to have a regular mainstream-TV partner.) “This season is about giving a taste to people,” he said. “Get the people here, get the right talent, get the stadium, get the fans used to all of these things. Then next season move onward. Use it as a springboard,” Jain said.\n\nThe dissonance of watching cricket in Dallas was overwhelming. The stadium itself had been converted from baseball only recently, and still contained its old scoreboard, with boxes for “inning,” “ball,” “strike,” and “out.” Around the stadium were signs warning spectators to be mindful of balls struck into the crowd—written in English and in Spanish. The police officers wore Stetsons. “The Star-Spangled Banner” was sung before play began.\n\nStill, some things about cricket are always the same. The oval field was apple-green; in a dry, hundred-and-four-degree heat, the color seemed almost obscene. In the middle was the square, the mown, straw-colored twenty-two-yard strip, or “pitch,” on which the players would bat and bowl. The surface looked good for batting. I later discovered that an Australian groundsman, David Agnew, had laid and tended the turf. Before play began, he guessed that the pitch might yield a score of around 180. The first team to bat, the Texas Super Kings, scored 181.\n\nThe match was, for the most part, entertaining. The star South African batter for Texas, Faf du Plessis, was out on his first ball—chipping an easy catch to a fielder off the bowling of the New Zealander Lockie Ferguson—but Texas rallied with explosive batting from David Miller and Devon Conway, of South Africa and New Zealand, respectively. To me, the joy was in watching Sunil Narine, the Trinidadian captain of Los Angeles, bowl. I had spoken to him the previous day, and, despite the bafflement of many Texans who had asked him what he was doing in Dallas, he was optimistic about the prospects for the league. (“Things could go big here—like, very big,” he told me.) Narine is what is known as a mystery spinner, because he can spin the ball off the pitch in a variety of ways, none predictable. Moreover, as he runs up to bowl, he hides the ball behind his back, to obscure the view of his grip from the batter—a pleasingly cartoon-villain-ish ploy. I allowed myself a brief clap of appreciation when Narine got one of the Texas batters out—what in cricket is known as “taking a wicket.”\n\nBy then, the stadium, which had been perhaps two-thirds full at the start of play, at 7:30 P.M., was almost at its capacity of seventy-two hundred. The sun had set, and, in darkness, the heat in the stadium was somewhat bearable. The crowd consisted, I guessed, of at least ninety per cent preëxisting fans of cricket, mostly of South Asian heritage. I was interested in finding new recruits to the sport, but they were thin on the ground. Christian, who had played pickup cricket with Indian-immigrant colleagues of his father’s when he was a child, had brought his girlfriend, Jamie, to watch the match. She knew nothing about cricket except for what the Internet could teach her. “I watched, like, four videos to come here, and I understood about three per cent of what’s happening,” she said. “He also acted it out for me in the living room.”\n\n“Come on,” Christian implored. “You know the ways to get wickets.”\n\nJamie smiled and shrugged. There was no help on the giant screens for anybody who had never previously watched cricket—nothing to explain the laws or the customs of the sport, which is strange to the vast majority of Americans. This seemed to me like an oversight on the part of the organizers. But they were counting on enough already devoted fans so that they wouldn’t need too many newcomers—at least at first. Perot told me during the game, “This is year one. It’s like venture capital. You want to take care of that dedicated fan base. And then you want to grow the fan base.”\n\nThe arrival of a promising professional cricket league in America marks a significant moment in a revolution in men’s cricket that began with the first season of the I.P.L, in 2008. (Women’s cricket, which is increasingly popular, is behind the men’s sport in commercial terms.) Before the Indian league transformed the finances of the sport, professionals generally played domestic cricket in their own country, often on miserly wages. The best players represented their nation, in which case they were paid more. Some pros travelled to earn money overseas, but in general the very best players were rooted in the country that they hoped to represent. The I.P.L. drafted players from all over the world, onto teams with huge budgets that often paid more for a short tournament in India than other leagues could offer for the rest of the year on traditional contracts. (In that first I.P.L. auction, in 2008, the Indian star M. S. Dhoni was bought by the Chennai Super Kings for one and a half million dollars.) Since then, other T20 leagues have emerged around the world, offering good, if not Indian-level, money. Some of the best players began to reduce their commitment to—or even forgo entirely—longer, so-called red-ball games of cricket, to play white-ball, or short-form, cricket around the world.\n\nEd Smith, who played for England, then selected its men’s national team, and was also a consultant to the head coach of an I.P.L. team, sees the birth of the Indian league and the subsequent explosion of franchise cricket as a natural development. “It’s often presented as a rupture with the way things ought to be,” he said. “But, in actual fact, the I.P.L. only righted a disequilibrium, rather than created a disequilibrium. The vast majority of cricket fans live in India. That’s where cricket’s economy is. And the market forces, you may or may not like them, but they are a fact of life like gravity. . . . It may be that the emergence of a functioning cricketing economy in America is one way in which cricket’s ecosystem becomes more balanced rather than less.”\n\nSunil Narine is an excellent example of an itinerant craftsman who has flourished in the world of franchise cricket. He last played a test match for the West Indies in 2013. Since then, between T20 internationals, his professional life has led him to the following teams: the Kolkata Knight Riders (India), the Sydney Sixers (Australia), the Guyana Amazon Warriors (the Caribbean), the Cape Cobras (South Africa), the Comilla Victorians (Bangladesh), the Montreal Tigers (Canada), the Trinbago Knight Riders (the Caribbean), the Melbourne Renegades (Australia), the Lahore Qalandars (Pakistan), the Dhaka Dynamites (Bangladesh), the Oval Invincibles (England), the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders (the United Arab Emirates), and, finally, the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nAnother Trinidadian, Kieron Pollard, captains M.I. New York. He is a big and powerful player; he doesn’t so much hit a cricket ball as seek to maim it. Nobody in the world has played more T20s than Pollard (six hundred and twenty-six games and counting). But, he told me, his decision to pursue a more commercial path and play franchise cricket was unpopular with traditionalists in the West Indies. He was, he says, branded “a mercenary” and “nonpatriotic.” Now he watched with a certain amount of satisfaction as the sport’s administrators scrambled to balance the commercial lure of franchise cricket with the traditional domestic game. “There’s still room for all forms of the game,” Pollard said. “But, a hundred per cent, there is going to be a lot of clashing going forward.”\n\nThe Texas Super Kings won the tournament’s opening game easily enough in the end. During the Texas innings, fans in the bleachers waved yellow flags when one of their men hit a good shot. But, when the Los Angeles innings began, it seemed as if a suspicious number of people were waving purple L.A. flags. If the teams in this competition engender no real loyalty yet, that is understandable. They are brand-new. Moreover, all of the matches in this year’s competition are being played in only two venues, making the connection of teams to home cities more tenuous. (Pity the diehard Seattle Orcas fan at this year’s tournament.)\n\nBefore Los Angeles succumbed, its Jamaican star, Andre Russell, scored a flurry of runs—prompting appreciative cries, even from spectators wearing yellow shirts. In the press box, above the old baseball scoreboard, a young team of digital journalists was furiously uploading new content to the league’s social-media accounts. One of the reporters, a cricket aficionado in his early twenties, took a pause as Russell hit a ball out of the stadium and into the parking lot. He turned to a colleague and said, “Bro, it’s so crazy: Andre Russell is playing in Texas.” ♦",

The team is based in Houston, Texas. It was formed in 2020 as part of 24 original teams to compete in Minor League Cricket.[1] The franchise is owned by Kuldeep Patel and Sakhi Muhammad.[2]\n\nThe team's home ground is Moosa Stadium, located in Pearland, Texas.[3] Team captain Sidhesh Pathare helms captaincy duties, while Shayan Jahangir stands by as vice-captain.[4]\n\nCaptain Nitish Kumar and American cricketer Laksh Parikh lead the bowling and batting leaderboards with 407 runs and 20 wickets respectively.[5][6]\n\nFranchise history[edit]\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nTalks of an American Twenty20 league started in November 2018 just before USA Cricket became the new governing body of cricket in the United States.[7][8] In May 2021, USA Cricket announced they had accepted a bid by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) for a US$1 billion investment covering the league and other investments benefitting the U.S. national teams.[9]\n\nIn an Annual General Meeting on February 21, 2020, it was announced that USA Cricket was planning to launch Major League Cricket in 2021 and Minor League Cricket that summer,[10] but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic[11] and due to the lack of high-quality cricket stadiums in the USA.[12] Major League Cricket was pushed to a summer-2023 launch[13] and Minor League Cricket was pushed back to July 31, 2021.[14]\n\nUSA Cricket CEO Iain Higgins also pointed out cities such as New York City, Houston and Los Angeles with a large cricket fanbase, and targeted them among others as launch cities for Minor League Cricket.[15]\n\nExhibition league[edit]\n\nIn July 2020, the player registration for the Minor League Cricket exhibition league began.[16] On August 15, 2020, USA Cricket announced the teams participating in the exhibition league matches, also listing the owners for each team.[17] The draft for the exhibition league began on August 22, 2020,[18] with the Lone Star Athletics releasing their squad on August 24.[19] Willem Ludick was later named as captain for the Lone Star Athletics for the exhibition league.[19]\n\n2021 season[edit]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the exhibition league, USA Cricket announced that they were planning to launch the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket in spring 2021.[20] Ahead of the official season, which was announced to kick off on July 31,[21] the Athletics announced Sidhesh Pathare as captain with Shayan Jahangir helming vice-captain duties.[4]\n\nThroughout the group stage, the Athletics won twice against the Catchers, the Mustangs, the Stars, and the Americans,[22] but they won once against the Master Blasters, the Lashings, the Surf Riders, and the Hurricanes.[23] However, the Athletics lost twice against the Chicago Blasters and the Hurricanes.[24] The Athletics' good performance in the group stage allowed for them to proceed to the quarter-finals.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, the Athletics were matched up with eventual title winners, Silicon Valley Strikers.[25] However, the Athletics lost to the Strikers in a best-of-three game series 2-1.[26]\n\n2022 season[edit]\n\nAhead of the 2022 season, Major League Cricket announced that it was renaming the Austin Athletics to the Lone Star Athletics.[27] MLC also announced that the draft for that season would take place on May 12.[28]\n\nCurrent squad[edit]\n\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\n\nName

Even if Andre Russell scores the fastest T20 hundred in the edition or Anrich Nortje registers his career-best figures, the feats will be relegated to the “miscellaneous” or the “other T20” section in the database of the statisticians.\n\nIs the MLC sanctioned by the ICC?\n\nThe Major League Cricket has been sanctioned by USA Cricket after initial disputes with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the league’s organisers. Soon after the country’s official administrative body approved the league, the International Cricket Council sanctioned the league as well. The stamp of approval by the ICC allowed the Full Members to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to their players to participate in the league.\n\nIf the league had not been sanctioned by the ICC, it would have been termed Disapproved Cricket, with Members requested not to provide NOCs to their cricketers.\n\nAny tournament that does not adhere to ICC’s guidelines is an unsanctioned league. Players who take part in such events can face consequences, varying from fines to lifetime bans. The Indian Cricket League, held between 2007 and 2009, was termed a “rebel league” with all players being banned from other events.\n\nIf the MLC is ICC-sanctioned, why doesn’t it have official status?\n\nThe ICC can approve leagues anywhere in the world if the formalities are in order as per the Regulations on Sanctioning of Cricket Events. However, a nod of approval by the ICC only means that players from across the world can take part in the tournament without the fear of being debarred.\n\nOn the other hand, a league is given official status only if it is hosted by a Full Member country. The ICC regulations state that sanctioned events hosted by non-Full Member countries cannot have stats and records attributed to them.\n\nAs the MLC is being held in the USA, an Associate country, it does not have official status. The lack of official status does not mean that the MLC is not a legitimate tournament. It simply means that the records achieved by the players during the tournament will not be counted towards their career statistics.\n\nWhich other leagues do not have official status?\n\nA number of T10 leagues in the world do not have official status, including the Abu Dhabi T10 League or the upcoming US Masters T10 League.\n\nThe Global T20 Canada, which was held in 2018 and 2019, did not have official status, and neither did this year’s ILT20, which was hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a non-Full-Member country.",
    "summary": "* The MLC has attracted international stars but does not have official T20 status, meaning records achieved during the tournament will not be reflected in players' career stats.\n* The MLC is sanctioned by USA Cricket and the International Cricket Council (ICC), which allows players from Full Members to participate in the league.\n* Despite being ICC-sanctioned, the MLC does not have official status because it is being held in the USA, an Associate country, and not a Full Member country.\n* Other leagues that do not have official status include T10 leagues like the Abu Dhabi T10 League and the US Masters T10 League, as well as the Global T20 Canada and the ILT20, which was hosted by the United Arab Emirates.\n* The lack of official status does not mean the MLC is not a legitimate tournament, but rather that records achieved during the tournament will not be counted towards players' career statistics.",

This is such a grand event. There was an unbelievable atmosphere and I want to thank each and every individual who has come out here,” he said.\n\nSuper Kings batsman David Miller, who was awarded Player of the Match for his hard-hitting 61 from 42 balls, including four sixes, was also impressed.\n\n“It’s fantastic to see such a great turnout and the facilities have been fantastic. I think there have been a few guys, kind of questioned around what it was going to be like but it shot the lights out here,” said the South African, one of a number of players with a background in the world’s top Twenty20 competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nMLC has backing from four IPL franchises including the Mumbai Indians, whose New York team began play on Friday.\n\nEngland opening batsman Jason Roy, Australian batsman Aaron Finch, South African pace bowler Kagiso Rabada and West Indies spinner Sunil Narine are among the foreign players drafted by the six teams.\n\nOther games will be played in Morrisville, North Carolina, before the playoffs and final return to Texas.\n\nAs well as the involvement of IPL teams, Australia’s Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns, and Cricket New South Wales has a similar role with the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe league has broadcast deals with streaming service Willow TV, whose owners are also investors in MLC, and also with Viacom18 in India.",

    "body": "The United States will get its first taste of professional cricket on Thursday night with the launch of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC). Six teams will compete in T20, the quickest version of the game, with matches taking part across two sites with some serious star power on display for its first season.\n\nIf you’ve never watched cricket before, you’re curious about the sport, or just want to see what it’s all about then buckle in, because here’s everything you need to know in order be prepared for the first ball on Thursday night.\n\nWhat is T20 cricket?\n\nThe “20” in T20 stands for the overs each side has to score runs. An over is six balls delivered by a single bowler in succession. At that time a new bowler takes over, bowls six balls, and the process continues.\n\nTeams need to score as many runs as possible off the 180 balls as possible, and have 10 wickets (or outs) to make this happen.\n\nBecause of the need to score extremely quickly to build a big lead or chase the opponent’s total, T20 is traditionally where you see players swing for the fences and take the most risks while batting. There’s also innate strategy built into the batting order, when to use spin bowling as opposed to fast bowling, as well as balancing the risk/reward of taking shots that could rack up runs, but at the cost of giving up easy wickets.\n\nWho are the teams in Major League Cricket and where are they playing?\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nMI New York\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nThese teams will compete at two dedicated sites for the first season. A 12,000 seat cricket ground has been opened in Grand Prairie, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), with a 7,000 seat ground operating in Morrisville, North Carolina (part of the Raleigh-Durham area).\n\nWho are the players to watch?\n\nThe inaugural season boasts the best players in the United States (many of whom even the most dedicated cricket fans haven’t heard of), alongside some surprisingly big names from international cricket. Of the international players entering the league we have:\n\nRashid Khan\n\nShadab Khan\n\nHaris Rauf\n\nFaf du Plessis\n\nDavid Miller\n\nSunil Narine\n\nKieron Pollard\n\nAndre Russell\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nAaron Finch\n\nJason Roy\n\nTrent Boult\n\nAt one point all of these players were some of the best T20 players in the world and all represented their countries at an international level.\n\nHow to watch\n\nMLC has partnered with cricket streaming service WillowTV for broadcast rights in the United States. Internationally it can be watched in Australia (FOX), the Caribbean (SportsMax), New Zealand (Sky NZ), Pakistan (A Sports), South Africa (SuperSport) and the United Kingdom (BT Sport), and India (Viacom18).\n\nThe first match between the Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders will take place at 8:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, July 13.",

There are some big names in international cricket who will represent the six teams of the MLC in the inaugural season.\n\nThere are a few Pakistani players who will take part in the MLC 2023 across the six teams. Although no current Pakistan stars could grab a deal, we will witness some former Pakistan players in the tournament.\n\nMLC 2023: Pakistan Players in Major League Cricket\n\nTake a look at all players in the MLC 2023 who have represented Pakistan at the international level-\n\nNauman Anwar (Seattle Orcas)\n\nNauman Anwar is a 27-year-old batting all-rounder who will play for Seattle Orcas in the MLC 2023.

Ahmed is known for his breathtaking batting and can also bowl a fair bit of leg-spin with it.\n\nSaad Ali (Washington Freedom)\n\nSaad Ali was a bright prospect for Pakistan cricket who came through the U-19 ranks. The batter was picked up for Test squads against England and has played for his country.\n\nHis international career spanned just 2 matches though, as his debut against Australia back in 2019 was not a rosy one. The southpaw scored 11 runs in two matches and hasn't played for his country since.\n\nThe 29-year-old has played in Pakistan Super League (PSL) for the likes of Quetta Gladiators and Lahore Qalandars.\n\nHammad Azam (MI New York)\n\nHammad Azam is part of the MI New York team which have some gigantic names in the squad.

He also has 2 ODI wickets in his name. Azam also played 5 T20I matches for Pakistan.\n\nEhsan Adil (MI New York)\n\nEhsan Adil is a fast bowler who has represented Pakistan in Test cricket. The 30-year-old pacer has played 3 Tests and made his debut back in 2013 against South Africa.

Aslam also has 7 Test fifties to his name and can be an important cog in the TSK setup at the inaugural MLC season.",

Games will be played in the Twenty20 (T20) format.\n\n\"It's a game that's always exciting,\" Anderson said. \"There's always something happening. You're never going to get the same game twice. It's one of those sports that once you start watching it, coming to a game live is the best way to do it.\"\n\nJustin Geale is the director of cricket for MLC. He said Grand Prairie has the type of infrastructure to support the players and the teams.\n\n\"What a place to do it,\" Geale said. \"It's close to the airport. You have great hotels and infrastructure. There's also a really supportive local government. I think and I hope all my American friends love it. And I hope the general population will, too.\"\n\nThe stadium will be a 7,200-capacity venue’s playing pitch with construction set to be complete in spring 2023. Grand Prairie Stadium will be the competition’s primary venue for the 2023 season and home venue for Dallas’ MLC team. More details on the Dallas franchise – including its team name and identity – will be unveiled in early 2023.\n\n\"I think it fits with the profile of Grand Prairie,\" Geale said. \"I think it fits with the sporting community around here.\"\n\nMLC’s investor group includes Dallas-based investors Ross Perot Jr. and Anurag Jain.\n\n“Grand Prairie Stadium will be the best cricket venue in the United States upon its completion,” Grand Prairie mayor Ron Jensen said in a press release. “This venue will be a huge asset to the Grand Prairie community, bringing Major League Cricket, international cricket and potentially the 2024 ICC T20 Men’s World Cup to Grand Prairie allowing fans here to experience a world class sport in action.”\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium is the former home of the Texas AirHogs. The venue will feature 1,000 club and premium seats with the ability to expand to a capacity of over 15,000 for major events. It is expected to host matches at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024, set to be co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies.\n\n\"I think just the spectacle of being a 360 game,\" Anderson said. \"All around the ground.

We’ve had very productive conversations with MLC and the lead investors of the San Francisco team over the last few months which have led us to this point,” Cummins said.\n\n“Beyond that, we have a responsibility to present new opportunities to Victorian cricket.

MLC franchise and Cricket NSW last month, we are thrilled that another globally recognized cricket organization like Cricket Victoria shares our vision to advance the sport of cricket in the United States. Cricket Victoria’s experience in growing the Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades to become two of Australia’s most recognizable sporting franchises will provide invaluable assistance to the San Francisco MLC franchise ahead of the upcoming season.”\n\nABOUT MAJOR LEAGUE CRICKET\n\nMajor League Cricket will be the first professional Twenty20 cricket championship in the United States.

    "date": "Thu Jul 27 14:45:20 2023",
    "body": "The world’s second most popular sport and the world’s largest sports market have finally gotten together.\n\nMajor League Cricket—a U.S.-based pro cricket league—is wrapping up its inaugural season this week with playoffs and a championship game scheduled for Sunday. Aimed primarily at the 5 million South Asian expats in the U.S., the six participating cricket teams feature a mix of worldwide cricket stars and domestic talent.\n\nCricket attracts more than 2.5 billion fans globally, only trailing soccer, according to Front Office Sports.\n\nWhile cricket hasn't permeated U.S. sports culture quite yet, the league has managed to draw attention from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and New York Magazine, among other outlets. And in terms of the game's fans, Major League Cricket was a smashing success, said Tom Dunmore, VP of marketing for the league.\n\n“The amount of energy and attention locally, nationally and globally has been completely mind-blowing,” Dunmore said. “We’ve sold out more than two-thirds of our matches and we could have sold more tickets to many of our matches. The atmosphere has been incredible, and the fans have been so passionate. There are hundreds of fans waiting to get autographs, desperate to meet their heroes. It’s hard to convey to American mainstream sports followers and media just how big superstars these players are.”\n\nRashid Khan, a bowler for MLC’s MI New York squad with 7 million Instagram followers and a Monster Energy endorsement deal, is one of them.\n\nThe league was able to secure top stars due to its short season—just 18 days long beginning earlier this month—that doesn’t interfere with other pro leagues in places such as India, England and Australia. And unlike most U.S. team sport athletes, cricket pros aren’t bound to a single team or league.\n\n“To get [Lionel] Messi, [Inter Miami] had to pay a lot of money and it’s still hard [for Major League Soccer] to get top stars in their prime,” Dunmore said. “We can bring over the top stars in their prime for these short tournaments and they compete at the same level as they would in the top cricket countries. We’re immediately able to be at the top level of the sport, and the fans recognize that.”\n\nAlso read: See Lay's US welcome message to Messi made of goats\n\n$1 billion investment\n\nThe league is backed by a $1 billion investment from American Cricket Enterprises, a group funded by Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, the founders of Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America; and Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain, the principals of The Times of India Group, India’s largest media conglomerate. Other investors include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nLeague corporate partners include Royal, the U.S.-based Indian foods brand; Abound by the Times of India, a financial app aimed at Indian expats; Cloudchef, an AI recipe and food delivery app; Sling; Betbricks7, a casino games app; and Betway, the online betting and gaming brand.\n\nRoyal this month debuted its first U.S. ad to promote awareness of the sport’s inaugural season. “The Many Flavors of Cricket,” from the agency McCann, displays the blending of culture, cuisine and cricket.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of South Asians in the United States have arrived in the U.S. in the last 15 years, so they are living a somewhat plural existence. Connection to culture, language, and traditions become even more important when you are living abroad,” Andrew Cops, senior VP of sales, marketing and product development for LT Foods, Royal’s parent, said in emailed remarks. “Major League Cricket’s inaugural season was the perfect opportunity to bring our cultural goals to life through the fusion of the exhilarating sport and delicacies synonymous with the experience.”\n\nMLC games are broadcast by Willow and streamed by Sling, with some games airing on Paramount’s CBS Sports Network. The league consists of six teams representing Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Washington, D.C., and New York City. This season, most games were played at a converted minor league baseball stadium near Dallas, with others at a cricket facility known as Church Street Park near Raleigh, North Carolina. Plans call for teams to eventually establish their own home parks.\n\nMLC plays a version of cricket known as Twenty20, or T20, which refers to the 20 “overs,” or set of six pitches, each team is limited to. The result, said Dunmore, is a faster-moving game with more action. T20 games typically take less than three hours to complete; traditional “test” cricket has matches that can last for five days.\n\nDunmore said the league would look to widen its fanbase in coming years. “Our goal this year was to build on this established platform of cricket lovers. That’s the base we can build off. From that, we can reach out to different types of fans and grow the sport more broadly, and there’s a lot of ways we can do that: education, outreach, influencers, and partnerships with other sports teams,” he said. “We did just a little bit of that this year, but that’s a year two, three, four activation for us.”",

    "body": "Tech wizards who made their mark as early investors in Facebook and selling startups to Amazon and Walmart are the men behind the San Franciso team propelling Aaron Finch and Marcus Stoinis into the new world of elite cricket in the United States.\n\nFinch will captain the San Francisco Unicorns and Stoinis will be one of his major weapons as part of the six-team Major League Cricket Twenty20 competition which kicks off in July as the most ambitious attempt yet to take the sport beyond club level in the US.\n\n“Any time a new competition starts - especially somewhere like the US, where they haven’t had a huge amount of cricket before - it’s exciting,” Finch told the Herald and The Age. “The opportunity to get into the league at the start was really attractive.”\n\nLead investors in the San Francisco team, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, are mates from Chennai who did PhDs in computer science at Stanford University and have become successful entrepreneurs.\n\nUnited by their love of cricket, they once set up a satellite dish on a hall at Stanford so the many cricket fans on campus from South Asia and beyond could watch the 1996 World Cup in India.\n\nRemarkably, North America, combining the US and Canada through Willow TV, is now the third-largest market for Cricket Australia’s television rights behind India and England and has been for some time, highlighting the potential size of a market crying out for organisation and investment.\n\nWillow TV founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, who sold it to the Times of India in 2016 for $150 million, are behind Major League Cricket.\n\nSpeaking from San Francisco this week, Rajaraman sounded even more enthusiastic than Finch about the impending launch of MLC.\n\n“I’m super excited,” Rajaraman told the Herald and The Age. “It’s all going to come down to the quality of the cricket that gets played and I think it will be super high-quality cricket.\n\n“We really have a shot of becoming, in the long run, one of the top three T20 tournaments in the world. That’s where we’ve set our sights and we think it’s possible.”\n\nLeading overseas players in the MLC can earn $260,000 for five matches and a potential final compared to top Big Bash players without marketing deals, who max out at about $220,000 for 14 games plus finals.\n\nSan Francisco has a partnership with Cricket Victoria, which will provide staff and expertise for the tournament along with players, hence the signing of Finch from the Renegades and Stoinis from the Stars, with the likelihood of more to come.\n\nThey will be joined by former World Cup-winning England fast bowler Liam Plunkett and former New Zealand allrounder Corey Anderson, who are among 46 former first-class cricketers now living and playing in the US’s Minor League.\n\nLoading\n\nVictoria followed a model first set up by Cricket NSW in a partnership with Washington Freedom, which is likely to see NSW players join that franchise. Washington Freedom have combined with George Mason University to study the feasibility of a new multi-purpose cricket and baseball facility.\n\nThe Freedom have signed the world’s fastest bowler, South African Anrich Nortje, and Sri Lankan leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga.\n\nThe remaining four teams are essentially owned or run by IPL teams, which has already had a direct impact with the signing of Mitch Marsh by the Seattle Orcas, who are co-owned by the Delhi Capitals, Marsh’s IPL club. He will be joined at the Orcas by former South African captain Quinton de Kock.\n\nOther MLC franchises with IPL connections are the Texas Super Kings, MI (Mumbai Indians) New York and Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nThe biggest hurdle to the event are the petty administrative squabbles which have held cricket in the US back for decades.\n\nThe International Cricket Council has sent letters to major cricketing countries saying that USA Cricket, which has a long-term agreement with MLC, have not sanctioned the event. However, an MLC spokesman said the necessary sanction was expected in the coming days.\n\nCricinfo reported that the hold-up may be a ploy by USA Cricket to try and extract more revenue from MLC investors.\n\nThere has been a concerted effort in recent years to raise the standard of cricket in the US through the Minor League, with a two-week trial of the best players before an inaugural Major League draft for local players held early this week.\n\nLoading\n\nVictoria and NSW, who are compiling team lists and overseeing high performance for their franchise partners, sent representatives to the trials and the draft.\n\nCricket Victoria’s CEO Nick Cummins and Cricket NSW head of elite male cricket, Michael Klinger, were impressed with the quality of local players, describing them as ranging from BBL to Premier Club (Grade Cricket) standard.\n\nThe combined start-up costs for the MLC and the six clubs, which are all privately owned, is estimated at $180 million. And up to that much again will be invested in the coming years building elite venues for each team in a country where baseball diamonds and rectangular football fields dominate the landscape.",

Cricket is also an ancestor to baseball where athletes attempt to hit thrown leather balls with large, wooden bats. Instead of bases, there are wickets on the field where the batsman runs to and from in order to score — it’s a real hoot.\n\nThere are forms of cricket in which a single match can last several days. But the Orcas will play in what’s called Twenty20 cricket — an abbreviated version with more manageable, two-and-a-half-hour matches.\n\nWhere can I watch our team?\n\nLast spring, plans began for a 20-acre Redmond site at Marymoor Park that aims to seat 6,000 fans. Local officials have given the green light for the facility, but Major League Cricket said that it may not host the Orcas until 2025 because of the time it will take to design and construct.",

    "date": "Wed Jul 12 10:00:00 2023",
    "body": "It's time to shift our gaze to the five bowlers to look out for in the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket. The list includes the raw pace of Anrich Nortje and the mystery spin of Sunil Narine.\n\nAnrich Nortje\n\nFor all the cutters and slower bumpers having been introduced in the game over the last decade, there is still no substitute for pace. Because, when the speedometer reads 90 mph or more, there's a chance that the lesser mortals go in survival mode and focus on self-preservation rather than going on an all-out offence which is the name of the game in T20 cricket.\n\nSouth African speedster and now Washington Freedom import Anrich Nortje is easily the fastest bowler in world cricket at the moment alongside England's Mark Wood and is sure to rattle a few batters in the inaugural Major League Cricket tournament. One can only imagine that when even the best batters in the business fail to tackle Nortje's searing pace at times, how would the local players fare against the Protea tearaway.\n\nAnrich Nortje would be one of the favourites to top the leading wicket takers in the tournament over at betway satta and is 2-1 to be top wicket taker in their opening match against Seattle Orcas\n\nRashid Khan\n\nIf a tearaway wasn't enough, the MLC batters will have to deal with the mystery spin of Rashid Khan as well who is arguably the best T20 bowler in the world at the moment. Rashid not only captains his national side Afghanistan but has set the global T20 circuit on fire with match-winning performances across the board.\n\nThe spin maestro was recently part of defending IPL champions Gujarat Titans who ended up as runners-up in the 2023 edition. Along with compatriot Noor Ahmad, Rashid made life hell for the batters and the fate of a lot of teams in MLC will depend on how they tackle the leg spin, the googly, the top spin and a host of other variations from Khan.\n\nTrent Boult\n\nDepending on the ball used and the atmospheric conditions, Trent Boult will extract massive or little swing in Major League Cricket 2023. Be that as it may, the Kiwi would be a handful to handle for all openers inside the powerplay.\n\nBoult, who is not part of a traditional central contract with NZC at the moment, has already decided to turn a freelance T20 globetrotter for the remaining years of his career, and will have another opportunity to display his chops in the upcoming competition.\n\nThe left-armer has the rare ability to bring the ball back into the right-handers from over the wicket and swing the new nut quite late which always poses tough questions for the openers.\n\nSunil Narine\n\nLike compatriot Andre Russell, Sunil Narine hasn't been at his absolute best over the last couple of years, but the mystery spinner still remains among the best in the world.\n\nCarrying forward his long-standing association with the Kolkata Knight Riders, Narine will ply his trade for Los Angeles Knight Riders in MLC 2023 alongside Andre Russell, Jason Roy, Lockie Ferguson, Martin Guptill, Adam Zampa, Rilee Rossouw, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan and Unmukt Chand.\n\nNarine provides great value due to his ability to bowl in any phase of the game - be it the powerplay, the middle overs, or the death. At his prime, Narine not only kept the runs dry but also picked truckloads of wickets. At the fag end of his career, even if he can do one of the two tasks, Los Angeles Knight Riders will have their money's worth. And don't forget his ability with the bat at the top of the order.\n\nLockie Ferguson\n\nMuch like Anrich Nortje, New Zealand's Lockie Ferguson has the ability to hit 95 mph and is capable of instilling fear in the opposition players - particularly the local batters.\n\nLockie Ferguson did not have a great IPL 2023, but he is a tried and tested player who hasn't compromised on his pace over the years. Used by New Zealand as a middle overs enforcer in the 2019 ODI World Cup, Ferguson can play the same role for Los Angeles Knight Riders, and with some distinction.\n\n© Cricket World 2023",
    "summary": "The article highlights five bowlers to watch out for in the inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket tournament. The bowlers are:\n\n1. Anrich Nortje (Washington Freedom) - A fast bowler from South Africa known for his raw pace, expected to rattle batsmen in the tournament.\n2. Rashid Khan (no team mentioned) - A mystery spin bowler from Afghanistan, considered one of the best T20 bowlers in the world.\n3. Trent Boult (no team mentioned) - A left-arm swing bowler from New Zealand, known for his ability to extract swing and pose tough questions for openers.\n4. Sunil Narine (Los Angeles Knight Riders) - A mystery spinner from the West Indies, known for his ability to bowl in any phase of the game and provide great value to his team.\n5. Lockie Ferguson (Los Angeles Knight Riders) - A fast bowler from New Zealand, capable of hitting 95 mph and instilling fear in opposition players.\n\nThe article mentions that Anrich Nortje is one of the favorites to top the leading wicket-takers in the tournament.",

Additionally, USA Cricket has not sanctioned the league either.\n\nMLC and MiLC are administered by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), which signed a 50-year commercial rights agreement with USA Cricket in 2019.\n\nICC expects US Cricket to resolve internal mess; may allot India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup game\n\nIt does, however, nudge the cricket body in USA to set their house in order before similar treatment is meted out to their 2024 T20 World Cup 2024 co-hosting plans.\n\nAt the ICC quarterly meeting earlier this month, USA Cricket bought time to resolve their internal mess by appointing an interim elected body to host matches for the marquee event next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“To think that a World Cup had been allotted here (ICC insists USA are ‘co-hosts’) is even more terrible to hear. Where’s the local cricket board? Where’s the infrastructure? Who are the people responsible for running the affairs here?,” said those in the knowing.\n\nUSA Cricket Interim CEO resigns\n\nEarlier this week, USAC Interim CEO Vinay Bhimjiani, who replaced Iain Higgins, resigned after just five months in the role. Search for Bhimjiani’s replacement is already underway with the chair sitting vacant for now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead | Start of T20 league in US with IPL investment likely to change cricketing ecosystem\n\n“The USA Cricket Board has confirmed that the USAC Interim CEO, Mr. Vinay Bhimjiani, has resigned effective immediately to pursue other personal opportunities. Mr. Bhimjiani served as Interim CEO for approximately 5 months,” USAC said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeed for structure\n\nEarly lessons after the MLC draft point towards a desperate need of order in USA Cricket. If the association wants to pull off something as big as the T20 World Cup and a possible India-Pakistan fixture, things need to head in the right direction and all stakeholders must align.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are continuous questions being raised on 2024 T20 World Cup fixtures being allotted to the USA – a region clearly underprepared - and the roadblocks which MLC is hitting right after the draft are not encouraging.\n\nAfter a Chief Executives Committee (CEC) meeting of the ICC on Saturday, it was decided that the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) will continue to remain primary hosts of the tournament and matches will be allotted to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement",

With over 2.5 billion fans worldwide, it’s the second most popular sport, falling closely behind soccer.\n\nThe sport has a long and complex history in the United States.\n\nCricket originated in the early 17th century in southeast England. It was played in 1833 at Haverford College, University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, and Columbia.\n\nWhile the sport didn’t take off well in the U.S., it was quickly adopted in countries like India, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.\n\nNow, some of the biggest investors in the U.S. are looking to bring professional cricket to the U.S., where there is an estimated 63 million fans.\n\nAfter a slow start due to COVID-19, Major League Cricket launched and is currently playing its inaugural season in July 2023.\n\nCricket is the Second Most Popular Sport in the World\n\nIn America, the NFL reigns supreme, and baseball is known as “America’s National Pastime”.\n\nHowever, globally, Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world, reaching 2.5 billion fans across 180 nations.\n\nIn India alone, there are about 1 billion fans and Cricket’s biggest stars have a huge reach on social media.\n\nFor reference, cricket star Virat Kohli has 256 million Instagram followers, which is more followers than some of America’s biggest athletes, including LeBron James, Tiger Woods, Patrick Mahomes, and more.\n\nAnd with many fans from other countries now residing in the States, the U.S. suddenly has a huge cricket market.

Fans traveled from all over the country like California, Florida, and New York to pack into a venue of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit to watch the match.\n\nThe atmosphere was said to be “electric”, as fans witness the beginning of Major League Cricket in the U.S.\n\nWith billions of fans around the world, the U.S.-based Cricket League has raised over $120 million in funding from some of the biggest executive techs, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen.\n\nBig things are happening for the league in the near future too.\n\nThe MLC is expected to play a shorter version of cricket called T20, which is supposed to produce more hits and scoring in just three hours.\n\nThere are also major stadium renovations happening in Texas and North Carolina. Meanwhile, Shah Rukh Khan, an MLC investor committed funds to build a 10,000-seat cricket stadium in Los Angeles.\n\nRecently, USA Cricket granted Major League Cricket the exclusive license to run a professional T20 league in the U.S.\n\nCricket Betting Guides 2024",

Pooran arrived at No.3 and set the stage on fire immediately.\n\nHe hit his second and third balls – the last two of the first over of the innings – for sixes.

He hit four more boundaries in the next two overs and reached his hundred in the 12th off just 40 balls.\n\nA chase that had looked difficult on paper when at the beginning was turned into a cakewalk.

    "date": "Fri May 26 15:56:18 2023",
    "body": "Jason Roy’s decision to cancel his England contract and sign up for Major League Cricket (MLC) has brought the sport’s attempt to crack the United States into sharp focus. But can the project really thrive in America? And what impact could it have on the English summer?\n\nThe six-team tournament in July has already attracted star names, with Roy joining his 2019 World Cup-winning teammate Liam Plunkett, South African superstar Quinton de Kock and Australians Aaron Finch and Marcus Stoinis in the US.\n\nIt has some powerful backers, too, and has had millions invested in it. Like many nascent Twenty20 leagues around the globe, this venture has the fingerprints of the Indian Premier League all over it. Four of the six teams are either owned or part-owned by IPL franchises. It follows IPL investment in the Caribbean Premier League, the South African T20 and International League T20 in the UAE.\n\nThe other two franchises have strategic partnerships with New South Wales Cricket and Cricket Victoria in Australia.\n\nThere are also powerful backers from the American business community, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Ross Perot Junior, son of the former US presidential candidate.\n\nWhy take cricket to America?\n\nWith an estimated 30 million cricket fans in the US, largely from expatriate communities, and the largest sports media market in the world, the attempt to crack America makes sense.\n\nMLC tournament director Justin Geale said earlier this year: “The opportunity here is huge. If we get the product right, I’m sure the growth and revenue will come through commercial opportunities, not just here in the US but also through broadcast in India where cricket revenue really is coming from.”\n\nHowever, MLC is unlikely to make much of a dent in the American market any time soon, particularly as it takes place at the height of the Major League Baseball season.\n\nIndeed, even those behind MLC have admitted they are unlikely to attract attention from uninitiated American fans for at least 10 to 15 years.\n\nIn the short term, it is the impact the league might have on other countries, particularly England, that will be telling.\n\nAlthough it doesn’t clash with either the T20 Blast regular season or the Hundred this year, that is unlikely to remain the case, particularly as the US is co-hosting next year’s Men’s T20 World Cup, meaning MLC is likely to be pushed later into the summer.\n\nHow much will players get paid?\n\nThe money is also attractive – Roy and other star overseas names will be paid £150,000-£200,000 for two weeks’ work, as opposed to the top-tier salary of £125,000 in the Hundred. Other England stars may well follow Roy in the coming years, which would damage the English domestic game.\n\nYet there are logistical issues, namely a lack of venues. The inaugural tournament will have most of its games played at one ground – the 7,500-capacity Grand Prairie stadium on the outskirts of Dallas. Church Street Park, a 3,500-\n\ncapacity venue in Morrisville, North Carolina, is also expected to host games. It’s hardly Madison Square Garden or Fenway Park.\n\nThis is the big leap MLC has to take, with team owners committing to build stadiums in their own cities from as early as 2025. “That’s a pretty big ask so these guys are serious,” says Geale.\n\nWhether or not cricket can realise its American dream is doubtful, but for now the hopes are high among those who have backed that dream with millions of dollars. Time will tell if it’s a reckless gamble or inspired investment.\n\nTeam-by-team guide\n\nMajor League Cricket will take place between 13-30 July, with 19 matches played\n\nMI New York\n\nBacked by: Mumbai Indians IPL franchise\n\nStar players: TBC (no overseas signings as yet).\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nBacked by: Kolkata Knight Riders IPL franchise\n\nStar players: Jason Roy, Nitish Kumar.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nBacked by: Delhi Capitals IPL franchise\n\nStar players: Quinton De Kock, Dasun Shanaka.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nBacked by: Chennai IPL franchise\n\nStar players: TBC.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nBacked by: New South Wales Cricket\n\nStar players: Anrich Nortje, Wanindu Hasaranga\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns",

Fourteen of the 51 overseas players who were spread across the MLC’s six teams featured at the World Cup, with the South African pair of Quinton De Kock (Seattle Orcas) and David Miller (Texas Super Kings) catching the eye with big performances.\n\nBut, to gratuitously mix sporting metaphors, the US will have much more skin in the game next summer, when it co-hosts the next World Cup, along with seven Caribbean islands. Around a third of the 55 games will be played in three American venues — one each in New York’s Nassau County, Florida’s Broward County and Dallas, Texas — and the US national team will get automatic qualification.\n\nThere will be an economic dividend, too. Cricket is the world’s second-most popular sport after soccer, which makes it highly attractive for international brands. Advertising around World Cups is an especially effective way for companies to connect with the vast Indian market: The nation of 1.4 billion people is famously cricket-mad. Each of the three American venues can also expect a boost in tourism, as fans follow their teams.\n\nIn case you’re wondering how there can be World Cups, which tend to be quadrennial, in consecutive years, this is as good a place as any to pause for an explanation. The sport is played in three formats, all of them governed by the International Cricket Council: “Test” cricket games are played over five days; “one-day international” contests, or ODIs, usually run to seven or eight hours each; and “T20” matches, the format chosen for the MLC, last roughly the duration of a baseball game. The recently concluded World Cup was for ODIs, the one coming up next June will be for the T20 version.\n\nBack to the point I was making: The T20 World Cup will again serve as a showcase for the MLC’s stars. More than that, it will also be a show window for international talent hoping to be snapped up by teams for the second season, which will be played shortly thereafter. “There’s already some buzz about the MLC among top players,” Tom Dunmore, the league’s head of marketing, tells me. “When they get a chance to experience cricket in America, more of them will want to join us.”\n\nMore stars will allow the MLC to expand its audience, at home and abroad, after a good first season: Dunmore says 92% of ticket capacity was sold out and games were broadcast in 87 countries.\n\nNext year’s World Cup will benefit American cricket more generally. In addition to giving homegrown cricketers exposure to top-level competition, it may also convert more Americans to the sport — doing for cricket what the 1994 FIFA World Cup did for soccer. “When you have the best in the world playing in your backyard and an international audience of hundreds of millions following closely, some of that excitement is bound to rub off,” Dunmore says.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure will help, too: A new cricket stadium will be built in Nassau County and the one in South Florida will be expanded. Oswego, Illinois, is reported to be planning a cricket stadium, too, even though it is not expected to be used for the World Cup.\n\nAnd as if to keep the momentum going, cricket will also feature in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. By then, the LA Knight Riders, co-owned by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, should have a purpose-built cricket stadium up and running.\n\nThis is all excellent news for the US national cricket team, currently ranked a respectable 22nd in the world. In addition to increased interest and investment in the sport, World Cups also provide inspiration. Arguably, the most remarkable performances in the tournament just concluded came from Afghanistan, which broke into the sport’s top tier less than a decade ago, with none of the advantages now accruing to American cricket. There’s no reason the US team can’t, to mix sports metaphors again, swing for the fences.\n\nRead also:\n\nRugby’s new coaching era: From referee to physio, unconventional paths reshape the game\n\nSaudi money is the last thing cricket needs – Adam Minter\n\nMeet Vince van der Bijl – cricket icon with a powerful message of hope for SA\n\n© 2023 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nVisited 1,395 times, 4 visit(s) today",

The tournament will be played between six teams, four out of which are either partly or fully owned by existing Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises.\n\nKolkata Knight Riders were one of the first investors in the tournament and own the Los Angeles-based team, while Mumbai Indians will be solely responsible for the New York-based franchise. Delhi Capitals meanwhile have joined hands with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and will co-own the Seattle-based franchise which will be called Seattle Orcas. The fourth IPL team to have a stake in the MLC is Chennai Super Kings, who will co-own the Texas-based franchise.\n\nThe remaining two teams – one based out of Washington DC and another out of San Franciso – are owned by local American investors in tie-ups with New South Wales Cricket and Victoria Cricket respectively.\n\nThe teams will create the domestic core of their squads today as the domestic player draft is set to take place at the Space Center Houston, the official Visitor Center of NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nFormat of the draft\n\nThere will be a total of nine rounds in the draft, with each team picking a player per round. The teams will follow a ‘snake order’ where the team which picks last in one particular round will pick first in the next.\n\nEach team will have to mandatorily pick a U-23 player in the ninth round, irrespective of whether they have picked one in earlier rounds or not.\n\nThe teams will get a shot at picking another U-23 domestic player in July, after the first half of the Minor League Cricket season, in a similar draft process. The overseas player signings will be done outside the draft process, with each team allowed a maximum of eight overseas players in their squad. The maximum squad strength is 18.\n\nTop players\n\nThere will be several international stars in the domestic player draft today (March 19), who have acquired local residencies. Two of the biggest names up for grabs will be World Cup winner Liam Plunkett, and seam-bowling all-rounder Corey Anderson. India U19 World Cup-winning captain Unmukt Chand will also be a part of the draft, along with his teammates from that squad Harmeet Singh and Smit Patel.\n\nMembers of the US national cricket team including the likes of Saurabh Netravalkar, Nosthush Kenjige, and Aaron Jones, will also be highly sought after in the draft. Saurabh has the best economy rate among pacers in two years of Minor League Cricket, Kenjige has an economy rate of 3.79 in the Cricket World Cup League 2 since 2020, and Jones had a 395-run season in Minor League Cricket (MiLC) last year at a strike rate of 151.\n\nSome of the other Minor League Cricket performers to keep an eye on include Hammad Azam, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of MiLC 2021, Phani Simhadri, the MVP of MiLC 2022, and Sujith Gowda, who has more than 1000 runs in the two seasons of the MiLC combined at a strike rate of nearly 150.\n\nTimings\n\nThe live broadcast of the draft will begin at 7:30pm local time (CST).

Feasibility studies for a development on a 14-acre site on the Santa Clara Fairgrounds in San José is currently underway in partnership with Santa Clara County. The stadium would seat up to 15,000 people and be capable of hosting major international cricket events.

They’ll be able to see it as a continuation of the contest between Chennai and Kolkata, two Indian cities that field similarly named franchises in the 15-year-old Indian Premier League (IPL). The Chennai Super Kings won the 2023 edition of the IPL.\n\nTwo other teams out of the six in the US league are owned by IPL franchises as well: the Seattle Orcas, an offshoot of the Delhi Capitals; and the awkwardly named Mumbai Indians New York, sprung from the Mumbai Indians. Many of the players in these teams are imports as well: globetrotting freelancers who have already plied their trade in the IPL.\n\nIs the US ready for cricket?\n\nTo rope the wealthy US market into world cricket has been something of a dream for cricketing authorities for decades. But the sport has suffered from the reputation that its rules are byzantine and its matches epically long—the longest version of it, after all, lasts five days. A game of T20 cricket, though, of the kind seen in the IPL and the MLC, operates along simpler rules and is roughly as long as the average baseball game. If there’s any kind of cricket that will lure Americans, T20 is likely to be it.\n\nBut MLC still feels like a transplant, not least because of where its players and team owners come from. More specifically, it feels like a tentacular expansion of the IPL, the world’s most lucrative sports championship after the National Football League.\n\nSince India’s national stars turn out in international fixtures for most of the year, the IPL only lasts two months. To keep the money rolling in, the owners of IPL teams—a Chennai-based cement giant, for example, or Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance conglomerate—started buying franchises overseas. All six teams in South Africa’s SA20 league are spinoffs of IPL teams, as are three out of the six teams in the United Arab Emirates’ International League.\n\nMajor League Cricket is too Indian to be a hit in the US\n\nThe MLC still has a few distinctly American elements. It functions as the big brother to Minor League Cricket, in which 26 teams are owned by local individuals or companies. The investors in the $120 million MLC include Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft and a noted cricket nut; Ross Perot Jr.; and several people of South Asian descent who have founded companies in the US.",

    "body": "With KKR already involved, four of the six teams in the new US-based T20 league, Major League Cricket, will have owners from the IPL\n\nNagraj Gollapudi\n\n16-Mar-2023\n\nThree prominent IPL franchises have bought stakes in Major League Cricket (MLC), a new T20 franchise league in the USA, which is scheduled to be launched this July. Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals, ESPNcricinfo has learned, have all bought stake in the MLC and will anchor franchises in New York, Texas and Seattle respectively.\n\nThat means four out of the six teams in MLC overall will be helmed by IPL franchises, after Kolkata Knight Riders, one of the earliest investors in the tournament, took charge of the Los Angeles franchise. While Mumbai, like Knight Riders, will run the New York franchise on its own, Capitals will run the Seattle franchise in partnership with Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella. While Capitals in the IPL is co-owned by the GMR Sports Private Ltd and Jindal Sports West, it is learned that it is the former that has entered into a partnership with Nadella to run the Seattle franchsie.\n\nIn a media release issued on Thursday, the MLC confirmed the alliance between Seattle franchise and Capitals, and said the team would be called Seattle Orcas. Other than Nadella and GMR, the other investors in the Orcas franchise comprise Soma Somasegar (managing director of Madrona Ventures), Samir Bodas (co-founder and CEO, Icertis), Ashok Krishnamurthi (managing partner, GreatPoint Ventures) and Sanjay Parthasarathy (former senior executive at Microsoft and Avalara).\n\nSuper Kings, too, have allied with a local investor in the Texas franchise.\n\nRelated\n\nMLC gets official ICC sanction ahead of July launch this year\n\nHales hopeful of featuring in MLC amid NOC doubts\n\nHarmeet Singh goes first in MLC Draft to Seattle Orcas; Ali Khan and Unmukt Chand snapped by LA Knight Riders\n\nMLC set to launch with draft on March 9 at NASA's Johnson Space Center\n\nMajor League Cricket set for July 2023 launch in Dallas\n\nThe two other franchises in the league are based out of Washington DC and San Francisco. The Washington DC franchise - to be called Washington Freedom - is owned by local American investor Sanjay Govil, who has tied up with New South Wales Cricket, to provide the operational expertise including helping set up the squad and putting a cricketing structure in place. A similar strategic tie-up has been struck between San Francisco franchise, owned by Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, and Cricket Victoria.\n\nThe development aligns with the constant endeavour of IPL franchises to expand their brands outside of India. All the four IPL franchises that have bought stakes in MLC are already part of more than one overseas domestic T20 franchise leagues. Outside of MLC, Mumbai own teams in South Africa's SA20 and the UAE-based International League T20 (ILT20), Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League and ILT20, Super Kings in SA20, and Capitals (GMR) in ILT20 and SA20.\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC will be played between July 13 and 30 at the newly renovated facility in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie, Texas, with the player draft for local US players scheduled to be on March 19 at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. The squad size will comprise minimum 15 and maximum 18 players, of which nine can be overseas players. At least six players in the playing XI will need to be from the USA. The overseas players will be direct signings by the franchises, not part of the draft.\n\nIt is understood that teams will have a purse of USD 800,000 for overseas signings and USD 300,000 for the US-based players.\n\nNagraj Gollapudi is news editor at ESPNcricinfo",

When the 20-year-old isn’t studying at the University of Texas at Dallas, he’s trading his backpack for a uniform to train as a professional cricket player.\n\nSheikh was drafted in March by the Los Angeles Knight Riders, one of Major League Cricket’s six teams. Next week, the burgeoning sports league will launch its inaugural season with a kick-off match in Grand Prairie.\n\nWhen Sheikh moved to North Texas in 2015, he said there weren’t many cricket athletes, coaches or facilities to speak of. But as time went on, more and more folks started to catch the cricket bug.\n\n“I feel like where it is today is what I never imagined, with the stadium being built and all the international players that are going to be coming to Dallas,” he told the Observer. “It's a great opportunity for people like me, that have been raised in the U.S., especially in Dallas. I feel like cricket itself was never expected to be this popular.”\n\nThese days, the country seems to have a serious thirst for less-traditional sports.\n\nThere’s pickleball, of course. That pastime boasts some 36.5 million U.S. participants and has seen an average growth rate of nearly 160% over the past three years, according to the website Pickleheads.\n\nBut American cricket is giving pickleball a run for its money. In the U.S., millions of dollars are being poured into the sport, which ranks No. 2 in popularity worldwide, just behind soccer — or as the rest of the world calls it, football. The baseball-esque bat-and-ball game is adored by some 2.5 billion fans around the globe, especially in Asia, the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nPlenty of big names are investing in MLC, too, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Ross Perot Jr., the Dallas real estate developer, UT Dallas noted in a news release.\n\nSheikh has big plans for when he graduates next year.\n\n“Once I get my undergrad degree, then I'll basically be full-time cricket and hopefully see how far that takes me,” he said. “And then, worst-case scenario — or at the end of my cricket career — I can always fall back into my accounting degree.”\n\nThat cricket career could take him overseas to play in far-flung places like Sri Lanka, Pakistan and the Caribbean, he said.\n\n“It's only going to grow from here on out.” – Ali Sheikh, Major League Cricket player\n\ntweet this\n\nSheikh, who was drafted in the MLC’s sixth round, is apparently quite good, too.\n\n“There was an ‘Under-23’ category, which is the ninth round, so every player that was under 23 got drafted in that round,” he said. “But I was the only one to get drafted in the first eight rounds that was under 23, so that was kind of cool.”\n\nSheikh started playing cricket in Qatar, where he was born and raised. In Dallas, he has benefited from the guidance of a coach who’s a former international player from Pakistan.\n\nThe UT Dallas student will now get the chance to play with some of the biggest names in cricket, some of whom he watched growing up.\n\n“It's a great opportunity for me and great exposure to be playing at the highest level,” Sheikh said. “I feel like there's a lot to learn from and a lot to take out of this experience.”\n\nOn top of the physical demands, cricket players need to have plenty of mental stamina. Sheikh estimates that cricket is up to 85% a mental game thanks to how much strategy is involved.\n\nMatches are intense and can last for several hours, he said, and there are plenty of emotions arising throughout.\n\nIn fact, one of the longest sporting events in history was a cricket match that lasted 43 hours over the span of 12 days, according to Discover Magazine.\n\nLooking ahead, Sheikh believes that the future of cricket in the U.S. is bright.\n\n“This is just the start, with the [Grand Prairie] stadium being built and all the international players moving here,” he said. “I feel like it's going to skyrocket, with all the money and investments … and interest being shown.\n\n“It's only going to grow from here on out.”\n\nCatch the Los Angeles Knight Riders’ match against the Dallas-based Texas Super Kings at Grand Prairie Stadium next Thursday, July 13.",

The latest in an increasingly long line of franchise T20 tournaments, this one in the USA… Here's everything you need to know about it (but didn't know whom to ask).\n\nWhat! Another T20 league? Aren't there some 50 of these already out there?\n\nYes, but wait. This could be different. Franchise cricket is going to the USA for the first time, after all.\n\nIn the USA? Why? Do they even play cricket there?\n\nOf course they do. And as far back as ... 1844! In fact USA was part of the first cricket match involving two countries (as opposed to clubs or other domestic clashes). That was against Canada, at the St George's Cricket Club ground in New York.\n\nMore recently, the USA men's team was at the ODI World Cup qualifier in Zimbabwe. They did not win a single game, but reaching the qualifiers is an achievement in itself.\n\nThey have talented players in the system and this league can help grow the game there. The timing of the event is significant too, since USA and West Indies will host the men's T20 World Cup around this time next year. And, being the hosts, USA (and West Indies) have gained automatic qualification to that tournament.\n\nOkay, you have my attention now. Tell me more...\n\nMLC has been in the works for a while and, after multiple delays, it will finally see the light of day on July 13. It is being operated by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) and has been sanctioned by USA Cricket. The ICC has also given official sanction for the league.\n\nACE is backed by Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, founders of Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America, and Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain of the Times Group in India. MLC has received financial backing to the tune of US$ 120 million from a number of investors, including Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, and Shantanu Narayen, chairman and CEO of Adobe.\n\nRelated\n\nKieron Pollard: 'A lot of people are sprinting through those franchise doors'\n\nCricket's American dream takes flight - 'This season is about proving we can do it'\n\nSteven Smith in contention for Major League Cricket action in 2024\n\nMLC doesn't want to 'start a war with anyone'\n\nIt will be a short, crisp 19-game tournament - at least in the first season - with the first game on July 13 (July 14 in India, at 6am IST) and the final on July 30 (July 31 in India, at 6am IST).\n\nIn all, there will be 15 group-stage games followed by an eliminator, two qualifiers and the final. Six teams are in action and will start with a round-robin format, with the top four advancing to the playoffs. The format is similar to what they have at the IPL, but the teams will face each other only once in the league phase. Here's the full list of fixtures.\n\nSix teams, you say. Those are...?\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom.\n\nWhoa, hold on! Knight Riders, Super Kings, MI… sounds familiar.\n\nFour of the six teams are owned by IPL franchise owners.\n\nYou can tell who owns LA Knight Riders, MI Knight Riders and Texas Super Kings, right? And Seattle Orcas are owned by the GMR Group, who co-own Delhi Capitals. These groups own teams in other T20 leagues too, of course. And this raises the stakes even more.\n\nWashington Freedom are owned by Indian-American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil, and will have Cricket New South Wales as a high-performance partner. San Francisco Unicorns are owned by Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, and they have partnered with Cricket Victoria for their first season. It's all pretty serious business, as you can tell.\n\nAnd these matches will be played in?\n\nTwo venues. The first eight league games will be held at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas before the teams move to Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville for the next seven outings. The playoffs will be staged at Grand Prairie again.\n\nNever heard of these stadiums. Anything more on them?\n\nThe Grand Prairie is a former baseball park, and was redeveloped into a cricket stadium in 2022. The new stadium has a capacity of close to 7000. The other venue, Church Street Park, is in Morrisville, North Carolina, and has a capacity of around 3500, which can be expanded up to 5000.\n\nNothing in Fort Lauderdale? That's where they play international cricket, isn't it?\n\nYes, true, but two of the T20Is on India's tour of the Caribbean are being played there in August. So...\n\nBut will people come to watch?\n\nWe can only know once the games begin, but MLC recently announced that the tickets for the opening fixture between Texas and Los Angeles have been sold out. South Asian and Caribbean expats make up most of the cricket community there, and much of the USA national team, too. You'd expect them to come to watch.\n\nTickets can be bought from the MLC website.\n\nAnd where can we watch the games if not at the ground?\n\nIn the USA and Canada, it's on Willow TV. In India, it will be on Sports18 and Jio. If you are in Australia, MLC will be on Fox, SportsMax in the Caribbean, SKY NZ in New Zealand, A Sports in Pakistan, SuperSport in South Africa and BT Sport in the UK.\n\nWho are the big players in action?\n\nLos Angles have Jason Roy, Sunil Narine and Andre Russell. New York have Rashid Khan, Trent Boult and Kieron Pollard. San Francisco have Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis and Corey Anderson. Texas have Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway and David Miller. Seattle have Quinton de Kock, Shimron Hetmyer, Imad Wasim and Sikandar Raza. And Washington have Anrich Nortje and Marco Jansen.\n\nImpressive, eh? The full squads are here.\n\nCan they field as many overseas players as they want, or is there a cap?\n\nEach side can have a maximum of 19 and a minimum of 16 players on their roster. A maximum of nine international players are allowed in the squads. Each squad needs to have at least one USA Under-23 player, and must have at least ten domestic players, which is being done to give the next generation of American talents a chance to rub shoulders with the best.\n\nThe final playing XIs can have a maximum of six overseas players and five domestic players.\n\nSweet. How were the players drafted?\n\nThe domestic players were signed via a player draft, which was held at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston on March 19. Harmeet Singh, who was part of India's 2012 Under-19 World Cup-winning side, was the first pick, snapped up by Seattle. Steven Taylor was the first American-born player picked in the draft, by New York, while another former India U-19 start Unmukt Chand, who is in the USA now, went to Los Angeles.\n\nYou can read all about how the player draft went.\n\nAny other Indian players?\n\nApart from Chand and Harmeet, we have Chaitanya Bishnoi, Tajinder Singh, Shubham Ranjane and Smit Patel. All of these players have retired from the Indian domestic circuit. Ambati Rayudu was also slated to take part but withdrew in the wake of the BCCI's proposal to introduce a year-long cooling-off period for retired players before they can participate in overseas T20 leagues.\n\nThat's a bummer. Do we know the captains?\n\nYep, we do. Texas: Faf du Plessis. Los Angeles: Sunil Narine. Seattle: Wayne Parnell. New York: Kieron Pollard. San Francisco: Aaron Finch. Washington: Moises Henriques.\n\nLastly, these games will have T20 status?\n\nNo. While they are being played in the T20 format, the records will not reflect in the players' profiles because the USA - like the UAE, where the ILT20 is held - is not a Full-Member nation.\n\nAshish Pant is a sub-editor with ESPNcricinfo",
    "summary": "**Overview:** The MLC is a new franchise T20 cricket tournament to be held in the USA, starting on July 13.\n\n**Background:** The tournament is operated by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) and sanctioned by USA Cricket and the ICC.

    "body": "USA’s Major League Cricket (MLC) has offered annual professional contracts to 11 USA national team players and rookie contracts to six other youth players.\n\nUSA’s MLC Offered Annual Professional Contracts\n\nIt is learnt that most of the players were offered the contracts during the recently concluded MLC Houston Challenge, a curtain-raiser for the American cricket summer that saw 3 MLC and a representative USA national side taking on one another in a series of practice games.\n\nIt is understood that USA selectors had given a list of 22 players that are part of USA’s scheme of things going forward and after much deliberation, MLC pruned down the list further.\n\nUSA’s batting mainstays captain Monank Patel and vice-captain Aaron Jones duly made the cut along with senior batsmen Steven Taylor, Jaskaran Malhotra and Gajanand Singh. Former captain Saurabh Netravalkar, Rusty Theron, Marty Kain and Ali Khan, who came back to USA fold last year after a brief hiatus from the national team, have also been made an offer.\n\nIan Holland, who is expected to spend most of the American summer playing for Hampshire, and Cameron Stevenson, who last played for USA in February 2020, have also made the cut.\n\nSalary for the Players\n\nThe youth contracts offered by MLC are another step up to their extensive investment in youth cricketing ecosystems.\n\nThe investment into housing professional players as mentors into yourth academies, national coaching clinics and fast-tracking of players into their respective minor league sides is now reaping rewards with the ongoing success of players like Sai Teja Mukkamalla, Under-19 captain Ali Sheikh, Rahul Jariwala, Vatsal Vaghela and Sanjay Krishnamurthy. The youth contracts are understood to be in excess of $10,000.\n\nThe report states that these professional contracts that have been offered range from $55,000 to $40,000 per year, a far cry from the $24,000 annual fee currently paid by US cricket.\n\nAmerican cricketers have been held back on these meager deductions since the start of covid, having been subjected to pay cuts of more than 50%, players turned to semi-professionals and were forced to seek employment other jobs while the council’s administrative payroll has seen a climb up.\n\n“This is a robust step towards ensuring a pool of USA qualified players are professionally contracted and available for national team duties.\n\nMLC intends to assist these players with their professional development through access to infrastructure, exposure to high-quality tournaments and training environments, and a support structure that consists of advisors, talent representation, specialist coaches, physios etc.\n\nThis improves the quality of domestic players available for Major League Cricket’s inaugural season in 2023, and keeps the USA on track to field a very competitive team in the 2024 World Cup” said Mehta.\n\nHow Can a Player Acquire MLC contracts?\n\nMLC contracts will require players to attend semi-professional MLC minor league cricket T20 and two other MLC-recognized T20 pop-up national events. Although these contracts do not involve playing the first MLC T20 in 2023, MLC’s Sameer Mehta believes it is a step in the right direction to develop and condition players for the rigors of professional cricket that await them.",

    "body": "When Sanjay Parthasarathy left his last tech job in February 2023, he figured he’d do what he could to help get the first season of Major League Cricket up and running in the Seattle area and at the national level. After that, it would probably be time to go find another “real job,” as he put it.\n\nJust over a year later, Parthasarathy, one of several notable names from the region’s tech industry who are backing the Seattle Orcas, is beyond just getting things off the ground. He’s become fully immersed in the business of the sport he once played as a professional.\n\n“I’ve done a startup. It was 10x a startup kind of pace and velocity,” Parthasarathy said of the inaugural season for the league and the Orcas. “I’ve played cricket my entire life. Running a team — that was something else.”\n\nThe Orcas lead investor group includes Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Madrona Venture Group Managing Director S. Soma Somasegar; Icertis co-founder and CEO Samir Bodas; and GreatPoint Ventures managing partner Ashok Krishnamurthi. Indian conglomerate GMR Group also has a stake.\n\nParthasarathy was a longtime Microsoft executive before founding and leading Indix in 2012. The AI and machine learning startup was acquired by tax software giant Avalara in 2019, which was in turn acquired by Vista Equity Partners in 2022. Parthasarathy stepped down from his role as Avalara’s chief product officer last year.\n\nIn retrospect, the 2023 cricket season went much better than he and others expected. Parthasarathy said the effort probably accelerated cricket in the U.S. by two or three years. Not bad, considering the goal was “just to survive the season.”\n\nMLC and its six teams — Seattle, Texas, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. — attracted fan and broadcast interest. And the Orcas finished as runners up in the short season of Twenty20 cricket that wrapped up outside Dallas last July.\n\nThere are several goals this season and none seem to faze Parthasarathy’s enthusiasm for what’s possible. Those goals include:\n\nMake the Orcas ‘America’s favorite cricket team’\n\nParthasarathy said the Orcas decided from the start to be loud, different, and fun.\n\nThe team boasts a core group of fans from around the Seattle area, including many Asian Indians from the tech community. But as the smallest of the six MLC markets, the Orcas want to grow their base by attracting fans in cities across the U.S.\n\nA redesign of the team’s original, quickly conceived logo added a cricket bat and crown (for King County) to the playful orca mascot. Fans took notice last summer, and Orcas merchandise was a hit.\n\n“Every adult has their favorite team, but if you look at all the kids in the stadiums, they all have Seattle Orcas [jerseys],” Parthasarathy said. “That’s who we need to reach out to as a team.”\n\nBroaden the fan base\n\n“We have product market fit — just to use a traditional startup term — with the core audience,” Parthasarathy said, referencing 30- to 40-year-old males tied to what he calls “the Commonwealth diaspora” — India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand and England.\n\nTo reach a broader base of U.S. fans used to professional baseball, football, basketball and more, it’s about getting cricket in front of people.\n\n“If people are aware of it and they actually go watch, they’ll get hooked,” he said. “Is that going to take three years, seven years, 10 years? Probably. We’ve got to do out-of-the-box things to attract attention and just be different. Because if people watch it, they’ll enjoy it.”\n\nGrow the sport at grassroots level\n\nReferencing the popularity of the NBA, and basketball in general, Parthasarathy said there are pickup games in gyms, parks and home courts all around the country.\n\n“We don’t have enough pickup games in cricket,” he said. “If you go to India, there’s pickup cricket going all the time, everywhere. How do we get from here to there? I call that grassroots development. … It doesn’t take much to get started. Don’t worry about the rules. Don’t worry about the technicalities. Just start to play. It’s see ball, hit ball, right? That’s where it starts.”\n\nPrepare U.S. for strong showing at 2028 Olympics\n\nEven though it’s regarded as the second-most-popular sport in the world (behind soccer), cricket last appeared at the Olympics in 1900, at the Paris Games. In October, the International Olympic Committee approved the addition of the sport for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, and Parthasarathy called it a pivotal development, especially on the heels of the U.S. hosting matches for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.\n\n“How do we get from Major League Cricket to the Olympics? That’s the journey that is most interesting, because you’ve got to get grassroots awareness and you’ve got to get the domestic team playing at a reasonable level,” Parthasarathy said.\n\nContinue work on bringing a cricket ground to Seattle area\n\nTwo years ago, the King County Council passed a motion of support for the development of a cricket grounds at Marymoor Park in Redmond. Parthasarathy said discussions between MLC and the county and cities involved are ongoing.\n\n“If we take a phased approach, we’re hoping we can get games going in this area in 2025,” he said. “But a lot of stars have to align to make that happen.”\n\nMLC and the Orcas ownership group wants the grounds to be a community resource.\n\n“This is not just going to be like the traditional approaches that we have with baseball stadiums and football stadiums,” Parthasarathy said. “There’s a lot more nuances and benefits to both sides that need to be worked out.”",
    "summary": "* The MLC had a successful inaugural season in 2023, with six teams, including the Seattle Orcas, which finished as runners-up in the Twenty20 cricket tournament.\n* The Orcas are led by a group of investors from the tech industry, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and others.\n* Sanjay Parthasarathy, one of the investors, has become immersed in the business of cricket and aims to grow the sport in the US.\n* The goals for the next season include making the Orcas \"America's favorite cricket team\", broadening the fan base, growing the sport at the grassroots level, and preparing the US for a strong showing at the 2028 Olympics, where cricket will be included for the first time since 1900.\n* The Orcas want to attract fans across the US, grow their merchandise sales, and increase awareness of the sport.\n* Parthasarathy also aims to establish a cricket ground in the Seattle area, with discussions ongoing with the county and cities involved.",

    "body": "American cricket finds serious backers\n\nIn a historic first for cricket lovers in the U.S., Grand Prairie, Texas, and Morrisville, North Carolina, will host the inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC) starting July 13. Backed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Indian Premier League franchises, and desi tech heavyweights like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the tournament is expected to create the right kind of buzz for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, 2024, to be hosted by the United States and the West Indies.\n\nUSA Cricket set the ball rolling for the MLC a few years back by creating Minor League Cricket, which had its inaugural season in 2021. Many of the top performers in the minor league have found spots on MLC teams. This is the game-changing opportunity American cricket enthusiasts have been waiting for: each team has to field at least six domestic players in its playing 11.\n\nHowever, as an aspiring American cricketer myself, I was disappointed to see that not many truly homegrown domestic players have been selected. Noteworthy players like Rahul Jariwala and Vatsal Vaghela have been left out. Both of them received USA Cricket’s Emerging Player Scholarship but failed to make it on a team. Jariwala and Vaghela played in the Minor League tournament and made significant contributions to their teams.\n\nEven so, there’s much to celebrate, as the tournament is a giant leap for American cricket.\n\nSix teams from across the U.S. to battle it out\n\nThere are six teams across the United States: Washington Freedom, Texas Super Kings, MI New York, LA Knight Riders, Seattle Orcas, and the San Francisco Unicorns. Among these teams, the Texas Super Kings, MI New York, and the LA Knight Riders are owned by IPL franchises. The IPL is the world’s second-richest sports league, bested only by the NFL.\n\nWhile the games this season will be split between Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park, in Morrisville, North Carolina, each team is expected to have its own home stadium in the future.\n\nThere will be 19 group-stage matches, and the top four teams will make it to the playoffs. Much like the IPL format, the top teams will play an eliminator, qualifier, challenger, and then the final match to decide the winner of the tournament.\n\nTeams USA\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nFaf du Plessis (Captain), Milind Kumar, Sami Aslam, Cody Chetty, Saiteja Mukkamalla, David Miller, Devon Conway, Calvin Savage, Zia Shahzad, Dwayne Bravo, Daniel Sams, Mitchell Santner, Lahiru Milantha, Rusty Theron, Cameron Stevenson, Gerald Coetzee\n\nTSK has put together a good team, with many former and current IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings players.\n\nBatting: They have one of the strongest opening partnerships, with Faf du Plessis and Devon Conway. David Miller, a phenomenal finisher who is in amazing form is also on the roster.\n\nBowling: On the bowling front, they have a few bowling all-rounders, such as Rusty Theron, Cameron Stevenson, and Calvin Savage. They also have CSK’s own Dwayne Bravo, and the young Gerald Coetzee.\n\nDomestic talent: With their U19 selection in the draft, they picked Saiteja Mukkamalla. He is a great player, and has wonderful technique and timing, but might struggle with his strike rate. They also have Milind Kumar and Lahiru Milantha, who are both good domestic batters.\n\nWeak link: One area that might be lacking is their spin bowling department. Besides Mitchell Santner, they only have Zia Shahzad, a wrist spinner.\n\nX-factor: Daniel Sams. Sams is a good fast bowler, and can also bat. TSK will be hoping that he can execute both of these abilities.\n\nMI New York\n\nKieron Pollard (Captain), Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir, Tim David, David Wiese, Dewald Brevis, Monank Patel, Saideep Ganesh, Nicholas Pooran, Kyle Philip, Ehsan Adil, Nosthush Kenjige, Sarbjit Ladda, Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Jason Behrendorff, Rashid Khan\n\nMI New York has a star-studded team.\n\nBatting: This team has some of the best finishers in world cricket in Nicholas Pooran, Tim David, and Kieron Pollard.\n\nBowling: An amazing fast bowling lineup that includes Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult, and Jason Behrendorff. They also have Rashid Khan, the best spinner in international cricket.\n\nDomestic Talent: They have the USA captain, Monank Patel, and Steven Taylor, who is arguably the best batter on Team USA and an aggressive left-hander.\n\nWeak Link: Their top order – they will have to rely on their domestic players to perform.\n\nX-factor: Twenty-year-old Dewald Brevis Brevis has been nicknamed Baby AB for his 360-degree shots.\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nWayne Parnell (Captain), Shehan Jayasuriya, Aaron Jones, Nauman Anwar, Angelo Perera, Harmeet Singh, Shubham Ranjane, Cameron Gannon, Mitchell Marsh, Dasun Shanaka, Sikandar Raza, Quinton de Kock, Phani Simhadri, Matthew Tromp, Andrew Tye\n\nThe Orcas have built a very balanced team.\n\nBatting: Their overseas talent includes Quinton de Kock and Mitchell Marsh, both of whom are among the most powerful players in world cricket. Sri Lankan captain, Dasun Shanaka, brings his vast experience to the Orcas. Sikandar Raza picked up the 4th highest number of wickets and scored the 5th highest number of runs in the 2022 T20 World Cup.\n\nBowling: Marsh, Shanaka, and Raza, are all batters with terrific bowling talent, giving the Orcas a good amount of flexibility.\n\nDomestic Talent: Shehan Jayasuriya and Aaron Jones are both US domestic batters with international experience.\n\nWeak Link: They don’t have enough specialist bowlers, which might hold them back.\n\nX-factor: Shehan Jayasuriya. The Orcas will be hoping that Jayasuriya will bring his excellent form in Minor League Cricket to MCL this season.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nAaron Finch (Captain), Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, Qais Ahmed, Finn Allen, Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Lungi Ngidi, Corey Anderson, Chaitanya Bishnoi, Brody Couch, Sanjay Krishnamurti, Carmi Leroux, Smit Patel, Liam Plunkett, Tajinder Singh, David White\n\nThe Unicorns went for veteran players in the draft.\n\nBatting: With their overseas selections, they chose to build a strong top order, with Aaron Finch, Matthew Wade, and Marcus Stoinis.\n\nBowling: The Unicorns have a strong bowling attack, including Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Lungi Ngidi, and Qais Ahmed. Veteran Liam Plunkett joins them as well.\n\nDomestic Players: With their U19 selection, the Unicorns picked Sanjay Krishnamurti, who bowls left-arm orthodox, and can also bat.\n\nWeak Link: The team lacks finishers. They might have to shuffle their batting order around to use either Stoinis or Wade as a finishing option.\n\nX-factor: Corey Anderson. At the peak of his powers, Anderson was a scary batter, and a good bowler. If Anderson can return to form, the Unicorns will be an improved team.\n\nLA Knight Riders\n\nSunil Narine (Captain), Jaskaran Malhotra, Jason Roy, Martin Guptill, Nitish Kumar, Rilee Rossouw, Saif Badar, Unmukt Chand, Ali Sheikh, Andre Russell, Bhaskar Yadram, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Adam Zampa, Ali Khan, Corne Dry, Lockie Ferguson\n\nThe Knights signed many Kolkata Knight Riders players, including Andre Russell, and Sunil Narine.\n\nBatting: The Knights team has a very strong batting attack, with plenty of options at their disposal. The ones to look out for are Jason Roy, Martin Guptill (New Zealand), and Rilee Rossouw from South Africa.\n\nBowling: Lockie Ferguson is a threatening pacer, and is currently one of the fastest in the world. Adam Zampa is a fantastic spinner.\n\nDomestic talent: Ali Khan and Shadley van Schalkwyk are both fast bowlers with experience playing against top-tier talent.\n\nX-factor: Ali Sheikh. This is one of my favorite picks. He has been on selectors’ radars for a while now and was the earliest U19 selection in the draft. Sheikh has huge potential and is the best homegrown player from the US. In U19 cricket, he scored a century in 60 balls and piled up a ton of runs in youth cricket. He can also bowl a handy left-arm orthodox, which should be helpful for the Knight Riders.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nMoises Henriques (Captain), Mukhtar Ahmed, Saad Ali, Sujith Gowda, Jacobus Pienaar, Justin Dill, Anrich Nortje, Saurabh Netravalkar, Dane Piedt, Marco Jansen, Akhilesh Bodugum, Adam Milne, Ben Dwarshuis, Akeal Hosein, Andries Gous, Glenn Phillips, Josh Philippe\n\nBatting: The team has some fearless players such as Glenn Phillips. Josh Philippe, an opening batsman-keeper, has scored many runs in Australia’s Big Bash League. Moises Henriques is also a powerful addition to their team.\n\nBowling: The Washington Freedom has some of the fastest bowlers currently in world cricket. Anrich Nortje, Adam Milne, and Marco Jansen can hit speeds as high as 155 kilometers per hour. Akeal Hosein heads their spinners. Hosein is a crafty bowler and does not give away too many runs.\n\nDomestic players: Their most notable picks were Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar. Gous is an attacking batter and has played in overseas leagues such as the Abu Dhabi T20 competition. Netravalkar is a left-arm pacer who gets awesome swings when he bowls with the new ball.\n\nWeak link: Spin bowling. Other than Akeal Hosein, the only player with real international experience is Dane Piedt.\n\nX-factor: Saurabh Netravalkar. Netravalkar has shown that he can stand up to top talent.\n\nAdi’s Crystal Ball Rankings\n\nMI New York\n\nSeattle Orcas\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nLA Knight Riders\n\nChampion: MI New York\n\nWho’s your favorite team?",

    "title": "With its own Major League, cricket looks for a foothold in the United States",
    "date": "Wed Jul 12 07:46:39 2023",
    "body": "George Bernard Shaw asserted “the English are not very spiritual people so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.”\n\nIt has been a long game, traditionally.\n\nWhile cricket has flourished in England and some of its former colonies, it has never taken off to the same degree in the United States, where some have perceived it as impenetrable.\n\nA sport played in its purist form by players in long white uniforms, test cricket goes on for five days and still often ends with no winner, with days so long players twice have to leave the field for meals.\n\nMajor League Cricket, which begins on Thursday, could change that perception. For a start, the games only go for just over three hours.\n\nMLC will comprise six teams, from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, New York and Washington, which will play a competition of 18 matches before the first final on July 30.\n\nTeams will have a maximum of 19 and minimum of 16 players, combining international stars and home-grown players selected through a draft which was made when the league was launched, officially and metaphorically, at Space Center Houston. Each team was allowed to sign nine local players, one of which had to be under-23.\n\nThe salaries of international players will be drawn from an initial $120 million investment from corporate backers, mainly from India.\n\nThe teams will play Twenty20 style which might be portrayed as cricket with the dull bits removed. The format may be more appealing to the American sport palate because there is always a winner: if the teams are still tied after both innings — each comprising 20 six-ball overs — a tie-breaking “super over” is played to find the winner.\n\nMost matches will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, converted to a cricket stadium with 7,200 seats and a grass pitch. Other matches will be played at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThe league follows the model of professional Twenty20 — or more broadly known as T20 — leagues which already exist in places such as India, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Canada. They’re all supported by a travelling troupe of international players — many of them T20 specialists — who give leagues marquee quality.\n\nThe most lucrative and glamorous of all these franchise competitions is the Indian Premier League, where the world’s best players are hired by teams owned by Bollywood stars, business giants and other celebrities. The gravitational pull of the IPL has reshaped cricket’s traditional schedules and made many new cricketing millionaires.\n\nMajor League Cricket inevitably will have some of the Indian Premier League glitz. Four of the six teams are owned and will be run by IPL franchises.\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders will be run by the Knight Riders Group which operate the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. MI New York will be run by the Mumbai Indians, Texas Super Kings and the Seattle Orcas by the GMR Group which runs the Delhi Capitals.\n\nTwo of Australia’s provincial organizations — Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales — will run the San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom respectively.\n\nMany of the biggest stars from India, Australia and England are involved in test series — more of those five-day matches — but MLC has attracted a strong contingent of seasoned T20 performers.\n\nBollywood star Shah Rukh Khan co-owns the Knight Riders Group and has recruited West Indies stars Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, England’s Jason Roy, South Africa’s Rilee Rossouw, Australian Adam Zampa and New Zealanders Lockie Ferguson and Martin Guptill.\n\n“We have assembled a strong and talented team for the debut season of MLC who can compete at the highest level and bring joy to cricket fans around the world,” Knight Riders Group chief executive Venky Mysore said.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have hired South Africa’s Faf du Plessis as captain alongside international stars Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, David Miller, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee.\n\nChennai Super Kings chief executive K.S. Viswanathan said du Plessis “led the Joburg Super Kings at (the South African T20 league) from the front earlier this year and we’re confident of doing well under him in Texas.”\n\nThe West Indies and Mumbai Indians star Kieron Pollard will captain New York, which will have Robin Peterson as head coach and Lasith Malinga as bowling coach. Their signings include fast bowlers Trent Boult from New Zealand and Kagiso Rabada from South Africa.\n\nSeattle has Australian star Mitch Marsh and South Africa’s Quinton de Kock.\n\nMLC has broader ambitions, to build minor leagues in a bid to develop training and development facilities and support the U.S. national team.\n\nNow it remains to be seen whether American fans will find Major League Cricket to their taste and make the league itself everlasting.\n\n___",

The first game is the one that will set the tone for the rest of the season. Now imagine that this first game is the first event for the whole league, and there's a sold-out crowd. The pressure has to be tremendous.\n\n\"There's always a bit of pressure on the first game, but it's something I believe is gonna create something for the future, and to be a part of that I think firstly is very special as the team to play the opening game,\" David Miller of the Texas Super Kings says. \"It's special and a privileged position to be in, so to notch off a win as well is even better.\"\n\nThe Texas Super Kings faced that scenario on Thursday at the new cricket oval in Grand Prairie for its season-opening, 69-run win against the Los Angeles Knight Riders. The fans who filled the former home of the Texas AirHogs baseball team to capacity on Thursday will have 10 more chances to root for the home team now that the first official Major League Cricket (MLC) season is underway. According to the league, six of those games are sold out already.\n\n“The passion and excitement seen in the stands on the sold-out opening night of Major League Cricket on Thursday was amazing to behold,\" said MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan, \"and we can’t wait to see more full houses signaling the arrival of a new top-tier professional sports league in America.\"\n\nIf you're the kind of football-worshipping Texan who laughed at the initial idea of a professional cricket team in our backyard, you'd have to a hard time hanging on to that argument if you went to Thursday night's match. The stands were packed and decorated with yellow flags carrying the Super Kings lion logo as fans raised some hell to support their team on the pitch. These fans are invested in their teams and in the game, making for some dramatic tension and inspired celebrations. There were some lulls in the action in between bowls and bats — just like in baseball, where it can feel like an eternity waiting for a big hit or the chance to see a killer play. But it's different with cricket. You really have to zone in on every second because a hit wicket or a great catch can happen at just about any moment, and if your head isn't pointed toward the field, it's easy to miss.\n\nLate in the game, bowler Gerald Coetzee caught the Knight Riders off guard with a superb hit wicket in a matter of a second. The wicket and the poles lit up like fireworks as the wicket launched to the other end of the oval and the crowd roared. It was followed with fireworks that punctuated the achievement. If my head was turned in the other direction, there was no chance to catch it in action. Cricket demands your attention, and you can get lost in the action.\n\nEven the defensive plays are a thrill to watch. There are so many areas the fielders have to cover, so diving saves and sliding catches happen a lot more than just maybe once or twice a game.\n\nCricket definitely has a future in Texas. Just imagine how it would feel to have a championship team back in Dallas once again.",

    "date": "Sat Jun 17 20:38:49 2023",
    "body": "Even before its inauguration, the Major League Cricket (MLC) has already sparked a ripple effect in international cricket. It happens to be a T20I cricket league that will be played in the United States of America from 13 July. A total of 6 teams will be playing in the league that has been sanctioned by USA Cricket and will be operated by American Cricket Enterprise.\n\nMatches will be held in Texas’ Prairie Grand Stadium and North Carolina’s Church Street Park. With the inaugural champions to be crowned on 13 July, MLC is seen as a great attempt to increase the popularity of cricket in America, where the sport has perhaps not made significant inroads yet.\n\nHere's all you need to know about the MLC:\n\nMany IPL teams are actively trying to broaden their horizons, with sister franchises in overseas leagues. Following the trend seen in the Caribbean Premier League, SA20 and also the International League T20, MLC is also set to be an IPL-dominated event, in terms of the franchise spread.\n\nChennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals (only GMR group) and Kolkata Knight Riders have all purchased teams in the MLC. Texas Super Kings will be seen representing IPL’s MS Dhoni-led five-time winners, Chennai, with another five-time champion, Mumbai Indians buying the New York franchise.\n\nMany renowned international players will be making appearances in MLC 2023, which promises to be an enthralling competition, according to the teams’ rosters. T20I cricket’s biggest superstars in Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Andre Russell, Quinton De Kock, Mitchell Marsh, Anrich Nortje, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Wanindu Hasaranga will be seen in action.\n\nWhile de Kock and Marsh will be seen in action for Seattle Orcas, Anrich Nortje and Wanindu Hasaranga will ply their trades for Washington Freedom. The Caribbean pair of Russell and Narine will represent the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nMLC will be held from 13 July to 30 July. The league will be held in two legs, with the first one, containing 8 league matches, to be held in Texas’ Grand Prairie Stadium, and the second one to take place at North Carolina’s Church Street Park.\n\nSalary caps for players picked in each round were fixed during the MLC draft. The players drafted in the first round have been acquired for $75,000, while the amount spent for the players drafted in the second, third and fourth rounds are $65,000, $50,000 and $40.000 respectively. The fifth, sixth and seventh and eighth rounds had a fixed salary cap of $35,000, $25,000, $15,000 and $10,000 respectively. The players bought during the ninth round, which was also the last round of the draft, were acquired for $2,500.\n\nEnglish opener Jason Roy, who also plays for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL, recently decided to terminate his incremental contract with the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB), in favour of a deal with the Los Angeles Knight Riders in MLC. This move has the potential to trigger a butterfly effect in international cricket, with many fearing players might choose franchise deals over national contracts, with many IPL franchises like the Knight Riders having teams across the globe, playing in multiple competitions.\n\nICC is also planning on imposing a new rule to restrict the participation of overseas cricketers. According to ESPNCricinfo, the new rule might make it mandatory for franchises to field a maximum of only four overseas players in the playing XI, which could have a dampening effect on MLC’s hype, considering the current laws allow each team to have six overseas stars in the playing XI.",
    "summary": "**Overview**\n\n* The MLC is a T20I cricket league that will be played in the United States of America from July 13 to July 30.\n* The league will feature 6 teams and will be operated by American Cricket Enterprise, sanctioned by USA Cricket.\n\n**Teams and Franchises**\n\n* IPL teams have purchased franchises in the MLC, including Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals, and Kolkata Knight Riders.\n* Teams will be based in Texas, North Carolina, Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles.\n\n**Players**\n\n* Renowned international players like Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Andre Russell, Quinton De Kock, Mitchell Marsh, Anrich Nortje, Sunil Narine, and Wanindu Hasaranga will participate in the tournament.\n* Players will represent their respective teams, with some notable pairings including De Kock and Marsh for Seattle Orcas, and Russell and Narine for Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n**Schedule and Venues**\n\n* The league will be held in two legs, with the first leg taking place at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and the second leg at Church Street Park in North Carolina.\n* The tournament will run from July 13 to July 30, with the inaugural champions to be crowned on July 13.\n\n**Salary Caps**\n\n* Salary caps for players picked in each round of the MLC draft were fixed, ranging from $75,000 for first-round picks to $2,500 for ninth-round picks.\n\n**Implications**\n\n* The MLC has the potential to increase the popularity of cricket in America, where the sport has not yet gained significant traction.\n* The league's format and player participation may have implications for international cricket, with some fearing that players may choose franchise deals over national contracts.",

    "title": "Ben Stokes remains ‘100 per cent committed’ to England, says Rob Key",
    "date": "Tue Oct 24 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "England are confident Ben Stokes remains “100 per cent committed” to international cricket, despite turning down a three-year central contract in favour of a 12-month extension.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board has introduced multi-year deals for the first time in a bid to guard against the growing influence of franchise leagues but Test captain Stokes has rejected an offer that would have tied him in until autumn 2026.\n\nInstead of taking the long-term security of an offer that would have been worth in the region of £3million – no small matter given his fitness issues in recent times – he has agreed another annual retainer and plans to renegotiate again next year.\n\nDirector of men’s cricket Rob Key, who has overseen the revamped system, is relaxed about the decision and believes Stokes is merely gambling on raising his future value at the bargaining table.\n\n“Ben was offered three, but he’s actually turned around now and said: ‘No, I think I’ll be in a stronger position next year’,” explained Key.\n\n“You might have more power if you have a good year to negotiate what you want. But he’s 100 per cent committed to playing for England, so I wouldn’t read into it the fact he signed one year that he’s not.\n\n“By no means is it Ben Stokes saying: ‘I don’t want to play for England’. All he talks about is being completely committed to playing for England and also captaining that Test team – planning for India, planning for the Ashes, planning for West Indies and Sri Lanka next summer. I don’t think it has crossed his mind not playing for England for the next four, five, six years.”\n\nA total of six three-year deals were offered – with Joe Root, Harry Brook and Mark Wood signing up, while white-ball captain Jos Buttler and injured seamer Jofra Archer have gone for a middle ground by taking two-year options.\n\nThere are 26 deals in all, spanning the age range from 19-year-old Rehan Ahmed to 41-year-old James Anderson. Fifteen are on two-year options, with eight on traditional 12-month terms and top-up payments handed to seam trio Matthew Fisher, Saqib Mahmood and the uncapped John Turner.\n\nNobody has refused to sign, but several may have been disappointed not to make the cut. David Willey is the only member of the World Cup squad in India not to make the list, highly-rated all-rounder Will Jacks was also omitted despite being capped in all three formats over the last year and Jason Roy is out after terminating the remainder of his previous deal to play Major League Cricket in the United States last summer.\n\nKey was speaking in Bengaluru, where England will be hoping to boost a dreadful World Cup campaign with victory over Sri Lanka on Thursday, and admitted having a tough conversation with Willey.\n\n“It’s fair to say David wasn’t best pleased, as you can understand, being the only one out here not to get a contract,” he said.\n\n“It’s bloody tough, to be honest. We’d love to live in a world where you can just say we have a pot of extra cash and you can just give him something because he’s come out for the World Cup.”\n\nKey believes the new raft of contracts have effectively safeguarded England’s interests at a time when the sports tectonic plates are shifting fast.\n\nThe spending power of the biggest Indian-backed T20 brands means international boards are struggling to compete and there has been a real fear at the ECB that its most prized assets could be lured away from the national set-up entirely.\n\n“You don’t know what the future holds with franchise cricket; you don’t know when the first year-long deal for an English cricketer is going to be offered from a franchise,” he said.\n\n“So I’m pretty pleased because I think for the first time in this changing landscape for cricket we start to see what players really think and what they really do. And we’ve seen that everyone’s committed to English cricket.\n\n“I don’t want a world where you see your best players going off and (only) playing franchise cricket. I want to see them playing for England.”\n\nThree-year deals:\n\nH Brook, J Root, M Wood.\n\nTwo-year deals:\n\nR Ahmed, J Archer, G Atkinson, J Bairstow, J Buttler, B Carse, Z Crawley, S Curran, B Duckett, L Livingstone, O Pope, M Potts, A Rashid, J Tongue, C Woakes.\n\nOne-year deals:\n\nM Ali, J Anderson, B Foakes, J Leach, D Malan, O Robinson, B Stokes, R Topley.\n\nDevelopment deals:\n\nM Fisher, S Mahmood, J Turner.",

    "body": "For many in the Dallas area, Thursday’s Major League Cricket opening night will be their introduction to the sport.\n\nIf you are in that number, The Dallas Morning News has you covered.\n\nCricket has been a global staple for almost 200 years in the sports world. The first international sporting event of any kind was a cricket match between the United States and Canada in 1844. Today, the sport still draws hundreds of millions of viewers from across the globe. India, Pakistan, England and Australia are just a few of the countries that drive that viewership, and India is set to host the upcoming 2023 Cricket World Cup.\n\nRelated:UT-Dallas student Ali Sheikh highlights the rise of cricket in Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nWith America’s early British influence, cricket was once the most popular bat-and-ball sport in the U.S. before eventually getting beaten out by baseball.\n\nWith that historical context, here are a few things to know when watching cricket for the first time.\n\nMajor League Cricket\n\nThis summer is Major League Cricket’s inaugural season, and most of the games will take place at Grand Prairie Stadium. The league includes six teams – the Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom. Even though the teams are attached to different regions, they will all play matches in either Grand Prairie or Morrisville, N.C.\n\nEach team is backed by a bigger cricket entity that runs teams in T20 leagues around the world, many of which in the ultra-popular Indian Premier League.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Rider- Knight Riders Group\n\nMI New York- Mumbai Indians\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns- Cricket Victoria\n\nSeattle Orcas- GMR Group\n\nTexas Super Kings- Chennai Super Kings\n\nWashington Freedom- Cricket New South Wales\n\nThe matches will be played in the T20 format, meaning they will last around three hours and be limited to 20 overs per innings (more on that later).\n\nMany high-profile international players and investors will take part in the inaugural Major League Cricket season. Each team is allowed up to nine international players, and no more than six are allowed on the field at a time.\n\nRelated:‘Cricket City, USA:’ Grand Prairie is home to a new sports league with deep ties for many\n\nThe basics\n\nCricket involves two teams of 11 playing each other on an oval-shaped field trying to score the most runs. Two batsmen stand in the center of the field, called the pitch, where one tries to hit the ball delivered by the bowler. On each end of the pitch is a wicket, a set of three stumps and two bails. Each batsman stands in front of the wickets and will exchange places if the ball is hit. Each exchange equals one run.\n\nIf the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the field, it’s worth four runs -- hit it over the boundary and it’s worth six.\n\nThe other team tries to get them out by knocking the bail off the stump of the wicket with the ball before the batsmen complete an exchange.\n\nThe fielding team can also get a batsman out by catching a hit ball in the air or if the bowler hits the wicket, knocking the bails off the stumps. A batsman can choose not to swing or swing and miss at the ball, but is only out if the ball knocks the bails off the stumps of the wicket.\n\nTo put it in basic terms, the most excitement and cheers come when the ball is hit far, similar to baseball.\n\nFormats\n\nThere are a few different forms of cricket but they all fall under two categories, First-Class Cricket and Limited Overs Cricket. The difference is in the name.\n\nFirst-Class Cricket is the original form of the sport, and takes multiple days due to there being no overs limit. Each team has two innings in First-Class Cricket and bats until the entire team has recorded an out in each innings.\n\nThe two most common forms of Limited Overs Cricket are One-Day International and T20 Cricket. The difference between the two is how many overs there are. One-Day International, which is played in international cricket, has 50 overs, while T20 has 20 overs.\n\nT20 is the form Major League Cricket will play and is the format played by most professional leagues.\n\nEach form features a single inning per team, and the inning is complete when either 10 of the 11 batters are out or the set number of overs has been reached. One-Day International matches usually last around nine hours and T20 matches usually last around three.\n\nScorekeeping\n\nThe weeds of scorekeeping can get confusing, but the most important thing to know is that whoever scores more runs wins. When looking at a scoreboard, though, you may see numbers indicating the wickets and overs.\n\nHow exactly the scoreboard reads depends on which form of cricket is being played, but for T20 cricket, the runs, overs and wickets are what you’ll want to pay attention to. A scoreboard will often display the batting team’s runs next to their wickets in the innings. Then it will display how many overs and deliveries there have been in the innings and the opposing team’s score which may be labeled as the target.\n\nOvers\n\nA bowler can only bowl six deliveries at a time, which is called an over. After a bowler completes an over, the fielding team must switch bowlers. A player can bowl multiple times in an innings, but can’t bowl consecutive overs.\n\nThink of overs as at-bats, except the change from player to player between each over happens with the bowlers, not the batsmen. The batsmen do not change until they get out.\n\nOuts\n\nThere are several ways a batter or runner can get out, and they can be mostly categorized in two categories: a batsman can be caught out or the fielding team can knock the bail off the stumps of the wicket.\n\nWhile being caught out only comes from a ball being caught in the air, there are a few ways a team can get a batsman out by knocking the bails off the stumps of the wicket.\n\nHere are the most common ways an out can be recorded.\n\nThe fielding team can knock the bails off the stumps before the batsman reaches the crease that defines where they are safe (the bat is considered part of the body).\n\nA batsman can be bowled out, which is where the bowler delivers the ball past the batter and knocks the bails off the stumps.\n\nA batsman can be stumped out if they move past the line in front of the wicket called the popping crease and the wicketkeeper (think of this as the catcher) gains possession of the ball and knocks the bails off the stumps.\n\nA batsman can be called out if they allow the ball to hit them, and the umpire determines that the ball would’ve knocked the bails off the stumps. This is called a “leg before wicket.”\n\nThe fielding team must appeal to the umpire if they believe they got a batsman out who will confirm the out. If one of these occurrences happens and no one notices, the out won’t be called.",

According to a recent story that Mint wrote, Indian viewers are heavily skewed towards watching only the Indian Premier League and Legends League Cricket only. As per viewership data sourced from Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) subscribers, the opening match of the last Legends League Cricket (LLC)—a T20 cricket tournament featuring recently retired cricketers—recorded a TV rating or TVR of 0.51—the percentage of the audience which saw the entire match. It considered the current TV universe size of 800 million across 210 million addressable TV homes.\n\nIn comparison, Big Bash League, Pakistan Super League and SAT20 opening matches recorded a TVR of 0.05 each. Caribbean Premier League was at 0.01, while Lanka Premier League could get 0.04 TVR for the opening match.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Others at Lions level are also understood to have been sounded out about joining the global Twenty20 circuit’s newest venture, which is fuelled by Indian Premier League investment and is set to become more lucrative in future years.\n\nRoy’s two-year contract with Los Angeles Knight Riders is worth £300,000, highlighting why he was willing to sacrifice a third of his £58,000 incremental deal to sign up. Until last October, Roy held a full central contract but for players in their 30s, neither centrally-contracted nor automatic picks in England’s white-ball teams, the mushrooming of global T20 tournaments has presented a dilemma.\n\nDavid Willey, Alex Hales and Sam Billings all opted to play for franchises rather than go on international tours last summer, due to the stark difference in remuneration, and now players a level below are facing the same kinds of decisions.\n\nThroughout this 2023 county season, informal approaches have been made to players by companies who operate teams in different markets, sounding them out for multi-tournament deals.\n\nOne of the only problems delaying those kind of moves is that the franchise world does not yet have a suitable mechanism.\n\nAs nearly all major T20 leagues feature player auctions or drafts, an organisation would either have to agree a combined salary and top-up to that amount in the event of the individual purchases tallying less, or settling for an agreed price plus all auction and draft sums.",

    "body": "At the business end of its first-ever season, United States’ first ever professional T20 league – sanctioned by USA Cricket – has left impressive first footmarks. More than half the games across the two host cities of Dallas and Morrisville in the lead up to the final have been in front of sold out crowds. The star cast has featured the who’s who of T20 cricket in Rashid Khan, Mitchell Marsh, Quinton de Kock, Wanindu Hasaranga, Haris Rauf and more. The broadcast has aired across the country on CBS Sports, home of UEFA Champions League and the two big national love interests in National Football League (NFL) and National Basketball League (NBA). This, with an initial investment pot of over $120 million with investors that included Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella – Silicon Valley, check. And not to forget, the Minor League Cricket (MiLC), which was launched in 2021 as a developmental league to the MLC with 26 teams of its own and a budget upwards of $5 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The timelines work pretty well,” Dunmore believes, with a T20 World Cup being co-hosted next summer and cricket set to be introduced to the Olympics in Los Angeles five years down the line.\n\nBut hang on, cricket in the USA? It makes sense according to the marketing guy. “I do think if you know baseball, which most Americans obviously do, you really love a bat-ball sport with a lot of the same fundamentals as cricket,” Dunmore says. “If you go to Brazil or Italy, where there isn’t a big bat and ball sport, it’s going to be harder. At least here, we can translate that a six is a home run. You’re caught out when the ball’s in the air, things like that. They take some explaining. Some terminology of cricket can be a bit arcane. Why is a wicket three different things, for example. But once you get past that, I think the Americans can adopt the game pretty quickly.”\n\nThe first impressions have been ‘pleasantly’ surprising. “They’re actually surprised at how much action there is up against what they actually thought of the sport. The ball is in play a lot more in cricket. There’s a lot more big hitting, a lot more scoring, a lot more home runs/sixes.”\n\nIt isn’t the first time that the USA has looked outside of its fantastic four – Baseball, Basketball, American Football, Hockey – to adopt a more internationally followed sport. Not the first time Dunmore has been involved in doing so as well, having worked behind the scenes in America’s soccer revolution. With Major League Soccer (MLS) well into its 28th season, it was about time for ‘world’s second most popular sport’, as it has been introduced to the uninitiated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCricket though, is no soccer. “It’s a tough sport, right? It’s not like soccer where you can just pop it up on any rectangular field essentially, and play. Cricket takes a lot more work to get right and do it at a high level,” Dunmore states.\n\n“I’ve got a history of helping grow sports or introduce sports in the US,” Dunmore tells with a chuckle, before sharing a past that connects both him and America to cricket. “I grew up a cricket fan in England. Got connected to it more when I lived in Indianapolis, which had a cricket pitch built several years ago. There were some high ambitions for em’, even the ICC hosted some events there. Indianapolis had a really good vision for it. Didn’t quite pan out in the end but I got connected to some of the cricket folks in the US at that point. And then, got the chance to help launch this (MLC).”\n\nWho’s playing and watching it in the States?\n\n“The feeling has been like playing cricket in India,” says LA Knight Riders’ Jaskaran Malhotra of his on-ground MLC experience. The Chandigarh-born USA cricketer, the first to hit six sixes in an over for the national side, isn’t far-fetched in his assessment. The two venues in the league have witnessed the local South East Asian diaspora take to the stands in large numbers. From Afghani flags to Sri Lanka and India jerseys. “Pakistani players don’t feature in the IPL but here we have them. The likes of Shadab (Khan) and Haris (Rauf)….the standard of cricket has been very high,” Malhotra adds.\n\nThere is then, the question of how the other ethnicities in the country are responding to the sport, if at all? “In my academy in Baltimore, Maryland, there are a lot of local people who are taking up the sport. White, native and African Americans,” says the USA cricketer. “My entire extended family is based out of here. They are getting warmed up to the sport. People who have stayed in America for five generations are now enjoying it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to ignite a fan culture, the MLC Vice President of Marketing takes to the white board, “We already have millions of cricket fans here, which is a really great base to start with. There’s a whole generation of expats from cricket loving countries, who are exposed to the sport but aren’t going to be fans of the US team unless we give them something to cheer for. And that’s the chance that we have for the first time. If you’re a fan growing up in Dallas, you can support your hometown team now in cricket. That’s not been the case before. If we can win that generation over as well as the immigrants that are already here….then it’s about converting kids that didn’t grow up with cricket. That will take a bit of trial and error but we want to solely increase the percentage of fans that didn’t grow up with cricket.”\n\nFor former England World Cup-winning pacer Liam Plunkett as well, cricket in the USA has been a familiar experience. “It has felt like a proper cricket tournament with packed crowds supporting all the sides involved,” he tells. The pacer’s LinkedIn bio speaks for itself: Starting a new adventure in the USA. Playing at Surrey Cricket Club during the fag end of his career, Plunkett was reached out by the MLC not just to play but “structure the national development coach role. Look after the players and help run the Philadelphia academy.”\n\nDoes he picture MLC making it to the big league status; like IPL is to cricket or NFL is to the USA? “I mean, that’s huge in America, isn’t it? NFL is like cricket in India. A religion to a lot of Americans. IPL is a different ball game altogether. If we can even climb the ladder towards that it would be amazing. But it would take a lot of time.”\n\nWith a World Cup and a first cricket featuring Olympics on the horizon, the land of opportunity has another.",

    "body": "Today we will discuss the salary of a Major League Cricket player in the USA.\n\nWhen it comes to professional sports in America, we often think of baseball, basketball, and football as the top dogs.\n\nBut there’s a new player in town that’s been gaining international attention: Cricket. Major League Cricket has been making waves in the sports world, especially with the growing popularity of T20 cricket. However, there’s one question on every cricket fan’s mind: just how much do these players make?\n\nMLC Cricketer Salary – By the Numbers\n\nThe average salary of a Major League Cricket player (MLC) is $60,526 (maximum 19 players in squad with a purse of $1.15 million).\n\nThe average salary for a domestic Major League cricketer is $39,375 ($315,000 purse for a total of 8 domestic players). The average salary for an overseas MLC cricketer is $92,200 ($830,000 for nine overseas slots).\n\nAbout $320,000 from the $1.15 million will be spent on the ten domestic players. Hence, $830,000 is remaining in the purse of each team to sign the nine overseas players. Note, that this amount may be skewed. According to a Daily Mail report, Jason Roy has been offered 300,000 pounds ($372,000) on a 2-year contract ($186,000/year). This means that LA Knight Riders, who signed Jason Roy, will be left with about $644,000 for their remaining 8 overseas signing (for an average of $80,500 per overseas player).\n\nCompared to other leagues, MLC ranks at #7 in the richest cricket leagues (according to average salaries).\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) – How Much Was Each Draft Pick?\n\nThe Major League Cricket (MLC) draft was held earlier this year in the NASA Space Center in Houston.\n\nThe draft picks ranged from $10,000 (8th round pick) to $75,000 (1st round pick). Rookies were drafted in the 9th round (reportedly around $2,500) and an additional tenth player will be picked for each team following the Minor League Cricket (MiLC) season preceding the MLC.\n\nMLC 2023 Draft Picks – Salary of Major League Cricket Player\n\n1. First Round Draft Pick ($75,000)\n\nHarmeet Singh (Seattle Orcas), Andries Gous (Washington Freedom), Steven Taylor (MI New York), Corey Anderson (San Francisco Unicorns), Ali Khan (Los Angeles Knight Riders), Rusty Theron (Texas Super Kings)\n\n2.

    "body": "Major League Cricket wrapped up its inaugural season yesterday at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas, and \"with an initial outlay of $120M and much infrastructure to build,\" investors know this is \"not a get-rich-quick scheme,\" according to Tom Dart of the London GUARDIAN. MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan said, \"We have a very clear path to where we think the league and the teams are going to be break-even and then profitable from then on ... in a very realistic timeframe. We are not talking 10 years or anything like that. We would like to see that happen in the three-to-five-year horizon.\" Dart noted Texas has a large South Asian population, with \"about half of the state’s 450,000 Indian Americans living in the Dallas area.\" Texas Super Kings co-owner Anurag Jain said, \"There is a good springboard of Indian, South Asian and Commonwealth diaspora that are here. Eventually we’ll explore other markets just like soccer did in the US 30 years ago.\" As for the players, Washington Freedom owner Sanjay Govil said that overseas players are \"enticed by the opportunity to spend a few weeks in the US -- and by salaries that are on a par with high-grade T20 leagues around the world.\" But the league knows that U.S. growth is the true goal. Jain: \"Whatever we do, whoever the owners are, ultimately this is an American league, it’s an American product.\" Jain also pointed out that matches were \"timed to appeal to US prime-time viewers.\" Srinivasan: \"Our line-ups, all of them have a strong US domestic component, so this is a platform for growing American cricket in all respects. This is not meant to be anything other than that\" (London GUARDIAN, 7/30).\n\nONLY THE BEGINNING: The Seattle Orcas ownership group said this first MLC season has \"been a commercial success.\" Over two-thirds of the matches “have been sold out,” and the demand for playoffs tickets “exceeded stadium capacity.” CBS “even started broadcasting some games.” However, the Orcas ownership group said that for the game to see “long-term success” in the U.S., \"building a pipeline from youth to adulthood is crucial.” Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar said that with a “large number of immigrants in the Seattle area from cricket-loving countries like India, Pakistan and New Zealand,\" there is an “appetite for the sport regionally.” Somasegar said that Grand Prairie Stadium was a \"proof of concept,” but the Orcas are “working to build a 20-acre cricket venue in Marymoor Park in Redmond that would hold up to 6,000 people.” He added that the “hope is to have the stadium ready for the 2025 season” (PUGET SOUND BUSINESS JOURNAL, 7/31).",
    "summary": "The inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC) has concluded at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. Despite an initial investment of $120M, the league's co-founder Vijay Srinivasan is confident that the league will break even and become profitable within a three-to-five-year horizon. The league has received significant interest from the South Asian diaspora in Texas, with a large Indian American population in the Dallas area. The league has also attracted top international players with competitive salaries. While the league has seen commercial success in its first season, with over two-thirds of matches sold out and CBS broadcasting some games, the long-term success of the game in the US depends on building a pipeline of young American players. The Seattle Orcas ownership group is working to build a new 20-acre cricket venue in Redmond, Washington, with the hope of having it ready for the 2025 season.",

While it was a relief that the tournament started strongly, recording $8 million in revenue as I first reported last year, the pressure is on for MLC to back up that success.\n\n\"We were just holding our breath on this tournament,\" San Francisco co-owner Anand Rajaraman told me after last season. \"We got this tournament to where we thought we would get to in the second or third year.\n\n\"There was a novelty factor in the first season, which won't be there in the second season. We have to consciously build on what we've started.\"\n\nDetails of the new season will be announced soon with organizers saying that the tournament will start on July 4 and finish by early August. That means the second edition of the MLC is set to be longer with owners hoping for a home and away format, where teams play each other twice, to eventually underpin the competition.\n\nFor the tournament, and cricket, to gain a foothold in communities, all the franchises will need their own stadiums, but that still appears a few years off.\n\nThe second edition of MLC, which has more than $100 million invested and can financially compete with many of the other high-profile T20 franchise leagues, is likely to be a gradual build.\n\nBut the momentum should help continue to change cricket's maligned perception in a country where the sport has struggled for relevancy and been riddled with internal turmoil.\n\nAfter cautionary tales, most notably in 2004 when an eight-team T20 professional league called Pro Cricket folded after just one season, cricket has started to make genuine inroads into the world's biggest sports market.\n\nBefore MLC's second season gets underway, U.S. will stage a cricket World Cup for the first time with June's T20 tournament set to be an era-defining event.",
    "summary": "* The second edition of MLC is set to start in July, with the six franchises announcing their retained international players, including Keiron Pollard, Nicholas Pooran, Faf du Plessis, and Quinton de Kock.\n* The retained players will help their respective teams build a brand around an identifiable core of players.\n* A domestic player draft will be held next month to complete the rosters for the teams.\n* The inaugural season of MLC was a success, with $8 million in revenue and large crowds, including local fans who were introduced to the sport.\n* The second season aims to build on this success, with the tournament starting on July 4 and finishing in early August, and potentially featuring a home and away format.\n* The long-term goal is for each franchise to have its own stadium, but that is still a few years away.\n* The MLC has invested over $100 million and is financially competitive with other top T20 franchise leagues.\n* The success of MLC and the upcoming T20 World Cup in the US in June could help change cricket's perception in the country and make it more relevant.",

    "body": "15.6 to TH David , Oh, that looked pretty adjacent and up goes the finger! David takes his time before deciding to take a second opinion. Fuller delivery, cuts into him and tenderizes his front pad, height will not been an issue. No bat involved. Pitching in line, impact line and the umpire's call will stand. Another massive breakthrough at a crucial juncture of the game. Dill was absolutely pumped up, he got the last laugh after being plonked for a six. 116 / 4\n\n6.1 to N Pooran , Plays down the wrong line and makes a mess of his stumps! What have you done Pooran? No Pollard in this game and this is a massive massive breakthrough! Netravalkar is right on money, pitched up and gets some movement as well, he has a big mow at it but didn't pick the line, middle stump is flattened and he has to take the long walk back into the pavilion. Lost his balance as he tried to pump it over midwicket. 24 / 2\n\n19.6 to Rashid Khan , Ball thunders into the front pad elicits a appeal and up goes the finger, thumps him low on the pad beating his sweep and that's a pretty straightforward decision for the umpire. 141 / 7\n\n9.2 to Shayan Jahangir , Once again inverses stance and tries to play fine but fails to connect as Akeal vociferously appeals for an lbw and the umpire eventually raises the dreaded finger. Jahangir decides to send it upstairs. No spike on the snicko as the ball passes the bat. Oh, that is stone dead! Three reds on the screen and Jahangir bites the dust after a scratchy 25, just when his team wanted him to tee off and accelerate, he has lost his wicket. 41 / 3\n\n2.2 to MW Short , Whoa! What a tremendous riposte from thunderBoult! Pulls his length back slightly, a cutter that befuddles him completely, goes for the big mow across the line and ends up dragging it back onto his stumps. Huge scalp! Just what the doctor ordered for MI. 14 / 1\n\n14.3 to GD Phillips , On a length and veers back in from round the wicket, he miscues a skier to long-off who gobbles it up down his throat. Slow ball outfoxes him completely and he was into his a shot a bit too early and Wiese in the deep is safe as a house, his bucket hands sends Glenn packing. 86 / 6\n\n18.1 to AJ Hosein , That's a screamer! Back of a length, angled into the body, he takes a step to the on side and then launches the ball straight into the hands of Wiese at long-on. He charged in pocketed the catch low down. A very timely scalp for MI New York after the big last over. 117 / 7\n\n18.3 to M Jansen , Wiese has taken another blinder! Stunning effort. Looking to go over extra cover for six but doesn't connect well, miscues the skier and once again Wiese was charging in from long-off and dived forward to hang on to it. What a snare, absolute ripper! Bat turned in his hand and it came off the splice, soaring high up in the air but didn't get the distance.. 118 / 8\n\n7.5 to AGS Gous , Round the wicket, length ball on middle, plinked to long-off! A misjudgment from Gous and Freedom have a big wicket. He coaxed him into going for this lofted drive and it was a regulation catch for Tim David - smoothly done. Another momentum-breaker but MI need to find wickets at regular intervals.. 48 / 2\n\n11.6 to AJ Pienaar , Tries to work this through square leg and gets beaten, massive appeal and he is adjudged lbw. Sent upstairs. Tossed up on a length and its straightening on middle and leg, nothing on the snicko, pitching outside off, impact in line and crashing right onto the leg stump so the on-field decision stands. MI are now in the driving seat thanks to Kenjige who first got Mukhtar run out and now traps Pienaar lbw - rising up to the occasion and doing a fantastic job for his skipper! The required run rate is getting out of hand and wickets are tumbling! Problems for Freedom. 72 / 5",

    "body": "Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has said that Major League Cricket could negatively affect the popularity of T20 Blast. Maxwell played for Birmingham Bears in this year's T20 Blast.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio, Maxwell said T20 Blast could be affected negatively with the advent of the popular MLC. In the previous T20 Blast season, Maxwell scored 248 runs from 14 matches at an average of 17.71, while striking at 153.08.\n\n“I think now the Major League Cricket tournament's come in, that's going to affect the Blast really badly. When you've got an opportunity to go over to America for two weeks, compared to 14 games here with a stressful schedule where you're travelling all over the place,” said Maxwell.\n\nHe went on to say that the fixture list of T20 Blast is packed which can really drain the players physically and mentally. MLC kick-started on July 14 with Texas Super Kings defeating LA Knight Riders in the opening match.\n\n“There was one week where we played on a Tuesday in Durham, Thursday in Leeds and then Friday here in Birmingham - that's three games in four days with a day's travel in between. It can really drain you, your body and mentally,” Maxwell added.\n\nThe Australian said Major League Cricket looks more attractive and can pull bigger crowds, while having a shorter schedule.\n\n“I found that very tough this year and I think with the Major League being a lot more attractive, bigger crowds, I think there's eight [six] overseas players per team, the excitement of a new tournament, it's only two weeks long. Less of a burden on your schedule. I think it's going a lot more attractive to some overseas players,” said Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell is not part of the Australian Test side which is currently facing England in the five-match Ashes 2023 series, with the fourth match of the series set to be played at Old Trafford in Manchester.",

    "body": "When my father got a job teaching in the United States, we left India behind, and cricket along with it. When I was completing my high school education in Alabama, and going to college at Auburn University, I could no longer watch the matches being played back in India, and there was no easy way to follow the ups and downs of the season. On the odd occasion, we would gather together a group of fans–usually South Asian and British expats–and take over a local baseball field to play some pickup cricket. But for the most part, we had no way to stay connected to cricket. It’s the world’s second most popular sport–but in the United States, it was still unknown.\n\nIn the time since then, the sports world has undergone many changes. The professionalization of the business of sports has transformed sports leagues and teams. They are now complex businesses with multiple revenue streams, from live entertainment and intellectual property to hospitality, catering, fashion, and real estate. More and more teams are part of a diversified portfolio of assets, with media rights, technology, IP, real estate holdings, and large operating teams focused on optimizing profitability.\n\nThe relentless pursuit of financial optimization has brought with it a range of new ways for fans to view and connect with the teams they love. Along with advances in technology, this new approach has opened up avenues like streaming, betting, and fantasy, providing paths for fans to engage with their favorite sports and players on a local and global level. Today, an Indian-American family living in Alabama can stream highlights and full matches being played by the best Indian cricket teams, no matter where they are competing.\n\nYet even as these changes have broadened access for casual and devoted fans alike, taken to their extreme, they risk eroding the passion that drives the unique relationship between teams and fans. When fans are seen as customers, rather than passionate supporters, we lose some of the purity of sport. And when teams are managed like high-performing financial assets, the fan experience becomes similar across teams and leagues, eliminating some of the quirks and idiosyncrasies that used to make fandoms across regions unique. With a more professionalized experience comes a sense of distance; even with more opportunities for access, fans are held at a certain remove.\n\nThat’s why, when the opportunity arose to launch a new professional cricket league in the United States, I jumped at the chance. Here was an opportunity to share a sport that I loved with others who love it–to provide the kind of personal experience that increasingly is missing from other professional sports. Out of this idea came Major League Cricket­–a new franchise league in the United States. Currently comprising six teams, with squads from Texas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle joining the Washington Freedom (the team I own, based in Washington, DC), the league’s 2023 season will feature 19 matches played over 18 days, building up to the first-ever MLC championship final on Jul. 30, 2023. As many teams have a connection to franchises in the India Premier League, we have structured the season so that matches will take place during Indian cricket’s regular off-season. What’s more, we can offer streaming opportunities that provide additional access to fans without cheapening their experience.\n\nOne of the elements that make this new venture unique is the owners. From Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan to Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, the owners have the same kind of connection to the sport that I do–one built on a history of true fandom and a desire to share their excitement with others.\n\nThere is no doubt that our sport will grow and change as time goes on. Make no mistake, I and others who have invested in this new league see an opportunity to grow cricket in the United States both as a passion project and as a business. But we are determined never to lose the purity and the fandom of sports–and to safeguard the experience that is so important to us all.\n\nSanjay Govil is the chairman of the board at Infinite Computer Solutions and owner of the Washington Freedom.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.",

The 26 team franchise affair is touted to be a semi professional league underpinning the MLC, a developmental league on the lines of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. The tournament, spanning over 2 months, will see over 150 T20 games being played over 15 states in the US.\n\nThere have been major overhauls in the makeup of the squads that took the field last year. Defending champions, Seattle Thunderbolts have been severely impacted by the spate of departures as captain Harmeet Singh, Andries Gous, Shubham Ranjane and Phani Simhadri move down to the Central and Southern Conference teams.\n\nIn a surprise move, Silicon Valley Strikers parted ways with captain Unmukt Chand who's been the most prolific batter of the league over two seasons apart from having the Strikers lift the silverware in the inaugural season. Former Pakistan and MI New York allrounder, Hammad Azam will now be at Dallas Mustangs. Azam was named the MVP of the inaugural season before an injury laden second season mostly saw him out of action for Golden State Grizzlies. A slew of PSL cricketers will call quits to Pakistan cricket after qualifying as local cricketers in the MiLC including the likes of former Pakistan U19 captain Hassan Khan, Imran Khan Jnr. and Zia ul Haq.\n\nThe league will also see USA national players in action as they strive to remain relevant in the wake of cricketers like Corey Anderson, Harmeet Singh, Smit Patel and Shadley Van Schalkwyk qualifying for the national team after serving their cool off period. Skipper Monank Patel will make his way across the Hudson to play for the New Jersey Stallion after appearing for the Empire State Titans last year. Steven Taylor is set to miss the season owing to his CPL commitments with the Jamaica Tallawahs.\n\n\"The recent success of Major League Cricket shows the strong appetite for cricket in America and the long-term plan to build American cricket is dependent on a successful pipeline of talent coming through Minor League Cricket,\" said Zubin Surkari, Tournament Director, Minor League Cricket. \"The third season of MiLC will allow fans to see many players who featured in MLC up close while giving the next generation of American cricket stars the chance to shine.\"\n\nThe 26 teams are divided into Atlantic and Pacific Conferences. The Atlantic conference is further segregated into eastern and southern divisions while the Pacific conference is further bifurcated into western and central divisions. The league stage and playoff rounds will culminate in a finals week at the Grand Prairie Stadium, the site of the MLC final, on October 6-7.\n\n© Cricbuzz",

There was one week where we played on a Tuesday in Durham, Thursday in Leeds and then Friday here in Birmingham - that's three games in four days with a day's travel in between.\"\n\n\"It can really drain you, your body and mentally,\" Maxwell added. \"I found that very tough this year and I think with the Major League being a lot more attractive, bigger crowds, I think there's eight [six] overseas players per team, the excitement of a new tournament, it's only two weeks long. Less of a burden on your schedule. I think it's going a lot more attractive to some overseas players.\"\n\nMaxwell didn't have the best of T20 Blast seasons with the Bears, scoring 248 runs from 14 matches at an average of 17.71, striking at 153.08.\n\nWhere is Glenn Maxwell currently?\n\nGlenn Maxwell is playing in the County Championship in England for Warwickshire.\n\nIn his first match of the season, he scored a 67-ball 81, hitting 10 fours and two sixes. The knock, which came soon after Australia's loss in the third Ashes Test, sparked interest in him having an outside chance to be in the Aussie team.\n\nThe fourth Ashes Test of the five-match series will be played between July 19-23 in Manchester.",
    "summary": "* Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell believes the MLC in the USA is more attractive to international stars than England's T20 Blast due to its simpler and shorter schedule, and bigger crowds.\n* The MLC is a six-team tournament, where each side plays the others once in the group stage followed by the playoffs, which is less demanding compared to the Blast's 14-match schedule.\n* The MLC's shorter two-week schedule is seen as less burdensome on players, making it more attractive to overseas players.\n* The MLC allows for eight overseas players per team, which adds to its appeal.\n* Maxwell's comments suggest that the MLC may draw top international talent away from the T20 Blast.",

    "body": "Major League Cricket, the first T20 cricket competition in the United States, will begin Thursday, July 13 with the Texas Super Kings taking on the Los Angeles Knight Riders. Here’s everything you need to know about this competition.\n\nCricket in the United States? When did this happen?\n\nThis league has been in the works for quite some time, and will finally be taking place this summer. It is backed by the founders of Willow TV, the primary cricket broadcaster in North America, several prominent investors and the Times Group of India.\n\nDoes USA have a cricket team?\n\nInterestingly enough, the first ever international cricket match on record was played in the United States between America and Canada. Now, this was back in the 1800s and Americans likely saw cricket as a British game and gravitated more towards baseball. That doesn’t mean the game isn’t prominent across the country at a grassroots level.\n\nUSA does have an international team, and just played in the ODI World Cup qualifiers. They didn’t win a single match, but they will be more prominently featured in the 2024 T20 World Cup as a co-host with the West Indies.\n\nHow many teams are in Major League Cricket?\n\nThere are six teams in MLC this season. They are the Super Kings, Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians New York, Washington Freedom, Seattle Orcas and San Francisco Unicorns. If some of those names sound familiar, it’s because four of the six teams are owned by IPL franchise owners. Three of them have adopted the IPL team name in Texas, LA and New York.\n\nHow many games will be played this season?\n\nThere will be just 19 games in the tournament, which will run over two weeks. 15 games will be in the group stage. There will be an eliminator, two qualifiers and a final similar to the IPL playoffs.\n\nWho are some of the prominent players in MLC?\n\nThere won’t be any big-name Indian players due to BCCI regulations and the team currently being on tour, but MLC did a great job bagging other big names. Kieron Pollard, Faf du Plessis, Jason Roy, Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Aaron Finch and Quinton de Kock have all been prominent on the international cricket scene. Many of the fans attending these games will know those players.\n\nWhere are MLC games being played?\n\nThere are two venues for MLC games this season. Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas is the main venue and has the first eight group games, while Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina will have the next seven group games. The playoffs return to Grand Prairie Stadium. This is surely a trial run for the expansion of venues across the country, especially since there’s no North Carolina-based team.\n\nWill MLC games be available on TV and livestream?\n\nAll games will be broadcasted on Willow TV and available through willow.tv with a subscription login.\n\nWho is favored to win?",
    "summary": "**Tournament Details**\n\n* The MLC tournament will start on July 13 with the Texas Super Kings taking on the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n* There are six teams participating in the tournament: Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians New York, Washington Freedom, Seattle Orcas, and San Francisco Unicorns.\n\n**Schedule**\n\n* The tournament will consist of 19 games, with 15 games in the group stage, followed by an eliminator, two qualifiers, and a final.\n* The tournament will run for two weeks.\n\n**Teams and Players**\n\n* Four of the six teams are owned by IPL franchise owners, and three teams have adopted IPL team names.\n* Prominent international players participating in the tournament include Kieron Pollard, Faf du Plessis, Jason Roy, Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, Aaron Finch, and Quinton de Kock.\n\n**Venues**\n\n* The tournament will be played across two venues: Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n* The playoffs will return to Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\n**Broadcast**\n\n* All games will be broadcast on Willow TV and available through willow.tv with a subscription login.\n\nNote: The article does not provide information on who is favored to win the tournament.",

    "title": "Silicon Valley investors expect cricket to finally crack America",
    "date": "Tue May 30 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Officially, it is called Major League Cricket; a more apt name, perhaps, would be the American IPL. Most of the owners are the same with four of the six sides having Indian Premier League owners.\n\nMajor League Cricket is a competition whose impact will be felt across the pond, as England have already learned with Jason Roy signing and Moeen Ali being approached too.\n\nPer-game, it is already among the five best-paying leagues in the world; the salary cap per side, £930,000, is only just below the Hundred’s £1m, even though Major League Cricket has one-third fewer games.\n\nOn July 13 in Grand Prairie, Texas, Major League Cricket will begin its first season. Professional cricket in the US has long existed more as International Cricket Council fantasy than reality. But, after a series of mooted leagues have collapsed at inception, this time is different. Over 40 international players have been lured to the US for the tournament – Quinton de Kock, Anrich Nortje and Roy have already been signed, with Trent Boult and Sunil Narine expected to be announced soon. About £100 million has already been pledged in spending for the league, with over half of this already invested.\n\nMuch of this has come from some of the most-prominent figures in Silicon Valley, including Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft who is an investor in Major League Cricket and also a co-owner of the Seattle Orcas.\n\n“He’s a cricket fan and passionate about it,” says Tom Dunmore, the vice president of marketing at Major League Cricket. “It’s a great fit to have him as an investor-partner.”\n\nNadella, who initially moved from India to the US to study computer science, embodies the importance of the South Asian diaspora for Major League Cricket. All six teams have either IPL owners or some ownership from businessmen born in India. The South Asian diaspora are also central to Major League Cricket’s belief that the competition will have a sizeable audience. The US now has 4.6 million people classed as Indian American, up from 1.9 million in 2000; two-thirds of these were born in India.\n\nThis group tend to be highly educated and, often, very wealthy too. The median household income of Indian-Americans is double the national average, making accessing the group hugely attractive for advertisers. If demographics are destiny, then demographics might now be on cricket’s side in the US. “That’s changed the sport really in the US over the last couple of decades – immigration from South Asia, and other places,” Dunmore says. “It’s built a much larger support for the game.”\n\nWhenever there is talk of cricket in the US, it tends to provoke guffaws at the notion of cricket usurping baseball as the nation’s summer outdoor game. But the size and wealth of the country is such that cricket does not need to usurp baseball as America’s bat-and-ball game of choice for the US to be a significant part of the sport’s global landscape. Indeed, even without Major League cricket, it already is a force with the US thought to be the fifth most lucrative broadcasting market for the International Cricket Council’s global events like the World Cup.\n\nThis year’s tournament will only run for 18 days, with the six teams playing all their matches in Dallas and another venue expected to be in North Carolina. All six teams are developing stadiums - generally with planned capacities around 10,000 - that will enable the competition to run a home-and-away format. This will entail the tournament expanding from 19 games to around 34; next summer is already planned to include more games than this year.\n\nUltimately, Major League hopes to develop beyond the existing six teams. “In the long run, there’s room for expansion,” Dunmore says. “There are great cities with massive cricket-loving populations that don’t have teams, but we want to do it carefully - build the league first.”\n\nConflict with the rest of the global calendar, already saturated, is inevitable. Being played in the northern hemisphere summer means that Major League Cricket’s competition is less fierce than for other new leagues; four major T20 leagues were played in tandem in January. While Major League Cricket hopes to minimise - or ideally completely avoid - a clash with the Hundred, an enlarged competition will heighten the difficulties for the T20 Blast in signing the best international players.\n\nYet, for all the focus on Major League Cricket, as important is what lies underneath. Most cricket ventures in North America like the India-Pakistan ODIs in Toronto in the 1990s, or the Cricket All-Stars matches between teams captained by Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne in 2015 – have focused on monetising the market that already exists.\n\nThrough Minor League Cricket, a development league with 26 teams that launched in 2021, Major League Cricket is trying to build the sport’s infrastructure in the US. It is an onerous challenge: governance in US cricket is so chaotic that one insider likens it to “the Wild West”. The country has a crippling shortage of reasonable quality facilities: there are only thought to be 10 turf wickets in the US. Under seven weeks out from the first ball in Major League Cricket, a home broadcaster has yet to be confirmed.\n\nAnd so, investors need to be sure of one thing: profits, if they come, will not be swift. While this is true of all new sports leagues - even the IPL took until 2018 for all franchises to reliably make money - the uncertainties are greater in the US. But so, perhaps, are the possibilities, especially with the US co-hosting the T20 World Cup next year and growing optimism that cricket will feature in the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 2028.\n\nIn many ways, there is an essential irony to the US’s attempts to mimic the IPL. Lalit Modi, the IPL co-founder, modelled the competition on US sports leagues. Just like US leagues, the IPL was set-up with a salary cap to ensure relative equality between teams and maintain competitive balance, and has no promotion and relegation - pleasing owners, who loathe the uncertainty. And, just like US leagues, the IPL was designed as a fusion of sport and entertainment. Essentially, the IPL marked the Americanification of Indian cricket. Now, the circle is almost complete: the US is trying to learn from the IPL.",
    "summary": "**Name and Structure**: Major League Cricket (MLC) is a new cricket competition in the US, often referred to as the American IPL due to similarities with the Indian Premier League. Four of the six teams have IPL owners.\n\n**Key Facts**:\n\n* The first season will begin on July 13 in Grand Prairie, Texas, with 6 teams playing 19 games in 18 days.\n* The salary cap per side is £930,000, making it one of the top 5 paying leagues in the world.\n* Over 40 international players have been signed, including Jason Roy, Quinton de Kock, and Anrich Nortje.\n* The league has secured £100 million in investment, with half of it already invested.\n\n**Importance of the South Asian Diaspora**: The South Asian diaspora is crucial to MLC's success, with all 6 teams having IPL owners or Indian businessmen as investors. The US has a large and wealthy Indian-American population, making it an attractive market for advertisers.\n\n**Future Plans**: The league plans to expand beyond the initial 6 teams, with a potential home-and-away format and increased games in future seasons. However, conflict with the global cricket calendar is inevitable.\n\n**Challenges**: The league faces challenges such as building infrastructure, finding a home broadcaster, and navigating the complex governance of cricket in the US.",

In the end, he spoons it off the toe-end and Imad calls early to complete an easy return catch!. 63 / 4\n\n201919.5060220\n\n5.5 to DP Conway , Conway bites the dust! Full and into the stumps. Conway advances and backs away, looking to clear extra cover. Gets a little too close to the ball, though, and cannot quite get underneath it. Arrows it off the toe-end and Parnell does the rest at extra cover, despite a slight bobble!. 40 / 2\n\n301906.3351010401614.00111000\n\n8.2 to Milind Kumar , holes out to long on! TSK slip further into trouble! Full and not offering any width on middle and off. Milind comes down the track and has a swing at it. Does not get the elevation he is after, though, and ends up hitting it in the air to long on's right.

    "title": "Major League Cricket is selling out every game and it’s already a massive success",
    "date": "Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Nestled in Raleigh-Durham’s Research Triangle, the national hub of science and technological research, thousands of transplanted cricket fans get the taste of home they’ve been missing. Adorned in the jerseys of their favorite Indian Premier League teams and carrying the flags of their home nations — 3,000 pack into the newly-constructed Morrisville Cricket Ground to see the final Major League Cricket (MLC) game in North Carolina, before the league heads back to Texas to close out the season.\n\nFrom knowledgeable die-hard fans, to those new to the game, young and old alike, there’s one prevailing sentiment sweeping the grounds: Cricket in the United States is going to work.\n\nMLC is finishing up its inaugural season, and Tuesday night saw the league-leading Seattle Orcas take on MI New York in an absolute nail-biting game which saw the Orcas pull out a win with four balls remaining in their innings, thanks largely to masterful batting from South African international Heinrich Klaasen, who finished the match with 110 runs, scoring the first century in league history in the process.\n\nThe result of this one game was far less important than what Tuesday night represented: Five games in Morrisville, five straight sellouts, matching the runaway success that MLC has had in Texas, where games have been selling out an even larger cricket ground in Grand Prairie (a suburb of Dallas) since the league began two weeks ago.\n\nThis season was designed as a proof of concept, and that concept has been proven. The appetite for cricket is alive, and the sky is the limit. Intentionally targeting markets with large South Asian populations, Major League Cricket has already won a cult following of Indian, Pakistani and Afghan fans — relishing the opportunity to see some of the best players from cricket’s past and present play in their new backyard.\n\nTuesday night also gave way to tremendous emotion, as Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan, now playing for MI New York was swarmed by fans at the fence while fielding. Predominantly teenagers and children, the majority of whom are refugees who found asylum in the United States. They had a rare chance to see a national sporting hero in their new home — and it clearly affected Khan, who did his best to continue playing while signing autographs for the legion of supporters chanting his name.\n\nMLC has managed to capture the party-like atmosphere of T20 cricket. The ground was a festival of color and sound, mashing together traditional cricket culture and a new environment. The PA system alternated between playing Indian pop songs and western Top-40 hits, whistles and horns droned through the crowd after ever big shot, and fans were encouraged to bring their own coolers of food and drink to fight back the heat. This league isn’t a cash grab, but a celebration of cricket and a love letter to the game.\n\nMajor League Cricket is already achieving something most sporting league dream of: Attracting young fans. At least 80 percent of those in attendance were 35-years-old or younger, with a majority of children and teenagers in attendance. Sure, one might chalk that up to being dragged to the game by their parents — but every fan in attendance was engaged, cheering, and excited to be a part of something that felt big, special, and on the verge of truly breaking out.\n\nArjun, a native of Mumbai now living in the Triangle, brought his wife and two young children to experience the game. “Cricket was a part of my childhood,” he says “now I want it to be a part of theirs.”\n\nThe next step is outreach and education. The league can certainly survive on a migrant population alone, but to thrive it will require transcending traditional cricket fans and capturing Americans who don’t know the game. To this end T20 is the perfect onboarding process, allowing games to last 3-4 hours, in a format which rewards big risks, huge hits, and plenty of excitement.\n\nThat’s no easy feat, but as the sport grows the FOMO of the next big thing in sports will set in. Especially as stadiums keep selling out and word of mouth travels about just how much fun cricket can be. Nobody left the grounds on Tuesday night thinking it was just “okay,” but rather even non-traditional fans seeing their first match raved about how incredible the experience was.\n\n“I was dragged here by my British coworker,” says Tyler, a software engineer from Raleigh. “I’ve heard of cricket before, but never seen it. This was incredible. Everyone would love this.” Tyler admits he didn’t always understand what he was watching, but he’s already hooked, “I’m definitely going to learn the rules and come back next year.”\n\nIt’s been over 20 years since I saw a cricket match in person. The 2002-03 Ashes 5th test between Australia and England was the final sporting event I saw back home before moving to the United States for college. Never in my wildest dreams did I think cricket would follow me to NC, but here I was, in 92-degree heat, with a smile plastered on my face for hours on end. I wasn’t the only one, because Morrisville has caught cricket fever — and it’s only going to spread.\n\nMajor League Cricket isn’t just here as a curiosity, it’s truly arrived.",
    "summary": "**Event:** The final MLC game in North Carolina, featuring the Seattle Orcas and MI New York\n\n**Result:** Seattle Orcas won the game with four balls remaining in their innings, thanks to Heinrich Klaasen's century (110 runs), the first in MLC history.\n\n**League Performance:** The inaugural season of MLC has been a success, with five straight sellouts in Morrisville, North Carolina, and similar success in Texas.\n\n**Attendance:** The game saw a packed stadium with 3,000 fans, predominantly from South Asian backgrounds, including Indian, Pakistani, and Afghan nationals who have settled in the US.\n\n** Atmosphere:** The game had a festive atmosphere, with a mix of traditional cricket culture and a modern, party-like vibe, featuring Indian pop songs, whistles, and horns.\n\n**Demographics:** The crowd was predominantly young, with at least 80% of attendees under 35 years old, including children and teenagers.\n\n**Outlook:** MLC is poised for growth, with a focus on outreach and education to attract non-traditional cricket fans and Americans who don't know the game. The T20 format, with its fast-paced, exciting gameplay, is seen as an ideal way to introduce new fans to the sport.",

The standard of the international players is amazing but I think what is going to be great for this tournament and country moving forward is the influence on the local talent.

Walking into the stadium it was amazing to see how much work has gone into getting it ready. The outfield looks green and lush. The pitches were really good and impressive. From that perspective, the tournament is already impressive.”\n\n“I see myself, in 10 or 15 years, coming into American sports and you can see the American feel watching the game of cricket which is unique to anywhere else in the world.”\n\nKieron Pollard (MI New York)\n\n“From an MI Perspective, we look at new talent and are able to scout those international players and when we look at it and go around the world in each tournament, the most important people are the domestic talent.”\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) 2023: Full Schedule (All times in IST)\n\nJuly 14 (6 am)\n\nTexas Super Kings vs Los Angeles Knight Riders (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 15 (2 am)\n\nMI New York vs San Francisco Unicorns (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 15 (6 AM)\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 16 (6 AM)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns vs Seattle Orcas (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 17 (2 AM)\n\nMatch 5 – Texas Super Kings vs Washington Freedom (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 17 (6 AM)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders vs MI New York (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 18 (6 AM)\n\nTexas Super Kings vs MI New York (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 19 (6 AM)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders vs San Francisco Unicorns (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 21 (3 AM)\n\nWashington Freedom vs Los Angeles Knight Riders (Church Street Park, Morrisville)\n\nJuly 22 (4 AM)\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Texas Super Kings (Church Street Park, Morrisville)\n\nJuly 23 (4 AM)\n\nWashington Freedom vs San Francisco Unicorns (Church Street Park, Morrisville)\n\nJuly 23 (11 PM)\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders vs Seattle Orcas (Church Street Park, Morrisville)\n\nJuly 24 (12 AM)\n\nMI New York vs Washington Freedom (Church Street Park, Morrisville)\n\nJuly 25 (4 AM)\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns vs Texas Super Kings (Church Street Park, Morrisville)\n\nJuly 26 (4 AM)\n\nMI New York vs Seattle Orcas (Church Street Park, Morrisville)\n\nJuly 28 (2 AM)\n\nEliminator (3 vs 4) (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 28 (6 AM)\n\nQualifier (1 vs 2) (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 29 (6 AM)\n\nChallenger (Qualifier Loser vs Eliminator Winner) (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)\n\nJuly 31 (6 AM)\n\nFinal (Qualifier Winner vs Challenger Winner) (Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas)",

    "date": "Tue Apr 30 04:01:54 2024",
    "body": "Washington is one of six teams in Major League Cricket (MLC), which began in 2023. The Freedom finished third in the inaugural season, won by New York.\n\nThe 2024 season will begin in July before the US co-hosts the T20 World Cup with the West Indies.\n\nA number of established cricket stars have already played in the US league, including Quinton de Kock of South Africa, Nicholas Pooran from the West Indies, Trent Boult from New Zealand and Australians Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch.\n\nLooking ahead, T20 cricket has been included for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games. So, why is cricket suddenly interested in the US – and does this interest go both ways?\n\nCricket in the US: what's the go?\n\nCricket is slowly becoming better known in the US.\n\nFirstly, it is because of the rising South Asian population who mostly love their cricket. It is a growing and affluent professional community – the South Asian diaspora is growing at a rapid rate across North America to the point that when you fly into most large US cities, you can spot cricket pitches.\n\nMany South Asian immigrants to the US (and Canada) are engineers, doctors and entrepreneurs with good educations and professional jobs – Indian-Americans are the most affluent group in America by median household income, while Sri Lankans and Pakistanis are two of the eight wealthiest segments.\n\nIn terms of education, 70% of Indian-Americans have at least a Bachelor's degree, compared to the US average of 28%.\n\nA lot of this affluence is ploughed into supporting local cricket leagues in the US and watching the MLC.\n\nIn terms of participation, cricket is still very much a niche sport in the US, with about 200,000 registered players. However, this has grown from around 30,000 registered players in 2006, with emigration from South Asia driving the lion's share of growth.\n\nConsuming cricket anytime, anywhere\n\nSecondly, live streaming has taken off worldwide in recent years, allowing Indians in the US to watch India Premier League (IPL) games back home, and Indians in India to live stream MLC matches.\n\nAccording to Chris Muldoon, chief strategy officer of Cricket NSW, there are more than 4 million subscribers to Willow TV's cricket-only streaming service throughout North America.\n\nThis means it is easy for most cricket fans can consume what they want, when they want it.\n\nThe growth of cricket franchises\n\nThirdly, IPL franchises are launching clubs and leagues around the world – in South Africa, the UAE and the US – to grow the sport and to attract talent and revenue to their respective franchises.\n\nThere is a strong IPL presence across many of the domestic T20 competitions that have launched in recent years, including in MLS where four IPL franchises are involved with the foundation clubs in New York, Dallas, Los Angeles and Seattle.\n\nThis is a big shift in cricket governance, as it is not just the cricket boards of Australia, England & Wales and India calling the shots on schedules – it is now the IPL franchises too.\n\nWhat does this mean for Australian cricket?\n\nSo, how does all of this affect elite cricket in Australia?\n\nAustralian cricketers have been competing in T20 competitions around the world for years now, with Cricket Australia occasionally having to step in to reduce the workloads of some of its best players.\n\nNow the MLC will force governing bodies and players to react to another competition in a packed cricket calendar.\n\nAccording to Muldoon, the opportunity in the US is too big to ignore. He says:\n\n\"The US is the world's most sophisticated and competitive sports and media market and Major League Cricket presents the most exciting and challenging opportunity in world cricket.\n\n\"The proliferation of franchise T20 cricket around the globe, much of it driven by the commercial success of the IPL as well as changing preferences of consumers, is changing the way cricket is consumed. And it is bringing new revenue into the sport – which in turn is making it increasingly attractive to the world's best players and coaches to be a part of these growing franchise leagues around the world on an almost full-time basis.\"",
    "summary": "**Current Status**: The MLC began in 2023 with six teams, including Washington Freedom, which finished third in the inaugural season. The 2024 season is set to start in July.\n\n**Established Players**: Notable cricket stars have played in the MLC, including Quinton de Kock, Nicholas Pooran, Trent Boult, Marcus Stoinis, and Aaron Finch.\n\n**Growth of Cricket in the US**: The growing South Asian population in the US, with their affinity for cricket, is driving the sport's popularity. The affluent professional community is supporting local cricket leagues and the MLC.\n\n**Streaming and Participation**: Live streaming has increased cricket's accessibility, and the number of registered players in the US has grown from 30,000 in 2006 to 200,000 currently.\n\n**IPL Franchises' Involvement**: IPL franchises are launching clubs and leagues worldwide, including in the US, to grow the sport and attract talent and revenue. This shift in cricket governance involves IPL franchises in domestic T20 competitions, including the MLC.\n\n**Impact on Australian Cricket**: The MLC will require governing bodies and players to adapt to another competition in the packed cricket calendar, potentially affecting Australian cricket.",

    "body": "Major League Cricket wants to sign up England's best players for future editions but its founders have dismissed claims it is a threat to English cricket as \"short-sighted\".\n\nThe inaugural T20 franchise tournament in the United States starts on Thursday (Friday 01:30 BST) with two England World Cup winners - Liam Plunkett and Jason Roy - involved.\n\n\"American sports fans want to see the best in the world. That's the demand in US professional sports,\" MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport.\n\n\"They don't want second-tier talent. They insist on the best. England is fortunate to have some of those with the likes of Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow and Harry Brook.\"\n\nEngland opener Roy decided to cancel his incremental white-ball deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) - worth £60,000-£70,000 - to play in MLC, where he could potentially earn £150,000 for the tournament between 13-31 July.\n\nThe 32-year-old previously claimed his \"priority is England\" with a 50-over World Cup in October but a lucrative franchise T20 tournament, and one which runs parallel to the English summer, has been seen as a threat to the England team and county cricket.\n\nSrinivasan insisted that notion was \"a little bit short-sighted\" and MLC is \"not looking to step on anyone's toes\".\n\nHe added: \"We want the best in the world to come here and we want to do it in a way that makes sense for the player, makes sense for their national team obligations and so on.\n\n\"We need to find a window in the global cricket calendar that makes sense to get the best players.\n\n\"I think MLC is bringing a lot of mainstream attention to the sport in the US and that's going to help the global cricket ecosystem.\"\n\nThe US men's national team have not qualified for a major ICC tournament since the 2004 Champions Trophy but will participate in the 2024 T20 World Cup as co-hosts alongside West Indies.\n\nAs an associate ICC member, USA Cricket only receives a fraction of the budget full ICC members get, and Srinivasan believes the sizable investment in the sport's infrastructure by MLC will be a boost to cricket in the country and help drive the national team forward.\n\nThis year's MLC will be played at two grounds - in Texas and North Carolina - but owners of the six franchises are committed to building new stadiums, while the tournament itself will give exposure to a quota of homegrown players.\n\n\"One of the things we identified was that cricket in the US is not going to be successful unless the US has a strong cricket team,\" added Srinivasan.\n\n\"It's not about putting up a tournament, then coming back 12 months later and doing it again. There has to be something more.\n\n\"What we are doing is not building these stadiums to play MLC once a year. We want the US men's, women's and U19s teams to be playing in these venues where the best teams in the world come and play against them.\n\n\"On the back of it, the US needs a competitive national team. That's why when the ICC T20 World Cup comes to the US next year we want to make sure the US can compete with the rest of the world.\n\n\"The world of cricket is going through a big transition but for us, MLC is a platform for all things US cricket. We don't view it in isolation and a stand-alone thing that is detached. There's a lot more legs to the stool.\"",

    "title": "If inaugural season is an indication, Major League Cricket is here to stay",
    "date": "Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "The inaugural season of the Major League Cricket concluded at the Grand Prairie Stadium in suburban Dallas, with MI New York being crowned as the first champion. Stand-in captain Nicholas Pooran played a swashbuckling knock, scoring an unbeaten 137 runs off just 55 balls, which helped the Big Apple franchise secure victory against the formidable Seattle Orcas – a team that had appeared to be the strongest until the final match. At the halfway stage, Seattle’s 183 for 9 looked like a challenging total, but MI New York achieved the target with four overs left, thanks to Pooran’s superlative innings.\n\nThe morning after the end of Season 1, one thing is clear: MLC is here to stay.\n\nWhile some may view it as a bold prediction for a fledgling league that has just completed its first season and hosted fewer than 15 matches, the quality of entertainment and the passionate response from fans indicate that cricket has found a solid foothold in the United States.\n\nREAD: Breathtaking hundred by Heinrich Klaasen helps Seattle Orcas defeat MI New York (July 25, 2023)\n\nHere are a few things that serve as signposts that MLC will be embraced by the American audience and become a part of the US sporting landscape.\n\nQuality of cricket:\n\nThe quality of cricket in the first year of MLC has been above average. Many of the bigwigs that the teams signed did not fail to deliver. West Indies T20 international Nicholas Pooran, who singlehandedly won the final for MI New York, was the top scorer with 388 runs, at an impressive average of 64.66. Following him in the list of top scorers were two South African Orcas players, wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock who scored 264, and Heinrich Klaasen with 235 runs.\n\nWhile Pooran’s innings defined the final, Klaasen scored a similarly breathtaking knock when MI New York and Orcas faced each other in the final league game in Morrisville. He scored a 44-ball 110 containing 9 fours and 7 sixes to help Orcas defeat MI New York.\n\nAmong bowlers, New Zealander Trent Boult was the top wicket-taker with 22 scalps. Notable performances included Washington Freedom’s Mumbai-born left-arm fast-medium pacer Saurabh Netravalkar’s six-wicket haul for just 9 runs against San Francisco during the league stage.\n\nREAD: Washington Freedom was a no-brainer of an investment: Sanjay Govil (July 17, 2023)\n\nMany US stars also performed well, including Seattle’s Australia-born Cameron Gannon, who finished second among bowlers with 11 wickets, and New York’s Nosthusha Kenjige, who was born in Auburn, Alabama.\n\nThe excitement generated by these performances underlines the potential for cricket to capture the American imagination.\n\nFan engagement:\n\nFans, especially those from various South Asian diasporas, embraced MLC with both hands and showed up at the stadiums to root for their teams, braving the unusually hot July summer. In Morrisville, NC, most matches were sold out.\n\nREAD: Major League Cricket brings T20 competition to America (July 14, 2023)\n\nThe fan engagement in the first season shows that the foundation for cricket’s success in America is solid, given the presence of more than 6 million cricket enthusiasts from the South Asian American diaspora. Additionally, significant populations from cricket-loving regions like the Caribbean, Britain, and Australia add to the diverse and expansive fanbase that can sustain cricket in the US. This multicultural blend creates a unique cricketing community, ready to embrace the game with passion.\n\nMedia attention:\n\nMLC’s inaugural season received substantial coverage from major US news outlets such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, as well as prominent sports publications like ESPN. The interest shown by these media outlets, who previously viewed cricket as nothing more than a curiosity, indicates the sport’s growth trajectory.\n\nWhat does the future hold for MLC?\n\nWhile reaching the status of the four major sporting leagues — NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL — may be an unattainable goal for MLC in the foreseeable future, there is potential for it to reach popularity akin to Major League Soccer. Interestingly, MLC’s debut season coincided with the Major League Soccer debut of Lionel Messi, a sports superstar of global renown.\n\nAs Washington Freedom owner Sanjay Govil told the American Bazaar, there is enough space for cricket in the United States. America is known for its patronage of various sports, including golf, tennis, and lacrosse, providing ample opportunities for cricket to flourish outside the established leagues.\n\nREAD: Major League Cricket makes Viacom18 media partner in India (July 10, 2023)\n\nThe success of the inaugural season is likely to attract more elite and star cricketers from around the world, elevating the level of competition and increasing the game’s popularity. The presence of renowned players will undoubtedly draw more attention and create a ripple effect on the sport’s growth.\n\nAnother boost will be the construction of new stadiums. Already, teams like Freedom and Orcas are moving ahead with plans for their own stadiums, indicating their willingness to invest in the sport’s infrastructure. World-class stadium experiences will further enhance the appeal of MLC matches and encourage greater fan participation.\n\nOver time, MLC will add more teams. It is likely that those teams from the Indian Premier League that sat out this year will join during the expansion drive, as will men and women from the South Asian diaspora with deep pockets that missed out during the first round.\n\nAnother positive to emerge in the first season was the enthusiasm shown by some of the owners to be at the park and root for their teams.\n\nFor the final, MI owner Nita Ambani, the wife of billionaire Mukesh Ambani and the team’s superfan, flew all the way from Mumbai, indicating that the Ambanis see the US market as more than just an outpost of cricket.\n\nFreedom’s Govil was present for every match his team played. Seattle’s Sanjay Parthasarathy and Texas Super King’s Anurag Jain were also at the stadium rooting for their teams on many game days.\n\nThe success of MLC’s inaugural season demonstrated that cricket could find a secure home in America. The quality of cricket, the media attention, and the passionate fan response are clear indicators that the path ahead for MLC is promising. While challenges lie ahead, the sport’s vibrant and diverse fanbase, coupled with growing infrastructure and investments, is bound to secure cricket’s place as a beloved sport in the United States. The future of cricket in America is bright, and Major League Cricket is set to play a significant role in its journey.",

    "body": "A sell-out crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas last week witnessed the opening match of cricket’s latest T20 league, the Major League Cricket (MLC) that is taking place in the United States.\n\nSo far, the 200-mark has been crossed twice, a side has been bowled out for 50 and the temperature has crossed the 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) barrier amid a heatwave that hit the US state.\n\nThe MLC, founded in 2019 but launched in 2023, kicked off 16 years after the inaugural T20 World Cup and 15 years after the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is now the world’s biggest domestic T20 cricket league.\n\nAs the MLC moves from Texas to North Carolina, MLC’s co-founder Sameer Mehta spoke to Al Jazeera on how the league plans to stand out among the crowd, break into the sport-heavy US market and if cricket can win American hearts.\n\nAl Jazeera: MLC is not the first T20 league and definitely won’t be the last. How do you plan on making it stand out in the crowd?\n\nSameer Mehta: From my time running Willow TV [an online subscription-based viewing service], we realised that the US is a very, very viable market for cricket. There’s a strong audience here, especially the eight million expats. Now we have immense hunger from probably the best investors in the world, we’re building our own stadiums, we’ll be playing in the summer when there’s not much cricket going on and we have the second largest salary cap in the world alongside a few other leagues.\n\nWhat we really have are the 400 million people in the US that are going to discover the sport at some point. They will fall in love with the sport. For every fan we have, if we can get one more mainstream fan to be a fan of cricket, we will be the second or third biggest market in the world. That’s the ambition.\n\nIt’s not just to run a T20 league, there are plenty of those around the world, but to be up there and the mainstream Americans to follow the sport.\n\nAl Jazeera: Mainstream Americans have plenty on their hands right now with NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS and golf, among others. How confident are you that they will take up cricket?\n\nMehta: It will take time. The Indians and the Pakistanis will be the first fans. It’s our first season. We’ve just launched. We want to make sure we get the product right this year. Our absolute goal is that next year, when we have a full season, we want to market very heavily to the mainstream American fans and make them fall in love with the sport.\n\nThis country is a country of franchise sport. Every sports fan here is used to following three, four, five franchise teams. Even in football, all the top teams are franchises. Cricket should be no different.\n\nWe don’t want to compete with them [MLB, NBA]. We want to thrive off them. Americans are obsessed about sport. When they follow a sport, they follow it grandly. In this country, where the economics, the revenue, the way sport is handled, the way broadcast rights are handled, the way players are treated, it is just mind-boggling. If we have a slice of it, I’m more than happy. I don’t need to compete with football or basketball. We have a beautiful bat-and-ball game and the T20 version is perfect for the US audience. The sky is the limit out here.\n\nAl Jazeera: T20 cricket has been around for a while. Why has it taken a long time for a league to be launched in this market?\n\nMehta: I feel like things happen at the right time. Our view was when T20 took off and built roots, it matured to a point where it has become a world-class product.\n\nWe decided to launch the league in 2017-18. It took a little bit of time to make sure the ICC and everyone else was fully on board. We also did not want to play in makeshift stadiums. We said if we’re going to do it, we’ll do it properly. I don’t think it’s been that long, there’s no urgency to it. The sport has matured, it took T20 a decade to find its feet and now it is the dominant version of cricket in the world. T20 is where the world is shifting to and as far as the US is concerned, it’s the absolute right sport for the market.\n\nAmericans like to root for a team in the place they live in. American sport is hyper-local and that’s what you want to bring to franchise cricket.\n\nAl Jazeera: MLC is now being seen as a product to help promote the sport in the US. How do you feel about that and what role should the governing body play?\n\nMehta: As I said earlier, this country is one of franchise sport. If you want to come to the US, you have to play franchise sport, otherwise the sport can go elsewhere. Here, the only way to do it is via private capital and private stadiums. The governing bodies should do what they do and should absolutely try and collaborate with us … on usage of facilities and so on for the national teams. Franchises do things differently and are willing to invest and that’s how franchise sport is so popular. Governing bodies have smaller budgets and that’s not how a sport grows in the US. Frankly, both sides need each other.\n\nIn India, Pakistan and all those countries, the governing bodies have been around for a long time and receive massive budgets. For a new country like the US, where will they get any government assistance? It won’t happen. Private capital has to do it.\n\nAl Jazeera: What’s next for the MLC then? What will it look like post season 1?\n\nMehta: We’re moving very, very fast. Next year will be a full season. Right now, we’re playing at two venues. We’re hoping to expand that to four next year which is also the Cricket World Cup year in the US. That’ll bring a lot of attention to the sport and the league. Hopefully we’ll be able to share venues with the World Cup organisers and vice versa.\n\nThe plan is for each team to have a permanent home venue by 2025 or 2026. We feel pretty confident that by 2026, each team will be applying home and away. You have got to have local fans. Once we become the top three to four financial nations in the world in terms of cricket, the cricketers will follow… and the sport will grow to a point where five to seven years from now, we can be at the top.",

    "body": "As Texan cricket tycoons go, Anurag Jain certainly cuts a more credible figure than Allen Stanford, the disgraced financier and Twenty20 promoter who notoriously landed a helicopter at Lord’s in 2008 and flaunted a crate that he claimed held $20m in cash.\n\nStanford, the flash, brash neocolonial chancer born near Waco, who sought to shape a cricketing empire from his base in Antigua, is serving a 110-year prison sentence in a Florida prison after his 2012 conviction in a Houston court for running a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.\n\nJain, meanwhile, grew up watching and playing cricket in India before moving to Dallas, starting a healthcare technology company and founding a venture capital firm with Ross Perot Jr, former owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and son of the late businessman who ran for president in the 1990s. They are investors in the Texas Super Kings, one of six Major League Cricket (MLC) teams in the inaugural tournament, which ends on Sunday with its championship match in Grand Prairie, midway between Dallas and Fort Worth.\n\n“This has been the best start-up I’ve ever done,” Jain beamed from outside a buzzy stadium suite where yellow-clad Kings fans mingled on Thursday ahead of a nine-wicket defeat to the Seattle Orcas, for whom the South African international Quinton de Kock bashed an undefeated 88.\n\nWhile Stanford came across as a Barnum with bails, the numerous wealthy and influential MLC investors, many of them of South Asian heritage and with technology backgrounds, are more modest and methodical. With an initial outlay of $120m and much infrastructure to build, this is not a get-rich-quick scheme.\n\n“We have a very clear path to where we think the league and the teams are going to be break-even and then profitable from then on … in a very realistic timeframe. We are not talking 10 years or anything like that. We would like to see that happen in the three-to-five-year horizon,” said Vijay Srinivasan, co-founder of MLC and of Willow TV, an American cricket pay-TV channel.\n\n“We are nowhere close to finishing our venues so there’s a lot of capital lined up to go into that,” he added. “This season was a short season, we do want to play a more robust home and away format so we’ll expand the league, more games, more venues.”\n\nTexas has a large South Asian population, with about half of the state’s 450,000 Indian Americans living in the Dallas area. “There is a good springboard of Indian, South Asian and Commonwealth diaspora that are here,” Jain said. “Eventually we’ll explore other markets just like soccer did in the US 30 years ago.”\n\nCrowds have been good, with several sell-outs, but MLC only used two grounds this year: the bucolic but modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, and the 7,200-capacity Grand Prairie Stadium. Finished in a rush just in time for the first game on 13 July, the converted minor league baseball stadium still bears faint traces of its past as the home of the now-defunct Texas AirHogs, from a board on a wall at the main entrance to the baseball motifs in the adjacent playground.\n\nThe Foodistaan Sports Bar & Grill looms beyond the boundary by one of the sight screens. Concessions outlets sold biryani and burgers, samosas and garlic fries. Also fried were the players, officials and few hundred fans who sizzled in the 102F (39C) heat during Thursday’s eliminator between the Washington Freedom and MI New York, which started at 3.30pm. It is absurd to hold any outdoor sporting event in Texas on a mid-afternoon in July, let alone with the region, like much of the nation, baking under a high heat warning.\n\nStill, falling in the southern hemisphere winter, the relatively quiet month allowed organizers to attract high-level talent such as De Kock, his countryman Faf du Plessis, and the Australians, Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch, as well as the West Indians, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell and Dwayne Bravo, to take the field alongside unknown domestic players.\n\nSanjay Govil, an IT entrepreneur who is the Freedom owner, said overseas players are enticed by the opportunity to spend a few weeks in the US – and by salaries that are on a par with high-grade T20 leagues around the world. England’s Jason Roy reportedly agreed a $400,000 two-year MLC deal – generous by any standards, and especially so since his contribution to the last-place Los Angeles Knight Riders this month amounted to three innings in which he scored 45, 7 and 2.\n\nMLC prepared for the tournament with a combine at a cricket complex near Houston built by an immigrant from Pakistan who made his fortune operating American fast-food franchises, and a player draft at Space Center Houston a few cover drives from mission control at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center.\n\n“I’m pleasantly surprised with all the quality of players that we’ve had, so many international stars,” said Damodhar Bhat, an India-born 42-year-old IT professional and cricket lover who travelled from Seattle with his son to watch Thursday’s doubleheader. “This looks very promising. I really wish it sticks around and hope that it does.”\n\nFor now, Grand Prairie is a temple where MLC preaches to the converted, but the 2024 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting with the West Indies, is an opportunity to promote the gospel. So too, above all, is the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, should cricket join the slate of sports.\n\nIf summers broiled by climate change are a challenge, another defining aspect of modern life, globalization, is an opportunity. “I do this ‘poll’, whenever I’m in an Uber, taxi, car, whatever. I’ve never heard of anybody who’s not heard of cricket. It’s a very connected world,” said Govil above the hum of an air-conditioning unit, pausing to stand for a rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner, hand over heart.\n\n“I think there’s going to be a huge evolution in how cricket is going to be played in the future. We had failed attempts with Kerry Packer and West Indies and so on and so forth. But I think the game has evolved a lot more and there’s a lot more commercial interest now thanks to the IPL and other leagues like The Hundred and the Big Bash.”\n\nIt is only 20 years since the T20 format debuted professionally in England and fifteen since the Indian Premier League was born. “The game has changed. The game has become shorter, faster, funner,” Jain said. “People like action … Offense, defense, all the time.”\n\nIt’s also created a more democratic environment; or at least a more capitalistic one. “You don’t have to be the best Test-playing country to be seen as a player on the global landscape,” Srinivasan said. “If you can put together a high-quality T20 tournament with the best players in the world and the highest standards then there’s a place for you.”\n\nWillow TV has broadcast games in the US along with the CBS Sports Network, with several other countries also airing live contests. High-end production values have included slick graphics and a range of camera angles. The former India great Sunil Gavaskar, one of the television commentators, examined the pitch on Thursday wearing a cowboy hat.\n\nTexas now has a cricket team named after the Chennai Super Kings, an IPL team based nearly 10,000 miles away. It might be a dubious branding decision in a place that had a distinctly strained relationship with its last monarch. But perhaps it’s not so odd in the broader context.\n\nCulture clash is not the right phrase for what’s happening in Major League Cricket. This is not a collision. It’s a combination. A blending, the logical outcome of modern media and mass migration, horizons widening as technology erodes boundaries.\n\nA post-pandemic backlash against globalism is impacting how the world creates and consumes all kinds of stuff. But not in sports, where the international TV and digital content supply chains remain sturdy, market forces rule, workers are peripatetic and power and profits are increasingly interconnected across frontiers. After all, earlier in the week, North American-owned Wrexham played North American-owned Manchester United in San Diego and Saudi Arabia (its world golf conquest ongoing) signed Liverpool’s captain.\n\nFour MLC teams are tied to IPL entities while the other two partnered with Australian regional federations. Sports gambling is illegal in Texas, among other states, but, underlining the importance of overseas viewers, an international online betting company is a major sponsor of the league.\n\n“Whatever we do, whoever the owners are, ultimately this is an American league, it’s an American product,” Jain insisted, pointing out that matches were timed to appeal to US prime-time viewers.\n\n“Our line-ups, all of them have a strong US domestic component, so this is a platform for growing American cricket in all respects. This is not meant to be anything other than that,” Srinivasan said. “We’re adding more venues. Increasing the standard of the domestic US pool. Some US players have had significant match-changing performances in this tournament which is a good thing, I think. What we’ll see is that’s going to lead to a more competitive US team like the IPL did for the domestic Indian player pool.”\n\nOverall, he argued, MLC is “truly what the US is – it’s an amalgamation of a lot of things. I think that’s the identity of our league.”",

High risk shot as he tries to reverse scoop it and Haris makes a vociferous appeal for an lbw and the umpire is convinced. Gous has sent it upstairs for a second opinion. Fair delivery. Splayed his front foot out to create room for the scoop but got rapped on the pads. Nothing on the sincko. Pitching outside off, impact in line and it's umpire's call, just clipping the leg stump. Unicorns draws first blood! Probably the shot wasn't on when facing Haris who is spearing his thunderbolts. 28 / 1\n\n5.1 to GD Phillips , Now that's a stunning yorker! Pace is pace yaar! Off stump goes cartwheeling. He is too hot handle, rams a heat-seeking yorker on off and Phillips goes without troubling the scorer. He tried to jam the bat down but he was a touch late and the furniture was already disturbed. Excellent execution and what a fiery celebration to follow. 30 / 3\n\n5.6 to Mukhtar Ahmed , What is going on? WF in a huge spot of bother as Mukhtar Ahmed lobs one straight to mid-off where Stoinis takes an easy catch comfortably, reverse cupping as the ball descended on him. Exceptional over from the Pakistan quick! Just launched the ball straight into the hands of the fielder, pitched up at a searing pace on off and he couldn't get much elevation and power behind that shot, couldn't get up and over the fielder. 33 / 4\n\n13.5 to AJ Hosein , Climbing through from back of a length, slow and slammed into the surface; he steps away outside leg stump and tries to get on top of it, doesn't have much pace to work with and despite generating quite a lot power behind that shot, he couldn't clear Anderson at wide long-on and has to go!. 82 / 6\n\n17.1 to AJ Pienaar , Short of a length on fifth stump line, picked he length quickly and lofts it high into the air but didn't get all of it, Allen at long-on takes a stupendous catch, safe as a house. 109 / 7",

    "date": "Thu Sep 28 21:38:53 2023",
    "body": "Despite the sport long being popular in the Chicago area, none of the original MLC cities are in or even near the Midwest. As the league stands now, the teams are based in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe league is still finding its footing and is unlikely to announce any new teams in the immediate future, but expansion is the ultimate goal for MLC — and Chicago is ripe to host a team.\n\n\"There are definitely some really strong markets for cricket in the U.S. that we don't currently have a team for, and Chicago is certainly high on that list given the size of the market and the demographics,\" said Tom Dunmore, MLC's vice president of marketing. \"Chicago certainly has a lot of the strong characteristics for a major-league cricket team in the future. It's a really good potential market; all the metrics support it.\"\n\nThat ripeness is in large part thanks to the city's strong overseas immigrant population. The sport originated in England but has since become dominant in other Commonwealth countries. The Indian Premier League, for example, is now home to the most elite level of play.\n\n\"Cricket is a sport driven a lot in the U.S. by immigration from South Asia, particularly,\" Dunmore said. \"That's where the sport is most popular — in India, in Pakistan and so forth.\"\n\nThose migration trends were front of mind for the league as it scouted the original U.S. host cities and will remain a factor in future expansion efforts, therefore making Chicago an appealing contender as an expansion city.\n\n\"We are looking at the top 10 markets for cricket in the country, and that's driven a lot by the patterns of immigration,\" Dunmore said. \"Teams are going to be based in big cities, big metro areas with big South Asian populations. We think they are going to be very successful in those cities.\"\n\nThe league has already seen early signs of success. The inaugural tournament in July saw packed crowds at the league's new stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\n\"What we showed this summer by building a stadium and then selling it out for most of the matches is that fans will come and watch it,\" Dunmore said. \"The desire for tickets was really beyond what we could serve during the tournament, so the tournament has shown that there is a market for it.\"\n\nThe new league is filling a void in the U.S. cricket community, which has long lacked professional-level play. \"They have not had a domestic league to support or stadiums to go to,\" Dunmore said.\n\nLeaders in the Chicago cricket community see the professional league as an opportunity to rally the city around the sport. \"That's the ultimate goal,\" said longtime local resident Fazale Haq, a board member for the Midwest Cricket Conference. \"We want to provide the grassroots for the league.\"\n\nChicago has a long history of both recreational and minor-league cricket play. Matches have been held at Washington Park on the city's South Side since the 1930s, and the park's four fields remain some of the most popular grounds to play in the area. Still, the sport has yet to break into the broader Chicago market.\n\nHaq sees the professional game as something that can transform the sport into a spectacle that even non-players enjoy.\n\n\"Right now, cricket is player-focused,\" he said. \"As soon as we transition that into an entertainment stage, I think that will change the game. It's not about cricketers watching other cricketers play. It's about casual mom and dad coming in and paying for it.\"",

    "body": "Surrey 'disappointed and frustrated' as allrounder opts against 9000-mile round trip from USA\n\n1:12\n\nPollard: Narine needed a private jet to make Blast Finals Day\n\nSurrey were \"disappointed and frustrated\" to learn late on Wednesday evening that Sunil Narine has ruled himself out of Vitality Blast Finals Day on Saturday, abandoning a planned 9,000-mile round trip from Dallas to Birmingham.\n\nESPNcricinfo revealed on Tuesday that Surrey were expecting Narine to return from his Major League Cricket (MLC) commitments with LA Knight Riders in order to play for them this weekend, before returning to Dallas immediately after Finals Day at Edgbaston.\n\nBut the club said in a statement on Thursday that they had been informed on Wednesday night about a change in Narine's plans. Narine will instead remain in the USA, leaving Surrey with only one overseas player for Saturday's showpiece in Australia's Sean Abbott.\n\nAlec Stewart, Surrey's director of cricket, said: \"We were aware when we signed Sunil for the T20 Blast that he could be unavailable for Finals Day due to his pre-signed contract with the Knight Riders in the MLC.\n\nRelated\n\nSomerset keep faith in process in bid to end Finals Day pain\n\nPepper adds the spice in enterprising Essex's title charge\n\nSunil Narine's mission impossible: 75 hours, two continents, four games\n\nMLC wants more England cricketers, but not to 'start a war with anyone'\n\nSteven Smith in contention for Major League Cricket action in 2024\n\n\"However, all of the subsequent conversations with the various parties since he arrived for the group games and leading into this week were that we would have him back for Saturday, so it's disappointing and frustrating to lose a player of Sunil's quality at such late notice.\"\n\nKieron Pollard, Narine's long-time team-mate and close friend, jokingly suggested to ESPNcricinfo that Surrey - the county he represented last year, alongside Narine - should have laid on a private jet to ensure his availability.\n\n\"Maybe they should have sent some private jets for him, make him comfortable and then he might have been able to do it pretty comfortably!\" Pollard said. \"It's totally up to the individual how you plan out your contracts, because there are going to be tournaments that are overlapping.\"\n\nECB regulations require players to be registered with a county in the group stages of a competition in order to be available for the knockout stages, so Surrey will not be permitted an overseas replacement for Narine.\n\nDan Moriarty, their left-arm spinner, played his first Blast game of the season in their quarter-final victory over Lancashire and will likely retain his spot. Cam Steel, the legspinning allrounder, is the closest thing Surrey have to a like-for-like replacement for Narine, while Dan Worrall and Jordan Clark may also come into contention.\n\n\"I genuinely think it's a wonderful opportunity,\" Gareth Batty, Surrey's coach, told ESPNcricinfo. \"We've got a great squad. The worst part of my job is telling very fine players that they're not playing. I hate it. It is the worst thing. It's another opportunity to tell someone that they are playing.\n\n\"I truly believe that we have lots of people that can play at any point across any competition and be a real success. Obviously Sunny is a wonderful player, but we'll have a wonderful player coming in.\"\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",

    "body": "The inaugural edition, which featured six teams - Seattle Orcas, MI New York, Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom, Sanfrancisco Unicorns, and Los Angeles Knight Riders - saw packed houses, huge interests and swelled-up viewership, prompting the organisers to dream bigger.\n\nHT launches Crick-it, a one stop destination to catch Cricket, anytime, anywhere. Explore now!\n\nThat the final will be played in front of a full house was expected but the kind of crowd that gathered in Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas during the league games, took everyone by surprise. Over the course of the nine match days at the venue, it was 80% to its capacity on average every day, while the Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina saw a sell-out in its six match days.\n\nIt means that more than 70,000 spectators saw season one of MLC, bringing in $2.8 million in ticket sales revenue. This is an astounding amount for any match played on US soil, excluding India's regular trips to Lauderhill to play T20 Internationals against the West Indies.\n\nCricket's popularity in the world\n\nSports entrepreneur and investor, Joe Pompliano in his podcast ‘The Joe Pomp Show’, termed cricket as the second-most followed sport in the world. Pompliano said cricket, with 2.5 billion fans worldwide, is only behind football in terms of global popularity. To add more context to his numbers, he compared the Instagram followers of star India batter Virat Kohli with leading sportspersons across the globe.\n\n\"For context on how big cricket is outside the US: Virat Kohli has 256 million Instagram followers, which is more than LeBron James, Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Shohei Ohtani, Patrick Mahomes, and Tiger Woods....combined,\" he said.\n\nShohei Ohtani, the current heartthrob of USA baseball fans, has only 6 million followers.\n\nBig market for cricket in the USA\n\nQuoting data from a report, Pompliano added that India is the biggest market for cricket with close to 550 million people engaging with the sport annually. As astonishing as this may sound, there are no other full member nations in the top five apart from India. The data says China is the second-biggest market for cricket with 408 million people showing interest in cricket annually while the USA is third on the list with 63 million interested in cricket per year.\n\nDespite near-zero participation in ICC tournaments, such a high demand for cricket in the USA comes largely from its immigration population mainly from cricket-crazy countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Singapore. This huge interest was one of the primary reasons behind MLC's birth. Big investors saw an opportunity to cash in on the craze.\n\n\"A group of investors that includes the CEOs of Microsoft and Adobe has raised $120 million to build Major League Cricket in the United States,\" said Pompliano.\n\nReports state that this could just be the beginning of what could turn out to be the biggest sporting league in the USA. The rousing success of the first edition of the MLC has already given rise to the organisers considering bigger stadiums in New York and Los Angeles. According to an ESPNCricinfo report, MLC could collaborate with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to build a 34,000-seat pop-up venue in New York City at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bron.\n\nIf that proposal gets the greenlight then It could be one of the three venues for next year's ICC T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by USA and West Indies.\n\nAnother major factor going in MLC's favour is the fact that the USA Cricket Association has given sole rights to MLC to host professional cricket tournaments in the country. That means MLC organisers have a monopoly and they can be the biggest channel between USACA and ICC to take the game to new heights.",

    "date": "Thu May 25 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Jason Roy will become the first current England player to sign up for the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) competition in the US after forfeiting the final months of his contract with the ECB, having first secured reassurance that the move will not endanger his chances of international selection. Roy has been offered a two-year deal by Los Angeles Knight Riders and will travel to the US at the end of Surrey’s T20 Blast campaign.\n\n“I hope to play for England for many more years, that remains my priority,” Roy wrote in a statement. “It benefits me as an England player to play as much competitive cricket as possible. Just to be clear, my priority is England cricket, especially with a World Cup soon upon us.”\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders share ownership with Kolkata Knight Riders, the Indian Premier League franchise for whom Roy played this season. Though the MLC schedule has not yet been released he could play as many games for their teams this year as he will for Surrey, which would represent a significant step on the much-discussed path towards year-round franchise contracts.\n\nHis county, however, expect to retain his primary allegiance and if they qualify for the Blast’s finals day, which will be played two days after the start of the MLC on 15 July, his departure would be delayed. The MLC Twenty20 competition is due to end on 30 July, two days before the start of the Hundred and three before Roy would be due at Lord’s to play his first game for Oval Invincibles.\n\nNo England-qualified player can play in a foreign league without being issued with a no-objection certificate by the ECB, and after what Roy described as “clear and supportive conversations” with the governing body it was happy to oblige. In a statement the ECB said it did so “on the proviso that he gives up the remainder of his incremental contract”, and that it has “absolute confidence and faith that Jason is committed to England cricket”.\n\nRoy is not the only player on an ECB contract to have been contacted by MLC teams. David Willey has so far turned down approaches, not wanting to jeopardise his potential involvement in this autumn’s 50-over World Cup, while Reece Topley has also been sounded out, but is recovering from the dislocated shoulder that ruled him out of the IPL. Having missed much of the last year through various injuries Topley is keen to play as much cricket as possible for whichever teams want to have him, but will need to prove his fitness before making any new commitments.\n\nRoy, 32, has become a key player for England’s white-ball sides since his debut in 2014, and was part of the team that won the 50-over World Cup in 2019. But after a miserable summer last year he was dropped from the T20 squad for the World Cup in Australia, which England also won, and downgraded from a full central contract to an incremental contract.\n\nThese deals are worth about £70,000 and are intended for “players who may feature for England on a less predictable basis”. They are considerably less lucrative than the rumoured £300,000 Roy has been offered for perhaps as little as five weeks’ work, split over two years, in the US.\n\nNone of those on full central contracts with the ECB are expected to play in the MLC this year – the competition also clashes with the last two Ashes Tests – and though several high-profile white-ball specialists from other countries have already signed up, including Quinton de Kock, Glenn Phillips and Wanindu Hasaranga, many more will wait to see if the debut season is a success before deciding whether to get involved.\n\nThough the inaugural competition will last only 17 days and clash with only one day of senior white-ball cricket in England it is expected to expand into August from 2024, forcing players to choose between it and the Hundred.",

    "body": "Other England players, including Reece Topley, are also weighing up the merits of the move\n\n2:35\n\nRoy contract termination a significant moment for cricket\n\nEngland white-ball players are negotiating releases from their ECB contracts in order to take up lucrative offers to play in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States.\n\nEnglish players on full central contracts are unlikely to feature in MLC this year but Jason Roy - who holds an incremental deal with the ECB - has confirmed plans to terminate his contract in order to play in the league.\n\nIn a statement, the ECB said: \"England men's white-ball batter Jason Roy has informed the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he wishes to take up an agreement with Major League Cricket in the USA later this summer. The ECB have agreed for him to play in the competition on the proviso that he gives up the remainder of his ECB incremental contract, which both parties have agreed to.\n\n\"The ECB wish to clarify that this decision will not affect Jason's selection for England teams going forward. We have absolute confidence and faith that Jason is committed to England cricket.\"\n\nReece Topley, Roy's Surrey and England team-mate, is weighing up the merits of the same move, though his decision may depend on his fitness status after shoulder surgery last month.\n\nRelated\n\nKieron Pollard: 'A lot of people are sprinting through those franchise doors'\n\nRussell, Narine, Roy and Ferguson join Knight Riders in Los Angeles for MLC\n\nWasim Khan: International cricket must find a way to 'co-exist' with T20 leagues\n\nMcCullum: 'Naive' to think players would turn down franchise deals\n\nBoult: 'It felt bizarre to have a Test on down the road and not play in it'\n\nMLC is due to take place from July 13-30 at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and has significant backing from both India and Australia: four of the six franchises have investors who own IPL teams, while Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales have stakes in the other two.\n\nThe league's inaugural season features a minor clash with the English summer: the semi-finals and finals of the T20 Blast take place on July 15, while there are two rounds of County Championship fixtures between Finals Day and the start of the Hundred on August 1. But there are concerns within the English game that MLC is likely to expand in future and could clash directly with the Hundred.\n\nAs a result, the ECB will not give No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) that would enable contracted players to feature in MLC. And while players are unlikely to negotiate a release from full white-ball contracts to play in the US, such a move would make financial sense for those on incremental deals.\n\nThe ECB incremental contracts are worth around £66,000 per year and effectively act as a top-up to county salaries. Six players have such deals for the 2022-23 contract cycle: Harry Brook, Dawid Malan, Matthew Potts, Roy, Topley and David Willey.\n\nESPNcricinfo understands that Surrey are expecting Roy to play MLC - most likely for LA Knight Riders - between the end of their Blast season and the start of the Hundred, and that he would have to agree a release from his incremental contract to do so. If Surrey reach Finals Day, Roy will be available for them and miss the start of MLC.\n\nRoy played for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2023 and is understood to have held informal discussions with the franchise about the possibility of a contract to play for their teams in other leagues, including MLC. His representative declined to comment.\n\nTopley has not signed a deal to play in MLC but is also understood to be considering his options. After leaving the IPL early with a shoulder injury, he underwent surgery last month and his contractual decisions will depend in part on the progress of his rehabilitation.\n\nTopley outlined his white-ball ambitions on Surrey's live stream last week: \"If you'd have asked me when I was young, I'd have said I'd love to play 100 Tests for England,\" he said. \"Now, if you asked me, [I'd say] I'd love to go to as many IPLs as I can. I don't think the stigma around saying you want to play and be successful in white-ball cricket is that bad.\"\n\nEngland contracts run from October to September, so requesting a release from an incremental deal at this stage of the year would cost players around £20,000. Each MLC franchise has a purse of $1.15 million (£930,000 approx.) - to cover between 16 and 19 players, of which nine can be from overseas - so any deals would offset the loss of earnings from leaving an England contract.\n\nThe ECB is in the process of revamping its central contract system for the 2023-24 season to adapt to the growth of franchise leagues, and any decisions to leave incremental contracts will not be held against players in selection moving forward.\n\nFollowing other reports in various media outlets on Thursday, Roy issued a statement on his social media accounts which said: \"Following a bit of unwanted speculation over the last 24 hours, I wanted to clarify that I am not and never will 'walk away from England'.\n\n\"Representing my country continues to be my proudest moment as a professional cricketer. I hope to play for England for many more years, that remains my priority.\n\n\"I've had clear and supportive conversations with the ECB about participating in Major League Cricket. The ECB were happy with me to play in the competition as long as they didn't have to pay me for the remainder of the contractual year.\n\n\"As a single format player with no central contract I wanted to take the opportunity to play this competition as there are currently no scheduling conflicts with England. It benefits me as an England player to play as much competitive cricket as possible.\n\n\"Just to be very clear, my priority is England cricket, especially with a World Cup soon upon us. It is for me, and for any player, the greatest honour to receive a cap to play for their country.\"\n\nA Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) spokesperson told ESPNcricinfo: \"This is covered by the comprehensive standard playing contract agreed by the ECB, counties and the PCA. It is completely at the employers' discretion whether players are issued an NOC in-season.\"\n\nSeveral leading T20 players including Marcus Stoinis, Quinton de Kock, Wanindu Hasaranga, Anrich Nortje and Glenn Phillips have already been unveiled as overseas signings in MLC, with Trent Boult and Adam Zampa expected to join them in the coming weeks.\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",

    "body": "By 7.30pm in Grand Prairie, when Ali Khan set off on his run-up, temperatures in this corner of Texas hovered around 102 degrees. A warm breeze blew across the ground but there was barely a cloud in the sky or a patch of green on the wicket. Ideal batting conditions, all told.\n\nNot that Khan – opening for the LA Knight Riders – would have thrown the ball to anyone else. This was a moment to cherish for the USA star. He was tasked with bowling the first ball of Major League Cricket: this country's newest professional sports league and this sport's latest attempt to break America.\n\n'A giant leap across the Atlantic,' broadcasters called it. 'Cricket's American dream'.\n\nNo pressure, then. And so Devon Conway – of New Zealand and the Texas Super Kings – waited as Khan sent the ball into the pitch and towards the unknown.\n\nThe fast bowler believes that, in time, this T20 tournament will trail only the Indian Premier League.\n\nThe next two and half weeks should tell us if he is on to something. Or seduced by blind faith.\n\nThis was the first of 19 games split between this converted baseball ground near Dallas and a 3,000-seater stadium in North Carolina.\n\nDeep pockets and grand plans mean top international talent is spread across the six teams – the Knight Riders, the Super Kings, the Seattle Orcas, the San Francisco Unicorns, Washington Freedom and MI New York. Jason Roy gave up his England contract to come over. Liam Plunkett is here, too.\n\nAlso among the foreign legion are South Africa's Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada, Australia's Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa and Aaron Finch and West Indians Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell.\n\nThey will line up alongside local talent such as Pakistan-born Khan. Around 6,000 fans flocked here on Thursday night, including Sri Lanka legend Mahela Jayawardene. Organizers reckon they could have flogged a few thousand more.\n\nBut it was a sell-out and a terrific atmosphere. 'T-S-K, T-S-K' rang out even before half centuries from Conway and David Miller fired the Super Kings to 181/6. In response, South African-American Rusty Theron helped reduce the Knight Riders to 7-3.\n\nRussell led a fightback, hitting 10 boundaries and sending one out of the stadium. It was all in vain as the Super Kings won by 69 runs to send yellow flags waving into the Texas sky, and crown an opening night flush with promise.\n\nBack in March, when Major League Cricket gathered for its swanky draft four hours south of here, the symbolism was obvious. They chose the NASA space center in Houston for a reason. But will the next fortnight really mark lift-off for cricket on this vast frontier. Or just another false dawn? Another of what Elon Musk might term a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'.\n\nBecause we have been here before. Recent decades have seen several botched attempts to break America. The first incarnation of Major League Cricket – founded in 2000 – barely got off the ground.\n\nNo wonder organizers of this venture admit to having doubts.\n\nBut they have at least given themselves solid foundations. As well as an impressive cast of imports, Major League Cricket have enlisted some serious backers - both financial and cricketing.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is among several Silicon Valley types pumping in money, while IPL owners have stakes in four of the six teams. The other two are supported by Australian state bodies.\n\nThose close ties could lure stars such as Australian Steve Smith over in the future.\n\nBut organizers can't afford this to become just another T20 Tournament in an already crammed field. They know that the cricket must sell itself. And they know they have to lean on their surroundings.\n\nHence the pre-game pageantry and aerial acrobatics: they want to combine American glitz with cricketing guile.\n\nOn Thursday night, though, Grand Prairie was laced with South Asian flavor.\n\nFans were given a free flag and whistle on entry. Some wore Stetsons. Many more wore shirts carrying the names of IPL teams and Indian stars such as MS Dhoni. Stalls around the ground, meanwhile, were supplied by Foodistaan, a local Indian restaurant.\n\nIndian expats offer this tournament an immediate support base and the plan was to target 'low-hanging fruit' – existing cricket fans – first. For this to last, however, for MLC to attract more overseas stars, for cricket to even dream of rubbing shoulders with baseball – America's Pastime - new fans will have to come. Preferably before next year, when the US will co-host the T20 World Cup.\n\nThis opening night came had its teething problems – a few loose shots and dropped catches and a half-time drone show that fell victim to technical glitches.\n\nBut it ended with fireworks, after Miller, Russell and Co had provided plenty of pyrotechnics.\n\nNow we wait. To see if cricket lights up America at last, or fizzles into the dark once more.",

He was subsequently announced as the captain.[6] Corey Anderson, Liam Plunkett, Tajinder Singh and Smit Patel were prominent names picked in the domestic round of the draft; Marcus Stoinis was also announced as another overseas signing by the Unicorns.[7] In May 2023, the team announced direct signing of South African pacer, Lungi Ngidi.[8] On 20 June 2023, Unicorns announced former Australian all-rounder Shane Watson as their head coach for the 2023 season.[9]\n\nThe team finished fifth in the tournament, winning just two of their five league matches.[10] They were tied on points with the MI New York, but could not advance to the play-offs due to their negative net run arte.\n\nCurrent squad[edit]\n\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns roster Position Name Nationality[a] Date of birth (age) Batting style Bowling style Year signed Notes Batters Finn Allen New Zealand (1999-04-22) April 22, 1999 (age 25) Right-handed Right-arm off-break 2023 Direct signing Matthew Short Australia (1995-11-08) November 8, 1995 (age 28) Right-handed Right-arm off-break 2024 Direct signing Jake Fraser-McGurk Australia (2002-04-11) April 11, 2002 (age 22) Right-handed Right-arm leg break 2024 Direct signing All-rounders Corey Anderson New Zealand (1990-12-13) December 13, 1990 (age 33) Left-handed Left-arm medium-fast 2023 Karima Gore United States (1998-06-25) June 25, 1998 (age 25) Right-handed Slow left-arm orthodox 2024 Sanjay Krishnamurthi United States (2003-06-02) June 2, 2003 (age 20) Right-handed Slow left-arm orthodox 2023 U23 player Tajinder Singh India (1992-05-25) May 25, 1992 (age 31) Right-handed Right-arm off-break 2024 Released and re-drafted in 2024 Wicket-keepers Jahmar Hamilton West Indies (1990-09-22) September 22, 1990 (age 33) Right-handed — 2024 Bowlers Brody Couch Australia (1999-12-05) December 5, 1999 (age 24) Left-handed Right-arm medium 2023 Carmi le Roux South Africa (1993-03-30) March 30, 1993 (age 31) Right-handed Left-arm medium-fast 2023 Hassan Khan Pakistan (1998-10-16) October 16, 1998 (age 25) Right-handed Slow left-arm orthodox 2024 Liam Plunkett England (1985-04-06) April 6, 1985 (age 39) Right-handed Right-arm fast 2023 Haris Rauf Pakistan (1993-11-07) November 7, 1993 (age 30) Right-handed Right-arm fast 2023 Direct signing Matt Henry New Zealand (1991-12-14) 14 December 1991 (age 32) Right-handed Right-arm fast 2024 Direct signing\n\nAdministration and support staff[edit]\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns staff Position Name Head coach Shane Watson Assistant coach Assistant coach Team manager Strength and conditioning High performance analyst Physiotherapist\n\nSeasons[edit]\n\nSeasons[edit]\n\nYear League standing Final standing 2023 5th out of 6 League stage\n\nC: champions\n\nRU: runner-up\n\nSF team qualified for the semi-final stage of the competition\n\nSeason summary[edit]\n\nYear Played Wins Losses Tied/NR 2023 5 2 3 0 Source: ESPNCricinfo[11]\n\nNote:\n\nNR indicates No result.\n\nAbandoned matches are indicated as no result.\n\nNotes[edit]",

    "date": "Thu Aug 10 18:02:34 2023",
    "body": "On 13th July 2023, cricket enthusiasts in the United States geared up for an exciting transformation in the world of sports as Major League Cricket (MLC) took its first step onto the American stage. Major League Cricket hosted its first game at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas after a few false dawns. This time around it got major support from tech and celebrity investors along with big franchises coming in to play for different cities. The tournament is in a round robin format with 6 participating teams. Four out of 6 teams are owned by business entities which already own teams in other leagues like IPL and others have investor names like Satya Nadella and Shantanu Narayen.\n\nCricket leagues have seen immense growth across the world. IPL which was started in 2008 and now has the second most viewership just behind NFL. The success of these leagues is directly correlated with the fan engagement as more fans leads to more viewership which leads to more sponsors which leads to more investments in the league. MLC being at such an embryonic stage has the potential to disrupt the US market with the right use data and analytics to boost fan engagement.\n\nThe convergence of technology and sports has given rise to a data revolution in recent years. Leagues worldwide are embracing analytics to gain crucial insights into player performance, fan behavior, and overall game dynamics. IPL teams use metrics like Most Valuable Player Index (MVPI) to identify the finest players. This index is a weighted composite score of the different attributes of a player, including hard-hitting ability, finishing ability, consistency, and running between the wickets for batsmen, and economy, wicket-taking ability, consistency, and crucial wicket-taking ability for bowlers. In 2014, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) hired a data analysis company to analyze data and develop strategies for the team. Using this analysis, KKR won the trophy that year, demonstrating the effectiveness of data analytics in IPL.\n\nOpportunities exist for growing leagues such as the MLC to leverage data & analytics to enhance the fan engagements and improve the quality of the game in the following ways:\n\n1) Targeted Marketing and Communication: Understanding fan demographics and behavior will enable growing leagues to develop targeted marketing campaigns. This will ensure they market it to the right audiences which will increase chances of fan conversion and retention.\n\n2) Enhanced In-Stadium Experiences: With help of data analytics growing sports leagues can provide fans truly immersive experiences. From optimized seating to interactive engagement zones.\n\n3) Optimized Pricing Strategies: Leagues can use data to study pricing analytics and the growth and demand of the game to reach optimized prices for their tickets.\n\n4) Performance Analysis & Team Development: Teams can use data to scout for talent for the drafts and even analyze their own players and develop them in the right areas.\n\n5) Winning Strategies: Data can help design strategies that can help teams take a certain approach to the game that results into a win.\n\n6) Fantasy Cricket Leagues: Capitalizing on the growing popularity of fantasy sports, growing leagues can offer fans opportunity to participate in fantasy cricket leagues.\n\nBig sports league across the world has taken these analytics initiative to grow. NFL partnered with AWS to implement cloud-based data strategy that uses analytics, ML and AI to gain a deeper understanding of every aspect of the game and build a better football experience for fans, players and teams. NFL has used data to make 50 rule changes to reduce risk of injuries to players which is a major concern in the sport. NFL uses Amazon QuickSight that quickly builds customizable and interactive dashboards which results in better fan engagement. In MLB we have seen Boston Red Sox winning 4 championships after hiring Tim Tippett who designed prototype for teams’ analytical program. That’s not winning one since 1918. NBA has seen the game change so much since analytics backed up that a 3 pointer is a better shot to take that a 2 pointer.\n\nThe entry of MLC into the American sports landscape holds immense promise for the country’s sports industry. Cricket once considered a niche sport in the USA, now has an opportunity to carve its place alongside more established sports like basketball, baseball and football. As MLC makes its debut on the USA soil, embracing the potential of data and analytics emerges as a key consideration for coming years, aiding them in solidifying their presence on the world's grandest sports stage. Drawing inspirations from the successes of leagues like IPL and NFL, MLC has an opportunity to build a strong bond between cricket and American fans through personalized experiences, targeted marketing and data driven strategies.\n\n#MLC #sports #sportsanalytics #analytics #sportsbusiness #AI #texassuperkings\n\nReferences:\n\n1) How Data Analytics Have Changed Baseball Forever (montclair.edu)\n\n2) Fueling the future of sports: How the NFL is using data to change the game–on the field, in the stands, and in your home | TechCrunch\n\n3) Major League Cricket is selling out every game and it’s already a massive success - SBNation.com\n\n4) Major League Cricket: Why USA T20 league could rival biggest franchise tournaments - BBC Sport\n\n5) NBA Data Analytics: Changing the Game | by Nabil M Abbas | Towards Data Science\n\n6) The Winning Formula: Data Science and Sports Analytics in the IPL (linkedin.com)",

I don’t know what the Australian calendar is next year but I believe there is enough space for him to potentially play.”\n\nMehta also said Smith will play an active role in the tournament in the future as he said,“Long-term … our view is that we might see a lot of him in the US.”\n\nSmith himself in September last year said, “There’s obviously leagues popping up everywhere around the world now, and I think you’ll probably see more players in the back end of their career going down that route, so it’s potentially something I’ll look at in the future.”\n\n“The US has been a market that cricket’s been trying to get into for some time. So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes,” he added.\n\nHowever, Smith cannot participate in this year’s competition as Australia will tour England for the five-match Test series for the Ashes. In 2024 after the T20 World Cup which is also to be hosted in the USA along with West Indies Smith will have a window to play in the league.\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC is all set to start on the 13th of July this year in Texas and the league is estimated to be worth 174 million Australian dollars.\n\nEach of the six franchises is based in San Francisco, Dallas, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Seattle and New York City the teams will have a $1.5 million salary cap and can secure 18 players, with a maximum of seven overseas players.",

    "date": "Wed Jul 19 03:22:02 2023",
    "body": "As the sun sets on traditional American sports, a new dawn beckons - Cricket. The ripples of excitement for Major League Cricket (MLC) are spreading far and wide, promising to revolutionise the American sports landscape. This quintessentially British game, with a rich tapestry of tradition, is poised to make a grand entry into the heart of America, aiming to captivate audiences with its unique blend of strategy, skill, and suspense. The key question remains: Will Major League Cricket hit a sixer in the American sports industry, or will it be caught out? Read and explore the potential of this new entrant and discuss a little bit more about this American Venture.\n\nHistory of Cricket in America\n\nThough not widely recognized as an American sport today, cricket has a rich history in the United States. In the early 1700s, it was brought to the American shores by English colonists. By the mid-1800s, cricket was a well-established sport in America, with Philadelphia being the hub of American cricket. The USA and Canada played in the first-ever international cricket match in 1844.\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nMajor League Cricket is an ambitious project launched by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in partnership with USA Cricket. The goal is to establish a professional T20 cricket league in the United States, showcasing the best of cricket to the American audience. The inaugural season took place on July 13 2023 and will be concluded on July 30 2023.\n\nACE has made significant strides in developing infrastructure for cricket in America. They've taken over the management of a baseball stadium in Texas, which will be refurbished into a dedicated cricketing venue. Furthermore, ACE has plans to build additional stadiums and training facilities across the country. The league is expected to provide a platform for American cricketers to showcase their skills and help raise the standard of cricket in the country.\n\nMajor League Cricket Teams\n\nThere are six teams set to lock horns with each other. Those are Texas Super Kings, Seattle Orcas, MI New York, Washington Freedom, San Francisco Unicorns, and Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nClick here to get the full fixture –MLC 2023\n\nThe Potential of Major League Cricket in America\n\nThe potential for cricket in America is immense. The United States is a melting pot of cultures with a large immigrant population from cricket-loving countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Caribbean. This provides a ready fan base for cricket.\n\nMoreover, the T20 format of it is likely to appeal to the American audience. It's a shorter, more dynamic version of cricket, packed with action. It's similar to baseball in terms of duration and pace, making it easier for Americans to understand and enjoy.\n\nThe commercial potential of MLC is also significant. The American sports market is one of the most lucrative in the world. If it succeeds in capturing even a fraction of this market, it could spur phenomenal growth for cricket.\n\nThe Future of Major League Cricket\n\nThe future of it largely depends on its execution. If done right, MLC could revolutionise the American sports landscape. It could provide a fresh alternative to traditional American sports, offering a unique blend of strategy, skill, and suspense.\n\nThe key to MLC's success will be to build a strong connection with the American audience. This means investing in grassroots development, promoting the sport in schools and colleges, and creating opportunities for young Americans to take up cricket.\n\nFurthermore, MLC will need to leverage its diverse fan base, catering to both traditional American sports fans and immigrants from cricket-loving nations. Strategic marketing, exciting gameplay, and engaging fan experiences will be critical in attracting and retaining fans.\n\nCan Major League Cricket Become America's Next Big Thing?\n\nThe question of whether MLC can become America's next big thing is intriguing. There's potential for sure. The United States is a sports-loving nation with a diverse population and a lucrative sports market. The T20 format of MLC, with its fast pace and high action, could potentially resonate with the American audience.\n\nHowever, turning potential into reality is not going to be easy. It faces stiff competition from established sports. It will need to overcome numerous challenges, from building awareness and interest in cricket, to fostering local talent and competing for viewership and sponsorship deals.\n\nYet, the journey of soccer in America provides hope. Once a fringe sport, soccer has grown tremendously over the past few decades, thanks in large part to the success of Major League Soccer. If MLC can replicate this success, cricket could indeed become America's next big thing.\n\nConclusion: MLC is Ready to Make History\n\nMajor League Cricket has the potential to revolutionise the American sports landscape, offering a fresh alternative to traditional sports. The stage is set, the players are already on the pitch, and the cricketing world watches with bated breath. Will MLC hit a sixer in the American sports industry, or will it be caught out? Only time will tell.",

    "body": "At a redesigned former minor league baseball stadium in Dallas on Thursday night, another entrant into the crowded T20 cricket market will hope to finally break into America.\n\nIt took a decade before owners of Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises started to become profitable. Given that four of the six team backers in Major League Cricket (MLC) — the first-ever professional T20 league in the US — also own IPL sides, the nascent competition has already been given rich grounding.\n\n“Like any start-up you stay patient and keep plugging away,” Venky Harinarayan, co-owner of San Francisco Unicorns, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead More: T20 franchise contracts set to change cricket's global outlook\n\nA reported $120m (£92m) has initially been pumped in to launch MLC, which has landed some heavy hitters to fund the project, not only from the IPL franchise coffers but also from technology and media sectors. Notably Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (MSFT), who is part of the Seattle Orcas ownership group, and Adobe Inc (ADBE) CEO Shantanu Narayen.\n\nThe four IPL owners are from Delhi Capitals (Seattle Orcas), Kolkata Knight Riders (Los Angeles), Chennai Super Kings (Texas) and Mumbai Indians (New York). The other MLC teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom, both with Indian links.\n\nTalks began around five years ago when the International Cricket Council (ICC) rebooted USA Cricket and cleared up the operating body after years of governance issues. American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) were also taken on as investors, with the four founders granted a license to run a T20 league.\n\nWatch: Major League Cricket coming to Grand Prairie\n\nHarinarayan, a partner at San Francisco Bay-based Rocketship, the early-stage venture capital fund, said: “There was interest from ICC for a T20 league to promote the sport. That factor felt like it fit really well. Ashes notwithstanding, it’s the format that’s starting to take over.\n\n“It was clear pretty early on that it wouldn't be a case of writing a cheque and magic would happen. There was a fair amount of work at ground level to take it off the ground over the last three years.\n\n“It’s a labour of love to some degree. I don’t think any of the owners are doing it purely from a financial outcome. All of us being business folks, the long term viability of cricket in the US and the financial outcomes are positive. In the near term it’s about being in investment mode and trying to grow the seeds.”\n\nFor now, the San Francisco Unicorns won’t be playing in California. The inaugural MLC season will be played in Dallas — starting on 13 July with a sell-out between Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders — with the six teams playing across 18 days at the 7,000-seater Grand Prairie Stadium and at a venue in North Carolina.\n\n“There is a lot going for cricket in the US,” added Harinarayan, a Chennai native. “There is a big expat population with South Asian and Indian Americans. There is incredible passion from the expats and the other piece which is interesting is the pretty high per capita income as well.\n\n“That in my mind is the business case and being able to expand to a broader market. Like every start-up you look for a beachhead. You don’t try to own everything from day one.”\n\nThe US market presents both challenges and opportunities for the team owners — and whether MLC can redirect the cricket passion to the current cities where the expats live.\n\nRead More: IPL: Gujarat Titans, 'the Manchester City of T20 cricket'\n\n“We know they are super passionate,” added Harinarayan. “We know they support cricket teams. Let’s say you are a Pakistani living in San Francisco and you support the Pakistan team. The question is whether you can support your local team.\n\n“In an ideal world we would love to play in every city and build fan engagement. The goal is to play where the franchises are represented. There is the opportunity in the medium term and the T20 format is really well suited to an American audience.\n\nThe four IPL franchises aiming for more global riches have given the MLC a “huge shot of credibility” in its first season. However Hemant Dua, Delhi Daredevils’ former CEO, believes that the competition still has challenges in both broadcasting and infrastructure.\n\nHe said: “From a broadcast point of view, it’s not great timing for India if the games are going to happen in the evening [US time]. If you have the games in the morning, it would be beaming to India in the evening.\n\n“They still don't have the infrastructure and it will take time to build stadiums. Once all that is done, things will probably change. So this is going to be more testing than anything else.”\n\nThe hope is that MLC will be boosted when the US host matches in next year’s T20 World Cup alongside the West Indies, while the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles may include cricket on the Games’ programme.\n\nThe MLC is also not short of world-class players: Faf du Plessis, Kieron Pollard, Wayne Parnell and Anrich Nortje are just some of the stars who will be on show this month.\n\nRead More: How the IPL has impacted 'dying' Test cricket\n\nHarinarayan said: “We have been energised by the interest of the top players who want to play in the US. Every one of our teams would start up pretty well against any team in any T20 league.\n\nFormer Australia captain Aaron Finch will lead the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural edition, alongside the likes of Aaron Finch, Liam Pllunkett and Corey Anderson. The Unicorns have also partnered with Australian body Cricket Victoria, who will provide a general manager, coach and cricket operations.\n\n“It’s rare you get the chance to create a start-up in the world of cricket and that’s exciting,” added Harinarayan.\n\nWatch: How cricket is gaining traction in the US",
    "summary": "* The MLC tournament is launching in the US, with its inaugural season starting on July 13 in Dallas, featuring six teams playing across 18 days.\n* The teams are owned by a mix of Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise owners and technology and media executives, with a reported $120m invested in the league.\n* The owners are patient and committed to growing the league, with a focus on promoting the sport in the US and tapping into the expat population with South Asian and Indian American roots.\n* The league will be played in Dallas and North Carolina this season, with plans to expand to more cities in the future.\n* The MLC has attracted top-class players, including Faf du Plessis, Kieron Pollard, and Wayne Parnell, with each team expected to be competitive in the tournament.\n* The league faces challenges, including broadcast timing and infrastructure, but has the potential to grow with the support of IPL franchise owners and the inclusion of cricket in the 2028 Olympics.",

    "body": "2.4 to MD Patel , length delivery that follows the batter outside leg. Patel has a swish at it anyway and misses. de Kock collects and whips off the bails in a flash. He appeals for the stumping, and the third umpire has been called into action again. Patel did drag his back foot out of his crease but did he get back in time? It seems very, very close. Most of his back foot is on the line but there could be a smidgen just behind, at least from one angle. The other square angle, though, hints there is nothing behind the line and Patel might be in trouble here. Indeed. Touch-and-go, and this time, it is Patel who has to walk back!. 15 / 1\n\n12.5 to N Pooran , edged and taken! Imad has broken through! Slowed up beautifully on a length outside off. This one seems to grip in the surface and spins back sharply. Pooran, surprised by the turn, can only waft at it and the ball kisses the top edge before nestling into de Kock's gloves. Excellent take by the Orcas keeper, considering that took a considerable deflection!. 132 / 4\n\n13.1 to KA Pollard , and he accounts for Pollard first ball, would you believe it?! A long-hop on off stump that Pollard should have hit into the trees. Instead, he is just a little hurried on the stroke and cannot get the elevation or the power he desires. Arrows it straight to deep mid wicket, where Gannon does the rest. The umpires want to check Harmeet's front foot but he has gotten just enough behind the line to make this a legal delivery!. 132 / 5\n\n17.1 to TH David , yes, it does! David bites the dust! Full delivery just outside off stump. David tries to tonk it into tomorrow but this is just full enough to not allow him to get under it. The ball takes the inside edge, cannons off the pads and into the stumps. Harmeet gives himself a bit of a send-off to boot, and this is a massive wicket at this stage!. 165 / 6\n\n12.5 to SS Ranjane , has Ranjane been strangled down the leg side?! Back of a length delivery that seems to slide down the leg side. Ranjane has a swing at it and according to the umpire, he misses. Pooran, though, is convinced that Ranjane has gotten a tickle to this and with Pooran now being skipper, he has no qualms in going upstairs. The ball is pretty close to the glove and Snicko returns with a gigantic spike when the ball is next to the glove. Pooran has gotten it right, and the Orcas are now four down!. 123 / 4\n\n17.1 to D Pretorius , and he nicks off Pretorius! Innocuous back of a length delivery outside off and all Pretorius had to do was pat it for a single and turn the strike over to Klaasen. Instead, he tries to smash the cover off the ball and ends up feathering it through to Pooran. The Orcas lose another, and this will put further pressure on Klaasen!. 175 / 6\n\n17.2 to Imad Wasim , gone first ball, oh my! Slower yorker on off stump that dips devilishly and very late. Imad has no clue about this and is way too early into the stroke. The ball squirms past the bat and smashes him on the back pad, right in front of middle stump. The umpire raises his finger and Imad does not even bother with the review. Boult is now on a hat-trick!. 175 / 7\n\n17.4 to Harmeet Singh , cleans him up with an absolute corker! Another beautifully disguised and executed knuckle-ball. It pitches on a length just outside of and seems to nip bac in. Harmeet, like Imad, is all at sea and sees the ball breeze past the bat before flattening off stump!. 176 / 8",

    "title": "Major League Cricket's conundrum: who exactly is an American player?",
    "date": "Sun Jul 30 18:20:00 2023",
    "body": "MI New York showed it's possible to be successful while using USA players, but will MLC mandate their inclusion in future?\n\nAs the first year of Major League Cricket builds to a crescendo on Sunday night in Grand Prairie, Texas, the tournament final will feature an MI New York side whose stars have dominated the stats columns in the event.\n\nNicholas Pooran enters as the leading scorer with 251 runs as well as the most sixes in the tournament with 21, while Tim David is also in the top five in runs scored with 199 at an average of 49.75 and a strike rate of 171.55 and the second most sixes in the tournament with 16. Trent Boult is the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 19, eight more than the nearest bowler. There's also a spinner in the MI New York squad who is very impressively leading an important category in T20 cricket. But it isn't Rashid Khan.\n\nThis name might not have been on the tip of the tongue of any casual fan at the start of the tournament when asked to name one of the event's best bowlers. But left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige's league-leading 5.58 economy rate stands out for another very important reason in this fledgling American T20 franchise league.\n\nRelated\n\nMLC final week: Nicholas Pooran, and a bit of this and that\n\nKenjige: 'We have a responsibility to do the right things all the time'\n\nWho qualifies as a local cricketer in MLC?\n\nDallas metroplex resident Kenjige, 32, is one of just nine US-born players on MLC rosters, and one of only two to actually make anyone's starting XI along with MI New York team-mate Steven Taylor. He has been a USA national team player since 2017, much-loved and respected within the US community for his unrivalled work ethic, yet one who was very much unheralded on the global stage before this tournament began. But the support that he and other USA players have received from MI New York management is a blueprint for promoting local players in MLC going forward.\n\n\"I think you have to win and develop at the same time,\" MI New York head coach Robin Peterson said during a post-match press conference at the halfway stage of the tournament when discussing his team's selection policy regarding the visibility of USA players in their squad. \"It's not either or. That's the job we're here to do. Players from the Associate nations and the USA national team, they need to become used to and ingrained in the pressure of having to perform. That's part of their development in this league. Yes, we do have a keen development angle, but at the top of our mind is always trying to win and you can learn a lot from winning.\"\n\nWhen other franchise leaders were asked the same question during the tournament, the answer was generally that winning comes first. But MI New York has shown that it is possible to walk and chew at the same time.\n\nHeading into the tournament final, a total of ten players with USA caps have made 56 appearances in the starting XI in 18 matches. But MI New York have led the way with 21 of those selections spread across four players. Aside from Kenjige, opener Shayan Jahangir is third on the team's runs chart behind Pooran and David with 154 at an average of 25.66. MI New York has also picked Taylor and USA captain Monank Patel for more than half the matches played. They also took three other USA players in the draft - Kyle Phillip, Jessy Singh and Saideep Ganesh - and when Phillip was ruled out of the tournament after his bowling action was reported at the World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe, his place was taken by another US-eligible player in Slade van Staden.\n\nBut most of the other franchises have fallen short when it comes to giving USA players a platform to shine. San Francisco Unicorns, who failed to make the playoffs, did not start a single capped USA player. Yet it is not just the what but the how this has come about that is of particular note.\n\nOn one hand, players like Saurabh Netravalkar for Washington Freedom and Cameron Gannon for Seattle Orcas have shown that, given a chance, USA players are more than capable of holding their own. Former USA captain Netravalkar registered the tournament's best bowling figures of 6 for 9 against Unicorns and ended with a team-best ten wickets. Dual national Gannon, who last represented USA in 2019 but on either side of that appearance has committed his time to Sheffield Shield cricket in Australia, is the joint-leading wicket-taker for the other tournament finalist Orcas with 11 wickets at an average of 14.09.\n\nOn the flip side, most franchises have exploited MLC's nebulous definition of \"domestic player\" to mainly pick non-USA eligible players - many of whom had a negligible impact - to fill their domestic quota. Contrary to the Global T20 Canada and the UAE's ILT20, a pair of leagues who mandate a minimum number of three and two domestic players respectively in each starting XI - and clearly define them as someone who is eligible for or has been capped for Canada or the UAE - MLC officials determined that a player could meet that standard simply by merely pledging to \"hold a 'qualified visa', have established their 'primary and permanent residence' in the US, and will continue to satisfy the ICC's guideline regarding ten out of 12 months for three consecutive years\".\n\nIt opened the door for the farcical situation of Chaitanya Bishnoi, who landed in the USA merely days before the MLC draft for domestic players in March but was taken in the fourth round for $40,000. Though not as egregious an example, former Pakistan international Mukhtar Ahmed was playing domestic cricket in Faisalabad as recently as September 2022 before being taken as a domestic player in March's MLC draft for the second round price tag of $65,000.\n\nBishnoi went on to make 52 runs in four innings (entering at No. 8 in three of his four innings) and bowled three overs for Unicorns. Mukhtar's returns were perhaps even more negligible: occupying prime real estate at No. 3 in the batting order every match for Freedom, he scored 78 runs at an average of 13.00 and a strike rate of 105.40 with a best of 20.\n\nThis raises pertinent questions. A: Why are players who have played internationals for other countries being regarded as locals if they have not qualified yet by ICC rules to play for USA? B: Shouldn't a player like Mukhtar, who is currently ineligible to play for USA and has played for Pakistan previously, be regarded as overseas and have to compete for overseas slots with the likes of Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf? C: Did any such player genuinely raise the standard of the league, thereby perhaps justifying the leniency in the rules that allows such picks in place of a US-eligible player?\n\nThere is another wrench in the equation of local players though. There are cases like England's Liam Plunkett, New Zealand's Corey Anderson and Sri Lanka's Shehan Jayasuriya - players who married American citizens and migrated to the USA for family reasons totally unrelated to MLC.\n\nPlunkett has made considerable efforts to establish links in the local Pennsylvania sports cricket community, mainly through academy coaching, and the same is true of Anderson in the Dallas area. But Plunkett is not eligible to play for USA and few, if any, promotional media segments organised in the build-up to the tournament have attempted to identify him as anything other than one of England's heroes from the 2019 World Cup final win. He was even introduced in his opening spell of the tournament to TV audiences around the world by MLC broadcast commentator Pommie Mbangwa as the \"50-over World Cup winner from England\".\n\nIt would not seem unreasonable to establish a middle-ground category for players like Plunkett who are in a type of limbo: England international career done, but now firmly entrenched in the US cricket community despite not being eligible to play for USA. Why not ensure a minimum number of US-eligible players in the XI while also making room for a few \"wildcard domestic\" players? At least it would go some way towards ending the charade of pretending to portray Plunkett as something he is not, nor has Plunkett ever tried to be, while also curbing the practice of declaring players \"domestic\" at the 11th hour.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Global T20 Canada's policy of three Canadian players in the starting XI was not always so. In year one, the GT20's original rules stated that four Canada players needed to be drafted into each squad, but there was no mandate to play any of them in the starting XI, and many teams chose not to. It was only Saad bin Zafar's magical Player-of-the-Match performance in the tournament-final win by Vancouver Knights that seemingly opened eyes to the fact that Canada players could and would shine, if only given a chance.\n\nTime will tell if MLC adjusts their roster policy for the second year of the league to mandate a minimum number of US-eligible players in the starting XI in the same way that GT20 and ILT20 do. Until that time comes, MI New York have led the way in showing that whether by force or by choice, USA players are capable of holding their own both against and alongside some of the biggest names on the global T20 franchise circuit.\n\nPeter Della Penna is ESPNcricinfo's USA correspondent @PeterDellaPenna",
    "summary": "**Tournament Update**: The MLC tournament is reaching its final stage, with MI New York dominating the stats columns, led by Nicholas Pooran, Tim David, and Trent Boult.\n\n**Local Player Inclusion**: MI New York has successfully integrated USA players into their squad, with four players making 21 appearances in the starting XI. Other franchises have been less successful in promoting local talent, with some exploiting the definition of \"domestic player\" to pick non-USA eligible players.\n\n**Policy Questions**: The article raises questions about the MLC's policy on domestic players, suggesting that players who have played internationals for other countries should not be considered locals if they haven't qualified to play for the USA. It also highlights cases of players who have migrated to the USA for family reasons, but are not eligible to play for the USA.\n\n**Future of Local Player Inclusion**: The article concludes that the MLC may need to adjust its roster policy to mandate a minimum number of US-eligible players in the starting XI, as seen in other leagues like the Global T20 Canada and the UAE's ILT20.",

As first revealed by Mail Sport, England batsman Roy terminated his £60,000-a-year ECB incremental contract to take up a £300,000, two-year deal with the LA team.\n\nRoy and fellow 2019 World Cup winner Liam Plunkett, who now lives in the States with his American wife Emeleah, are the only two English players involved in the first season of the franchise competition.\n\nFollow Mail Sport on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@mailsport\n\nHowever, MLC have their sights set on signing the country's best players for future editions, which could cause more problems for the England team, as well as the Hundred, which is held in August.\n\n'American sports fans want to see the best in the world,' said MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan. 'They don't want second-tier talent. They insist on the best. England is fortunate to have some of those with the likes of Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow and Harry Brook.'\n\nSome of the high-profile overseas players in action in the States include Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Anrich Nortje, Quinton de Kock, Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson, Shadab Khan and Rashid Khan.\n\nAustralia's Headingley centurion Mitchell Marsh had been due to play for Seattle Orcas but pulled out because of his involvement in the Ashes.",

    "body": "The world cricket's ecosystem is slowly seeing a paradigm shift towards franchise cricket and the entry of Indian Premier League franchises in the United States through the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket (MLC) could be a significant step in that direction. (More Cricket News)\n\nWith Kolkata Knight Riders (Los Angeles), Chennai Super Kings (Texas), Mumbai Indians (New York) and Delhi Capitals (Seattle Orcas) taking ownership or making significant investments in four of the six franchises (the other two being Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns), the cricketing landscape is going to change forever.\n\nEven the two franchises which don't have IPL investments are also owned by persons of Indian origin. San Francisco Unicorns' top investors are Venture Capitalists Venky Hariharan and Anand Rajaraman, who have got Australian state side Victoria on board.\n\nWashington Freedom is owned by Indian American Sanjay Govil along with New South Wales state cricket body from Australia. Not to forget Seattle has Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella as one of the investors.\n\nBut the IPL franchises are now expanding their bouquet of teams across leagues in the West Indies, UAE, South Africa and now US is another untapped market that wasn't being explored for a long time despite the Asian diaspora craving for some regular cricket show at least once a year.\n\nOn Monday, early morning India time (Sunday night in Houston), the likes of former Australia captain Aaron Finch (San Francisco), Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas), a former South African skipper and even now a batting mainstay, premier pacer Anrich Nortje (Washington), Sri Lanka's top T20 freelancer Wanindu Hasaranga (Washington), dashing all-rounders Mitchell Marsh (Seattle) and Marcus Stoinis (SF Unicorns) are the first lot of quality internationals picked up by 'Draft System', which is a Major League thing.\n\nIn major US sports like basketball and baseball, there are no auctions held and only the draft picks, and hence that has been followed by the Major League Cricket as well.\n\n\"A private cricket league in the US is very different from private leagues in, say the UAE or South Africa. But in terms of revenue model, I expect the MLC to be much more successful in coming years,\" said Hemant Dua, former CEO of erstwhile Delhi Daredevils, who has worked in franchise business model of sport for years.\n\nDua, then explained why USA has potential to be successful.\n\n\"Building infrastructure is the least of the problems in the US. Also, the Asian diaspora that (Indians, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans) comprises of people with more white-collared jobs and more disposable income than majority of the Asian diaspora in the UAE.\n\n\"Plus the UAE league is more dependant on international players, but Indians in US will support their locals too. You need to factor in all these issues. One thing what MLC organisers need to look at is Indian audience timings to garner greater broadcast revenue.\"\n\nWE MIGHT SEE MORE RETIREMENTS IN FUTURE IN INDIA\n\nThe club versus country debate has been raging for some time. The BCCI doesn't allow its active cricketers to play any other leagues apart from IPL but the start of Major League Cricket in US could see a lot of domestic retirements in India because of the propensity to migrate to the US.\n\nTake the case of Unmukt Chand and Milind Kumar, who have found takers in the inaugural season after chucking their domestic cricket careers in India, which wasn't going anywhere.\n\n\"If you are not ensured earning of at least 15 crore from IPL in five years, or you aren't a top-line India international with endorsements and Rs 50-crore plus earnings, why would you stay back?\" an IPL franchise source told PTI while discussing the possibilities.\n\n\"A retirement from all forms of cricket in India opens avenues to play multiple T20 leagues, earn at least 6-8 crore per year for 4-6 months of work and also maintain a fine work-life balance. But, yes, this holds true for only skilled T20 players with no ambitions of playing red-ball cricket and I can vouch, there are many,\" he added.\n\nWhile the ICC has already set the next five years' FTP in place after consultation with the various major international cricket boards, the lure of six months of work and six months' leave and plying trade in only private leagues, is a reality that is knocking hard on the establishment's door.\n\nRecently, the custodians of the game, MCC, after its annual meeting stated: \"The men's cricket schedule in 2023 is saturated with franchise competitions, which overlay and compete with the ICC Future Tours Programme (FTP) of bilateral international cricket, recently released until 2027. The only gap in the combined schedules this year is in October and November when the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup takes place in India.\"\n\nThe Federation of International Cricketers Association (FICA) had released its annual report a few months back, which had stated that around 40 per cent of the current cricketers in the market are freelancers and there are 49 per cent, are ready to reject central contracts for plying trade in private leagues.\n\nSome interesting days lie ahead for all the stakeholders in world cricket.",

    "date": "Thu Jul 13 08:00:09 2023",
    "body": "After many false dawns, professional cricket is finally poised to cross the much-coveted frontier into the United States.\n\nTo an ever-expanding list of global T20 franchise leagues comes the addition of America's Major League Cricket (MLC), which some believe could be the biggest disruptor the sport has seen for some time.\n\nWith the inaugural tournament's first game taking place on Thursday, 13 July, BBC Sport lifts the lid on a competition with weighty aspirations.\n\nThe recent history of cricket in the United States has been riddled with broken promises and failed enterprises that have sunk almost without trace.\n\nChoosing Nasa's iconic Houston space centre for its glitzy inaugural player draft held earlier this year, MLC will hope it does not suffer similar problems.\n\nThe initial 19-game season will feature six teams - MI New York, Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, Seattle Orcas, San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom - competing in regulation T20 format matches over a 2.5-week period.\n\nAlthough because the US is an associate member of the ICC, the matches themselves, like the International League T20 held in United Arab Emirates earlier this year, will not count towards a player's official T20 domestic career statistics.\n\nConfusingly, the locations in each team name bear little relation to where matches will be played, with a dearth of suitable venues meaning the entire tournament will take place either at a converted former baseball stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas, or a smaller cricket facility in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nIt is something Justin Geale, MLC tournament director, is keen to address: \"To grow local fans we need to play in local areas. Playing at two venues is not ideal.\n\n\"The model needs to get to home and away fixtures pretty soon, so we plan to increase to around a 30-game season next year. We've already got plans next year to pop up in San Francisco.\n\n\"I would hope within three to five years we can have good-sized stadiums of 10 to 20,000 seats in our key markets. That's our aim.\"\n\nThe initial infrastructure issues have had little impact on the quality of players attracted to the league, with a host of marquee names on board.\n\nEngland's sole representatives are World Cup winners Jason Roy, who gave up his England white-ball contract to play, and Liam Plunkett. It is understood MLC also sounded out Moeen Ali before his decision to come out of retirement for the Ashes.\n\nOther seasoned internationals include Afghanistan's Rashid Khan, South Africa's Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada, West Indians Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell, and Australian pair Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch.\n\nNo surprises here: money talks. The tournament has been co-founded by The Times of India Group, India's largest media conglomerate, and secured a hefty $120 million (£94m) in initial funding through some influential backers, including the likes of Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella.\n\nOwners of Indian Premier League (IPL) clubs - Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals - have stakes in four of the six MLC teams, with the other two supported by Australian state organisations Cricket New South Wales and Cricket Victoria.\n\n\"The beauty of having the IPL teams on board gives us credibility and access to players, coaching staff and great opportunities for the domestic players here,\" said Geale.\n\n\"Our first fundraising round brought in a lot of high-net-worth individuals, including some very successful Silicon Valley people, who were very good at running businesses. Our model, though, is that the cricket has to be very good.\"\n\nEach of the six teams had a purse of $1.15m (£900,000) to spend on a squad of between 15 and 18 players, putting the finances on par with the likes of The Hundred, despite having only one-third as many matches.\n\nRoy is likely to earn in the region of £150,000 for his stint in the MLC, dwarfing the £60,000-£70,000 he earned annually from his incremental England contract.\n\nWith Indian owners, Indian co-founders and a whole host of backroom staff employed by IPL franchises, it is easy to assume the MLC might aim to be a smaller copycat version of the world's most lucrative cricket league.\n\n\"There's no shying away from the fact that, commercially, India is the centre of the cricket world,\" said Geale.\n\n\"But we're absolutely trying to create our own brand. It's definitely not the mini IPL. Our aim is to carve out our own identity. MLC needs to be an American product as much as we can make it.\"\n\nMLC will tap into traditional US sporting rituals by playing the national anthem before games, adopting cricket's equivalent of baseball's ceremonial first pitch and providing glitzy entertainment during the innings break.\n\nGeale continued: \"If you go to Minor League Baseball, they hustle so much to get people in. In Dallas, where we are looking to engage the local community, we'll have to do a lot more of that.\n\n\"It could be a 'cricket meets baseball night', a 'Bollywood night' or an 'Australian night'. Ultimately, the goal would be to take some of the best of America and the best of cricket, and put them together.\"\n\nThe evening scheduling of matches is a conscious decision to target a local market rather than prioritise television viewers overseas. Nonetheless, matches will be shown in the UK on satellite channels.\n\nThe opening match - between Texas Super Kings and LA Knight Riders - is sold out. Locally, Geale admits they will have to aim for the \"low-hanging fruit\" of people who already know the sport before they can attract newcomers.\n\n\"While we don't just want an Indian demographic, that's commercially where we're going to have to start,\" he said. \"But we are also tapping into local schools and clubs to get new people because that's where the upside is.\n\n\"We're realistic. It's not going to be full every night. Our stadium holds 7,000 and we're working really hard to get the local support.\"\n\nIt has strong financial backing, an impressive roster and has been three years in the making, but in an oversaturated franchise league market there are few guarantees the MLC will thrive. The long-term hope is that the US could be the sport's untapped superpower.\n\n\"I hate the word 'potential' because it's been used too much in the US, but there is a huge market,\" said Geale. \"Where else do we go if we want to grow the game? If it's not China or Russia, it's got to be the US.\"\n\nAmerica's star pace bowler Ali Khan is confident, saying: \"I think it's going to be huge. I think after the IPL this is going to be the second biggest league.\n\n\"Why? Because the market is here, the sponsors are here, the money is here. It's a big country. There is so much opportunity. It's life-changing for us.\"\n\nFor an American team that recently made the Cricket World Cup Qualifier for the first time in almost two decades, there is hope the tournament helps grow a fledgling domestic scene and improving national side.\n\nHowever, excitement is not universal, with concerns on this side of the Atlantic over a tournament that takes place during the English summer.\n\nGiles White, Hampshire director of cricket, said: \"Assuming it's a success, that day is coming where they will want to attract the best players. If those players come from this country then it could detract from the competitions played over here.\"\n\nBut success is an assumption not even Geale is willing to make: \"It's something that keeps me up at night. We have given ourselves the best chance to succeed. Whether it does or not, I can't control that. On paper it sounds great, but let's see. What an adventure though, eh?\"",

The Indians organisation already owns a team in South Africa’s SA20 competition and another outfit in the UAE-based International League T20 (ILT20). As well as investing overseas, Reliance also recently bought a Women’s Premier League (WPL) franchise under the Mumbai Indians banner.\n\n“With our entry into the first T20 franchise cricket league in the US, I hope we are able to establish Mumbai Indians as a global brand of fearless and entertaining cricket,” said Indians owner Nita Ambani.\n\nThe Indians’ acquisition comes after the Capitals were confirmed to be partnering with the Seattle Orcas franchise. The IPL team’s co-owner GMR Group has bought a stake in the Orcas as part of the deal, joining an investor group that includes Satya Nadella, the chairman and chief executive of Microsoft and Soma Somasegar, the managing director of Madrona Ventures. Similarly to the Indians, the Capitals have also previously bought teams in SA20, ILT20 and in the WPL.\n\n“We see America as the new frontier for cricket’s growth globally, and the Pacific Northwest provides an incredible opportunity for us to bring the resources of GMR Sports to the region and help the Seattle Orcas build a team competing for championships,” said Kiran Kumar Grandhi, managing director and chief executive of GMR Group.\n\nMeanwhile the Super Kings are investing in the Texas-based MLC franchise. According to ESPNcricinfo, the IPL outfit have partnered with a local investor to buy the team. It is the second overseas purchase for the Super Kings, who also own a SA20 team.\n\nThe trio join fellow IPL franchise the Kolkata Knight Riders as investors in MLC. The Knight Riders have been long-time backers of the competition, with its owners the Knight Riders Group contributing part of the US$30 million investment to build a 10,000-seater cricket stadium near Los Angeles, a venue which will be the setting for the IPL franchise’s partner MLC team.\n\nA pair of Australian state cricket associations have also formed partnerships with the remaining franchises. The Washington DC-based Freedom team has aligned with New South Wales Cricket in a partnership to boost the US team’s infrastructure, with a similar deal in place between the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket Victoria.\n\nThe MLC recently held its player draft this month, with the season to begin in July.\n\nSportsPro says…\n\nThe possibility of investing into MLC seems too good an opportunity to pass up for the owners of the Indians, Capitals and Super Kings, given the chance to market their brands into a huge untapped market for cricket in the US.\n\nWhile already invested in teams based in South Africa and the UAE, the prospect of gaining American fans through their involvement in the new competition could prove to be hugely beneficial. For the MLC, the involvement of IPL teams adds credibility and expertise as it looks to establish cricket in a country that hasn’t yet embraced the sport.\n\nThe overseas investments also give the IPL a significant say in how the global T20 ecosystem is run. With investments across a number of competitions, the Indians, for example, can control where their players deploy their talents, the makeup of the calendar and the use of central resources. As the reach of the IPL continues to grow, this ability to control external competitions will undoubtedly shape the sport’s future.",

    "title": "The T20 World Cup In 2024 Will Give A Huge Fillip To Cricket In The US: MLC's Tom Dunmore",
    "date": "",
    "body": "The first edition of Major League Cricket (MLC), a six-franchise T20 tournament in the US, is into its last mile, and there have been a few sell-outs already, says Tom Dunmore, the vice president of marketing, MLC. America might be a baseball country, he says, but there’s no reason why cricket can’t be slowly injected into its landscape, especially because newer audiences are willing to look beyond the traditional favourites. The country also has a history with the game—the first ever international cricket match was played between the US and Canada, in 1844, a good 33 years before the first Test match was played between England and Australia. MLC has made a good start, but the focus in the next few years will be on finetuning the platform and building a new audience, Dunmore tells Forbes India in an interview. Edited excerpts:\n\nQ. The group stage of Major League Cricket (MLC) is over. Your first thoughts on T20 cricket in America?\n\nWe’ve sold out all the seven games in North Carolina and the first few games in Dallas, although these are relatively small venues. The stadium in Dallas is 6,000-7,000 capacity, while the former is about 3,500. But I’m sure we could have sold many more tickets even if we had larger venues.\n\nBut it’s not just the numbers. The energy and the passion in the stadium, and the excitement of seeing international players in flesh, have been incredible. We’ve already got a great support base from cricket fans who’ve grown up in a cricket-loving country but now live here—that gives us a strong platform to build from. They’ve never had a domestic league to watch and follow nor prime time cricket to watch; they’ve had to watch it in the middle of the night, in keeping with the time zones of the rest of the world where cricket matches are typically played. T20 gives you the chance to take a great product to them, where you can bring superstar players from other countries along with quality domestic players. When you combine that, you’ve got something that really works.\n\nWe didn’t know for certain how this would be received, but early indications are definitely strong. We’ve had proof of concept that the existing fanbase loves it, from here it’s a question of how we build new fanbases. It’ll take time, but the US is such a big country and such a sport-mad country that even if we get a sliver of the larger population that doesn’t know cricket, it will add to what’s already the fourth or fifth-biggest cricket media market in the world anyway.\n\nQ. How has cricket grown in the US, especially at the grassroots level?\n\nIt’s grown a lot from a fairly low base over the past few years. A lot of new academies have sprung up, there are about 20 affiliated major league cricket academies around the country now. We have our minor league system, which is a development or pathway league of sorts; it has 26 teams in it from 20 cities around the country, playing around 100-150 matches round the year. The minor league’s great for the future of the sport. The major league, as great as it is, is a short tournament; we need high quality cricket through the year to give development opportunities to players and enable communities to watch the sport. And that’s what the minor league does.\n\nAlso read: A T20 cricket league has taken off in the US. Wait, what?\n\nQ. America itself has a lot of popular sports. There’s Major League Baseball, NBA, NFL. Soccer superstar Lionel Messi has recently joined MLS, so that will have a lot of eyeballs. How can you get Americans to watch cricket?\n\nIt’s all about introducing it and finding the right audiences that are primed to be interested in it. I think the younger baseball fans are a great audience for cricket; they already like a bat and ball sport, albeit cricket’s a little different. You see US sports fans embracing newer sports than ever before, be it F1 or soccer. It’s not like the old days where they were just fans of the big four sports.\n\nIt’s about explaining the sport as well and we have to do some fundamental work there. That’s a great project for us for years 2,3 and 4. This year, it’s about getting the platform right and reaching out to the core audience; then we can really look to expand to other audiences in future.\n\nI think if we get people out to watch a cricket match, they’re going to love it. We all know how exciting a T20 match can be, and now we’re building stadiums and producing it well so you see it in the right way. It’s all a matter of giving people a taste and then build it on from there.\n\nQ. A lot of spectators of cricket in the US are expats from the subcontinent and the Caribbean islands. How can cricket be taken beyond these two constituencies?\n\nBy testing different audiences. We do some work with influencers, like Jomboy, who’s a baseball influencer, based out of New York. We’ve done cricket-baseball crossover content with him. Plus, it’s about creating good experiences in the stadium, and making it attractive for people to go and see the matches. There’s a high bar for sports in the US, and the fact that we are able to bring the best players really helps. We’re also doing marketing activations with local sports teams like NFL’s Dallas Cowboys and baseball team Texas Rangers. The media outreach is important too, to get on the news and sports coverage. But it'll take time, we want to build audiences brick by brick. The T20 World Cup is coming to the US [co-hosted by the West Indies] next year. It’s going to be massive, because Americans know how important a World Cup is. That, I feel, will break through to a mainstream audience.\n\nQ. Multiple T20 leagues have mushroomed across the world. How does MLC stand out from being just another T20 league?\n\nWe’re different in a lot of ways, first being we are building cricket in a non-traditional market. Unlike the newly launched SA20, the domestic T20 league in South Africa, we are a new market. We’re also building infrastructure for the sport in the US. Most other T20 leagues operate with existing infrastructure—The Hundred is playing in all the big Test match grounds in England, same in South Africa. In our case, we are building stadiums, academies, coaches, domestic players. We’re investing millions of dollars into creating what you need to have a T20 league at all. We are really going bottom-up instead of top-down.\n\nAlso read: From handball to panja, why sports leagues are taking off in India\n\nQ. What are some of the lessons to learn from the IPL, when it comes to scaling the game?\n\nThe IPL is on another planet compared to everyone else in cricket. But, it’s ironic really, how they’ve Americanised cricket—the music on the ground, the experience, we didn’t have all that in cricket before the IPL. And we are bringing it back to America. The way the teams are such strong brands, how the players have transformed into stars, we want to see that in the US. We do have some of the same players, and some of the IPL brands too. But we want our own teams that don’t have IPL brands to develop alongside them. So, while there is a lot to learn from the IPL, we need a slightly different approach given we have to develop the sport as well.\n\nQ. The first season is drawing to a close, with the MLC final on Sunday. What are the post-season plans?\n\nTo keep the momentum going and build on it. It can be done through social and digital content and through more activation, building connections for the minor league that will start right after. And then, we’re heading into the next year, which is huge since the US will co-host the T20 World Cup along with the second season of the MLC. That’s a lot to prepare for, and we want to work along with the ICC to help promote the sport in the US.\n\nOne of my most abiding memories of the past 10 days is the first time we saw a big six. The crowd got on their feet and cheered and waved flags, and it felt like you were watching cricket in any cricket-loving country. To have that in an American stadium is pretty cool. Every time I see that, I’m happy we’ve built this and, hopefully, we can deliver more of these moments to fans for years to come.",

The redevelopment of the venue is scheduled to take place throughout 2021 before playing host to the Texas MLC franchise that is planned to launch in 2022, as well as a base for the USA Cricket National team and a premier High Performance Center.\n\n“As the first Major League Cricket stadium in the United States, Grand Prairie represents a seminal moment for the sport in America, and we are incredibly excited to partner with the City of Grand Prairie to bring Major League Cricket to Dallas,” said Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders of ACE and MLC. “Grand Prairie’s centralized location in the U.S. and the thriving Texas cricketing community, allied with the quality of the facility, made it the perfect site for us and we are certain that this is the beginning of a fruitful long-term partnership with the City that will bring much success.”\n\nThe City of Grand Prairie is an ideal location for a premier cricket stadium in Texas, with its strong cricket fan base and demographics in surrounding areas, favorable time zone for broadcast in major international cricket markets, and Dallas-Fort Worth’s pedigree for major sports teams and stadiums. The new cricket stadium will see the existing baseball diamond converted to an international size and quality cricket field capable of hosting major international competitions, a number of training nets and batting lanes added, as well as two additional outside turf fields that will be used for training and by the affiliated MLC academies. Upon completion, it will be the most extensive fully-dedicated cricket facility in the United States.\n\nThe venue will also be a centerpiece of USA Cricket’s efforts to bring major international events to the United States, including regional International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup and T20 World Cup Qualifiers for Men and Women, Cricket World Cup League 2 series, and International Series against local rivals Canada and the West Indies, as well as other contemporary nations. The stadium will also be a featured aspect of USA Cricket’s efforts to bring the ICC T20 World Cup and other major events to the United States by 2031, in a process that is ongoing as part of a joint bid with Cricket West Indies.\n\n“We are very excited about this opportunity to bring cricket to Texas by converting our minor league baseball stadium,” said Grand Prairie Mayor Ron Jensen. “Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world behind soccer, with a large and growing audience in the states. We look forward to an exciting future with our partners.”\n\nThe redeveloped stadium is slated to be ready for cricket in Spring 2022, but will serve as a key High Performance center for the USA Cricket Men’s and Women’s National Teams and other key youth and zonal cricket squads during the interim. The Men’s National Team is currently ranked 19th in the world, having gained One Day International status for the first time in 2019. The USA Women’s National Team will be attempting to qualify for the ICC Women’s World Cup for the first time next year, having advanced to the global qualifier in 2019.\n\n“In association with our partners at ACE, we now have a world-class facility to develop our domestic talent and help us fulfill the goals we announced in our Foundational Plan,” said Paraag Marathe, USA Cricket Chairman. “The successful development of a cricket-dedicated stadium has long been a priority for us, and it is a significant stride forward for the growth of cricket in America. We also look forward to bringing international cricket events, and the crowds that go with them, to our new stadium, and to help introduce the sport to a broader audience.”\n\nUSA Cricket has recently undergone a significant transformation that includes the release of the organization’s first Foundational Plan with a vision to establish cricket as a leading sport in the USA and become a full member of the International Cricket Council by 2030. Cricket is the world’s second-most popular sport in terms of global viewership, attracting billions of viewers worldwide with a significant, growing American fanbase. USA Cricket counts more than 150,000 regular players across the country, with roughly 20 million fans and more than 4 million regular viewers of cricket.\n\nHonored by Ballpark Digest as the Best New Ballpark in 2008 following its inaugural season, AirHogs Stadium served as the home of the Texas AirHogs of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball for 12 years. The stadium, located conveniently between Arlington and Dallas, is adjacent to Lone Star Park horse racing track and The Theater at Grand Prairie, currently seats a capacity of 5,445 and features 13 luxury suites and ample space for improved amenities to enhance the experience of fans and cricketers alike. The stadium will be repurposed to be completely dedicated for cricket, with an increase in the seating capacity planned to accommodate more than 8,000 spectators with additional and upgraded hospitality features.\n\nAlong with the changing demographics of the Dallas region that have made the area a prime location for the grassroots development of cricket, the sport has seen recent progress domestically at the professional level. Following a player draft in August this year, Minor League Cricket (MiLC) successfully staged a series of exhibition matches over five weeks, the largest national cricket competition in U.S. history. The best amateur cricketers in the U.S. combined with 36 first-class and international players to play 51 competitive and entertaining T20 matches across 17 venues involving 18 of the 24 MiLC franchises with 312 drafted players competing in at least one match. ACE is preparing to launch its full inaugural MiLC T20 cricket season in May 2021, with MLC expected to start its competition in 2022.\n\nMajor League Cricket, which is exclusively sanctioned by USA Cricket, represents the most ambitious and transformational venture ever undertaken in the American cricket landscape. Focused on staging the highest quality T20 cricket for U.S. cricket fans, MLC will feature top international cricketers from around the globe, and provide a stage for domestic cricketers to showcase their talents to a global audience.\n\nAs the ICC’s member body for the United States, USA Cricket selected MLC as its exclusive partner for the development of a professional T20 cricket league. As exemplified by this establishment of AirHogs Stadium as a High Performance Training Center for USA Cricket, MLC provides support for both the USA’s Men’s and Women’s teams, with the goal of elevating them to the highest level of international competition.\n\nThe founders of MLC have been deeply involved with cricket in the U.S. for years, particularly with the establishment of the U.S. as a major broadcast market for the sport. MLC is co-founded by the founders of Willow TV, the largest cricket broadcaster in North America and the principals of The Times of India Group, India’s largest media conglomerate. MLC is also backed by a prominent and diverse group of investors from across the U.S.",

    "date": "Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Major League Cricket has arrived in Texas. The big question is whether the sport can catch on in the land of opportunity. Once upon a time in America, cricket was the national game. It was also the location of the sport’s very first international match. That may sound like a Ripley's Believe it or Not! fact, but ‘New York, New York’ is where it all started.\n\nThe USA and Canada played that historic game in front of 10,000 spectators at NYC’s Bloomingdale Park in 1844. It may be some time before cricket crowds are packed to the rafters in America again. This is not the MLB. Or Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium, a converted baseball venue, hosts the opening match of the MLC between the Texas Super Kings and the Los Angeles Knight Riders in front of a capacity 7,200 crowd on Thursday. The 19-match tournament runs to the end of July and will also use North Carolina’s Church Street Park with a capacity currently at 3,500.\n\nThe faster-paced T20 games have been turned into popular franchises in Pakistan, Australia, the Caribbean and England. The big shot of them all, the Indian Premier League, recently become the most-watched digital sports event globally. The IPL is a multi-million dollar machine, generating over $15m broadcasting fees per match, and coming second only to the NFL as the richest league in the world.\n\nThe cash cricket cow that is the IPL has seen big funding from American investors, including the likes of Silver Lake Partners, TPG Capital and KKR KKR and Co. The format of three-hour games filled with huge hits, world-class talent from all over the globe, pitchside entertainment and premium technology in impressive stadia makes this a very desirable product to replicate. Major League Cricket has the finances. It now needs the optics, facilities and audience.\n\nKolkata Knight Riders, owned by Bollywood superstar, Shah Rukh Khan, was the first IPL franchise to invest in the MLC. They have taken a stake in the LA team as well as committing to a brand-new cricket site in Southern California. The idea is for all six teams to have their own stadiums in the next three to five years. “Our investment in MLC in America is based on our belief in the exciting future of cricket in the U.S.A and is well aligned to our strategy of establishing Knight Riders as a global brand in T20 cricket,\" said Khan.\n\nThree other IPL franchises have followed suit with the Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, and Delhi Capitals anchoring the Texas, New York and Seattle teams respectively. Australia's Cricket Victoria has a high-performance partnership with the San Francisco Unicorns and Cricket New South Wales has teamed up to provide similar services to Washington Freedom. The league has also been sanctioned officially by the International Cricket Council. This is a serious moonshot.\n\nWith an estimated 30 million cricket fans in the USA, bolstered by South Asian and Caribbean immigrants, there is an existing community to capture. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft MSFT and a part-owner of the Seattle Sounders franchise in Major League Soccer, is one of the leading investors in the initial outlay of $120m into the MLC.\n\nBroadcasters include Willow TV and Viacom18 in India. “Our six teams feature T20 players who fans in India love to watch, and they (Viacom) are the right partner to showcase sports broadcasts in the world’s largest cricket market,” said Vijay Srinivasan , co-Founder of the MLC. The Indian subcontinent holds all the cards when it comes to cricket fanatics.\n\nThere is enough global quality on show too. Sri Lanka's Wanindu Hasaranga is one of the world’s best T20 all-rounders. Mitchell Marsh hit a swashbuckling century for Australia with huge sixes in the Headingley Ashes Test match. Pakistan’s Haris Rauf, West Indian Sunil Narine and England’s big-hitting Jason Roy are also among the stars aiming to drive home the entertainment ticket to the masses.\n\nRoy cancelled the incremental contract with his country for what could be a sum of between £150-200k (up to $260m) for just over two weeks’ work across the pond. If players see the dollar signs more than strict loyalty to their nation, then the MLC might be doing something right. It’s worth noting that the founders insist they are not trying to tread on anyone’s toes. The carrot is being dangled though.\n\nIn 2024, the USA are due to co-host the flagship ICC T20 World Cup tournament alongside the West Indies which opens the door to an even bigger audience. Recent reports hinted that the vital infrastructure in the country was not ready. However, the ICC confirmed that there are no plans to shift the venue to England as reported. The task now is for the United States to put together a team that is competitive in the next 12 months and keep developing the quality environment that such events demand.\n\nThe development of Minor League Cricket in 2021 has been important in encouraging homegrown stars. The next two and a half weeks will provide a perfect platform for exposure. If Chris Eubanks can come out of nowhere, then who knows which latent talent can rise to the surface.\n\nThe field of dreams has arrived but without Kevin Costner and no baseball bat. “Don’t find customers for your products, find products for your customers,” said American author Seth Godin. That model may be about to be strongly tested as cricket looks for a rebirth Stateside.",

No first-generation Indian American has ever been drafted that high in any of the four major sports in the U.S.\n\nAs for Major League Cricket, the sport’s global governing body is “desperate to lift its sport’s profile in America,” The Guardian reported, noting that the league has firm financial support from prominent Indian American tech executives like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and a solid roster of players. But at times, “it can feel difficult to imagine how this experiment might succeed,” The Guardian notes. “Talking to Americans about cricket is usually about as easy as explaining climate change to a ferret.”\n\nA past iteration of professional cricket tried to get off the ground in the U.S. years ago, but unlike this one, it didn’t have the backing of national or international governing bodies, The Times of India noted.

The Super Kings put up 181/6 in their 20 overs before bundling the Knight Riders out for 112 in just 14 overs.\n\nThe Knight Riders found it difficult to get their innings going right from the start as speedster Rusty Theron dismissed Martin Guptill and Rilee Rossouw in the very first over. Calvin Savage and Gerald Coetzee backed up Theron's effort by sending Nitish Kumar and Unmukt Chand back to the pavilion in quick succession. The Knight Riders were reeling at 20/4 in the fourth over.\n\nAndre Russell gave a sliver of hope to the Knight Riders when he smashed a six and two fours off Coetzee in the fourth over, however, he kept losing partners at the other end. Captain Sunil Narine and Russell put the Knight Riders at a decent position at 103/5 at the end of the eleventh over, however, Mohsin got the Super Kings back into the game with two wickets in the twelfth over.\n\nDwayne Bravo put the final nail in the coffin when he dismissed Russell for 55 runs off 34 balls in the thirteenth over with the Knight Riders 73 runs away from the target. Mohsin wrapped up the match in the very next over with the wickets of Adam Zampa and Lockie Ferguson.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Los Angeles Knight Riders won the toss and put Texas Super Kings into bat.

    "date": "Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "It was an obvious place to launch a sporting moonshot – a cricket league that can survive and thrive in America.\n\nLast week, Space Center Houston hosted a reveal of next-generation spacesuits for a lunar mission. A few days later its main hall was crowded with cricketers wearing gaudy baseball caps in the colours of their new teams as the latest attempt to bring professional cricket to the US held its domestic player draft.\n\nWith the first overall pick, the Seattle Orcas of Major League Cricket (MLC) selected an all-rounder: 30-year-old Harmeet Singh, captain of the minor-league Seattle Thunderbolts and a member of the India squad that won the 2012 under-19 World Cup.\n\nFour years after taking three wickets for England in their World Cup final win over New Zealand, Liam Plunkett will bowl for the San Francisco Unicorns. A domestic player because he lives in the Philadelphia area with his American wife, the 37-year-old was chosen in the second round.\n\nBeaming in a suit jacket, white trainers and an orange Unicorns cap, Plunkett posed for the cameras next to the Mission Mars exhibit, a bulbous silvery spacecraft dangling from the ceiling above his head as pop music and a variegated array of glowing lights lent the event a novel atmosphere: sports meets disco meets STEM.\n\nNot quite the Long Room at Lord’s. But the inaugural MLC season will boast international talent worthy of the sport’s most hallowed venues. Among Plunkett’s fellow Unicorns are the former New Zealand all-rounder, Corey Anderson, the former Australia limited overs captain, Aaron Finch, and his 2021 Men’s T20 World Cup-winning teammate, Marcus Stoinis.\n\nAnother Australian, the in-form Mitch Marsh, will play for Seattle, as will the 30-year-old former South Africa captain, Quinton de Kock. Wanindu Hasaranga, a 25-year-old Sri Lankan international, and the South African fast bowler, Anrich Nortje, have signed for the Washington Freedom. More well-known overseas names are set to be announced in the coming days to line up alongside the 54 US-based players drafted on Sunday.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee, a boosterish Houston congresswoman, opened the ceremony. “Are we ready for cricket?” she inquired. “Are we ready?”\n\nIt’s an open question. American cricket has long been tramelled by turbulent governance and earlier attempts at professional leagues struggled to get off the launch pad. But there are strong reasons for optimism, not least the wealth and experience of the MLC investors.\n\nAn initial $120m is funding the project, which has some influential backers from the technology and media sectors and India, including Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, who is part of the Seattle ownership group. Owners of Indian Premier League (IPL) clubs have stakes in four of the six MLC teams.\n\nThe season will take the T20 format and will be played from 13-30 July – helpful timing to attract stars during the southern hemisphere offseason, though problematic for players in England. Joining the Orcas, Freedom and Unicorns are the Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York and the Texas Super Kings. The locations are strategic: cities with large South Asian communities that offer ready-made fanbases, with organisers recognising that it will take years to attract significant numbers of spectators who have never played or watched cricket.\n\n“We’re trying to build infrastructure, a minor league, a major league, get the national team competitive all at the same time. There’s an awful lot going on and it’s going to take time, but I think our growth trajectory can be quick once … people see, hey this is a great product, this is going to work. I think we’ll then get a second influx of momentum,” said Justin Geale, the MLC tournament director.\n\nMLC has spent years building a developmental framework to nourish domestic players and improved grounds and training facilities are springing up. The pre-draft combine took place at a six-field complex near Houston that opened in 2019.\n\nPlunkett is convinced there is latent talent in the US. “I [visited] maybe 13 years ago and I always thought to myself I had one of the better arms in cricket in England, and I just went to the local park in Philadelphia with a few of my friends at college or who worked in Home Depot, and I think all four of them had a better arm than me,” he grinned.\n\nThe US will host the 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup, jointly with the West Indies, though Plunkett denied he is chasing a spot on the American roster next year. “I’m happy finishing international cricket with England at the World Cup,” he said.\n\nMLC has the financial heft to offer salaries comparable with competitions such as Australia’s Big Bash, England’s and Wales’s The Hundred and the ILT20 in the United Arab Emirates – the salary cap per team is understood to be slightly above $1.1m. “We can get the best players in the world,” said Geale, a former IPL director of operations. “We can put out a world-class product from day one.”\n\nRusty Theron, a former South Africa international who played for Sussex in 2012, moved to the US in 2015. The 37-year-old was drafted by the new Texas team after playing minor league cricket in the San Francisco Bay area. “We’ve got a pathway set up where if you’re a good player we’ve got eyeballs on you, somewhere you can actually make a living as a cricketer, and something to aspire to,” he said. “As far as professionals go there’s no shortage of people that are interested. After all, it’s the USA and that in itself is a brand, something that sells itself quite easily.”\n\nSan Francisco have joined forces with Cricket Victoria while Washington have partnered with Cricket New South Wales, tapping into the Australian association’s expertise in coaching and operations while giving it a foothold in America. “We’re moving with the cricket landscape, really,” said Michael Klinger, head of male elite cricket at Cricket NSW. “Cricket’s changing around the world, the T20 franchise leagues are popping up and this is one that could be very big in this market and we want to be part of it.”\n\nHowever, all the matches are expected to be staged in North Carolina and the Dallas area, where MLC has spent $19m refashioning the erstwhile abode of the defunct Texas AirHogs minor league baseball team into a 7,200-capacity cricket ground. That points to perhaps the league’s biggest challenge: the dearth of suitable venues.\n\n“We need to get to a home and away model, so they need somewhere to play in their home cities,” Geale said. “In two to three years we’d like to see some serious traction and have a lot of those facilities in place.” That is a tall order given the difficulties of building new stadiums in crowded and expensive cities. Intriguingly, the Freedom and George Mason University are shaping plans for a hybrid cricket/baseball field on the outskirts of Washington.",
    "summary": "**Launch and Draft**: The MLC held its domestic player draft at Space Center Houston, selecting players for its six teams: Seattle Orcas, San Francisco Unicorns, Washington Freedom, Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, and Texas Super Kings. The first overall pick was Harmeet Singh, an all-rounder, by the Seattle Orcas. International talent includes Liam Plunkett, Corey Anderson, Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Mitch Marsh, Quinton de Kock, Wanindu Hasaranga, and Anrich Nortje.\n\n**League Details**: The inaugural season will be played from July 13-30 in a T20 format. The league has received significant funding of $120m from investors, including Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. The league aims to build infrastructure, a minor league, and a national team simultaneously.\n\n**Growth and Challengs**: The league faces challenges, including the lack of suitable venues, but plans to invest in building facilities and eventually move to a home and away model. The league has partnered with Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales to tap into their expertise.\n\n**Key Figures**: Justin Geale, MLC tournament director, and Rusty Theron, a former South Africa international, expressed optimism about the league's growth and potential.",

    "date": "Tue Jul 18 15:51:32 2023",
    "body": "“Imagine,” my friend said, in an attempt to contextualize the ocean of flags, whistles, drums, and overall frenzy surrounding us last night in Grand Prairie, “that you’re way into basketball—and your country just got basketball.”\n\nOn a basic level, he was describing the biggest selling point of Major League Cricket, whose attempt to bring the world’s second-most popular sport to the United States—and North Texas, in particular—is the subject of my feature in our July issue. North Texas has one of the largest South Asian populations in the United States, and that community is cricket-rabid, with no significant outlet on this side of the Atlantic aside from the Caribbean. What happens when you provide one?\n\nThe answer, as we saw last night, is a sellout crowd of more than 7,000 people losing their minds for the better part of four hours as the Texas Super Kings (our new local team) took on Mumbai Indians New York. Our D Magazine contingent—Tim Rogers, Matt Goodman, Brian Reinhart, and yours truly—pegged the crowd to be well over 90 percent South Asian, which is in the ballpark of what every source I spoke with told me represents the national fan base. Per an MLC press release from over the weekend, six matches in the first 10 days reached capacity. A bunch of rich guys are building a cricket league with actual infrastructure, and now everyone is showing up.\n\nBut it would also be reductive, and unfair, to describe MLC’s appeal in relation to one group of people. Not everyone in the crowd was South Asian, after all. Take, for instance, the four of us. Tim, Matt, and Brian knew next to nothing about cricket going into last night. (Brian was there for the concessions, which he’ll write about soon enough.) Prior to reporting this story, I was in the same boat—and when it comes to understanding the action itself, still kinda sorta am. And we had a hell of a Monday night.\n\nSome of this is due to the sport itself, which is faster, more vibrant, and, frankly, more dangerous than most people realize. But the experience in the stands is what stood out to me. It would be naïve to characterize any pro sporting event as organic—those that are tend to do poorly in the profit margins—but it was largely a blissful escape from the prepackaging that contaminates American sports. There were no promotions or sponsorships jammed into each break in the action. The video board stuck to stats and the occasional, too-infrequent replay. The PA announcer chimed in for names, lineups, key points in the match … and that’s about it. It won’t last forever—sports are big business—but in the here and now, MLC seems to understand the allure of a great sport and a great atmosphere.\n\nThose two things transcend demographics. They’re why sports remain our most durable culturally unifying force. Yes, the South Asians who understand cricket and its rhythms set the tone of the crowd last night. But it didn’t take long for Matt to start blasting his canary-yellow Super Kings whistle. Or Tim to make excuses for his new sports hero, Texas captain Faf du Plessis, after an error at bat. Or all four of us to nod in approval at hard-earned runs and clap our hands at fours (when the ball rolls to the wall) and spring to our feet as fireworks exploded with each six (cricket’s version of a home run).\n\nThis was a blending of East and West, old fans and new. Concession stands offered samosas and burgers. The DJ blasted Hindi music and Kesha. Seasoned cricket watchers in the row ahead of us periodically turned to gently explain nuances of the game that we were too green to see.\n\nAnd so we learned. We laughed. We celebrated. We chowed down. And thanks to a new (to us) sport put on by a new (to everyone) league, we had a wonderful night.\n\nBy the way, the Super Kings won 154-137.",
    "summary": "* The MLC tournament has attracted a large crowd of over 7,000 people, mostly from the South Asian community in North Texas, which has one of the largest South Asian populations in the US.\n* The league has seen a successful start, with six matches in the first 10 days reaching capacity.\n* The tournament has appealed not only to the South Asian community but also to newcomers to the sport, who have enjoyed the fast-paced and vibrant game.\n* The atmosphere at the stadium was electric, with a sold-out crowd, flags, whistles, drums, and fireworks, creating a festive atmosphere.\n* The concession stands offered a mix of traditional South Asian snacks like samosas and American classics like burgers.\n* The event featured a blend of Eastern and Western cultures, with Hindi music and Kesha playing in the stadium.\n* The author and their friends, who were new to the sport, learned about cricket and enjoyed the game, cheering on the Texas Super Kings, who won the match 154-137 against Mumbai Indians New York.\n\nOverall, the article suggests that the MLC tournament has been successful in bringing the cricket-loving South Asian community together and attracting new fans to the sport, creating a unique and festive atmosphere.",

The star batter has joined as the third Australian in the dugout of Washington Freedom which already has some of the talented players and coaching personnel in their squad.\n\nThe southpaw will be playing alongside Steve Smith, who was signed by Washington Freedom earlier this year. Furthermore, Ricky Ponting is the head coach of the franchise, which makes it a trinity of Aussies in the same squad. In addition to it, Washington have some of the most talented players in the world in their lineup.\n\nEarlier this year, they announced two of their bowlers, Akeal Hosein and Marco Jansen, as their retained players from the 2023 season, while they recently announced the signing of New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra. As a unit, Freedom already seem to have a compact core of players.\n\nAlso read: MLC 2024: Rashid, Klaasen, Pooran, Boult among 23 overseas retentions\n\nTravis Head's busy schedule\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Test series against the West Indies, Head opted out of the T20I series against New Zealand, which provided him a much-needed break from the game. The Australian cricketer has been a part of the Australian team in the ODI World Cup 2023 and did not get enough rest after winning the major tournament.\n\nHe was also a part of the T20I series against India and the Test series against Pakistan and the West Indies. The southpaw took a bit of rest before taking part in the ongoing IPL 2024. He is currently playing for SRH in IPL 2023 and will continue to have a busy schedule. Head will be one of the key players for Australia in the T20 Wolrd Cup 2024.\n\nAfter the major tournament, Australia are scheduled to play England in September. To make use of the free time in July and August, Head has decided to take part in the MLC 2024. He is likely to be busy from September 2024 to January 2025 given the high-profile series against teams like England and India.",

The Jamaican all-rounder greeted the fan with a smile, hugging him first and then chatting with him.

    "body": "0.3 to FH Allen , Haring in and bangs it on a length, gets a little bit of seam movement and induces a false shot! He heaves it over the bowler's head but finds Faf du Plessis at long-on who hangs onto it brilliantly. A crucial scalp for TSK! Fabulous start for Super Kings. Bold of Sams to persist with full-length and he lured him into a big shot. 4 / 1\n\n19.4 to C Bishnoi , Oh that is a blinder! Rank full wide of off, swats it and Santner at deep point ran in and took a fantastic catch. Plucked his hand out, caught the ball and made sure it doesn't pop out of his hands. They are checking if it's a no ball, a few inches under waist height so that's all-right.. 165 / 8\n\n3.4 to MP Stoinis , Tantalizingly in the air, has a stab at that and is playing from his body. He cleverly takes the pace off and he absolutely flummoxed. Once again it is Faf du Plessis in action at cover; he kept his eyes on the ball and reverse cupped it expertly under the sun. That's a good breakthrough because he is a dangerous customer. 31 / 2\n\n15.2 to CJ Anderson , Gone, zingers are alight! Round the wicket. Good length and it zings back from the angle, tries a big mow and ends up chopping it back onto the stumps. The bowlers have mostly kept the batters on a leash here on this slow pitch. Credit to the bowlers for reading the pitch well and mixing it up nicely. 116 / 5\n\n18.2 to AJ Finch , Round the wicket, angling across, it's a full toss which sounds the death rattle. Leg-cutter which was dipping towards off stump, he went for the pull and got deceived the slowness of the delivery. That's a crucial scalp. He could have done significant damage in these last two overs but he is taken out of the equation. 151 / 6\n\n18.4 to Tajinder Singh , This looks a brilliant short but it is not far enough Excellent comeback from Coetzee who was struggling in his last spell. Befuddles him with a slower one on a full length, invites him to have a crack at it and he obliges. Hits him pretty well but didn't get the elevation. Once again it is Faf du Plessis who takes his third catch of the evening. 153 / 7\n\n10.2 to MS Wade , Spanked but not entirely mighty! Just couldn't get underneath it and Miller, who is as safe as a house, catches it superbly at deep midwicket, making sure he doesn't loses his balance because he was quite close to the rope. This was tossed a touch fuller and wide of off, he went for the slog sweep but couldn't get enough elevation and lost his shape. 85 / 3\n\n12.5 to Shadab Khan , Stupendous catch at long-off as another one bites the dust! Tossed up fuller outside leg as Shadab was stepping away from the leg stump and he smartly followed him up, he still commits to the shot but cannot time it well and didn't control his bat. 104 / 4\n\n0.2 to F du Plessis , A touch shorter and gets that big banna inswing pegging him back and thumping his front pad as they all appeal like excited students in a class but the umpire thinks otherwise. They have sent it for another opinion. Okay, so on the replay, it is clearly away from the bat, and it's three reds on the screen as they all celebrate and scream in joy. That's a fantastic review, got the line right and gets his man. Huge breakthrough!. 6 / 1\n\n1.2 to C Chetty , Edged and taken! Right on money, fast and furious gets a breakthrough. Bangs it on a shorter length on 143 kph, that's a lovely nagging line, with a hint of movement, draws him forward and it takes the outside edge through his dangling bat. Wade makes no mistake. TSK in a spot of bother. 11 / 2\n\n17.3 to Milind Kumar , Is there another twist in the tale? Fires in a heat-seeking yorker on off and uproots the off stump as he tries to scythe that away to point but misses. Vicious fist-pump and goes airborne but what an innings! He has turned the game on its head. 162 / 6",

    "body": "Chasing a challenging score of 178, the opening pair of Finn Allen and Matthew Wade propelled the San Francisco Unicorns to a rollicking start. The left-handed Wade started the assault by cutting loose in the second over before the Kiwi batter Allen teed off in the following over and thumped the opposition skipper Wayne Parnell for 22 runs. That over included 4 fours and 1 maximum. The right-handed Allen threw his wicket away after a blistering knock of 28(10) owing to a lethargic effort in running between the wickets.\n\nWade continued his onslaught by smashing Imad Wasim for three consecutive boundaries in the 5th over before the left-arm spinner took retribution and cleaned up the Aussie batter for 28(16). Despite losing two wickets, the early pyrotechnics by Wade and Allen helped the Unicorns orchestrate 67 runs off the powerplay. The Australian duo of Marcus Stoinis and Aaron Finch failed to capitalize on the laid foundation and slowed down the innings. Both the batters fall victim to left-arm spin and the two wickets in quick succession gathered momentum for the Orcas.\n\nThe San Francisco innings went haywire as they lost wickets in clusters in the middle overs. Shadab Khan played a valiant knock of 37(23) and tried to drag matter till the end but the Unicorns kept losing wickets at regular intervals and lower-order collapse did not help their cause. Cameron Gannon was the pick of the bowlers for the Orcas and attained exceptional figures of 4/23. Imad Wasim and Andrew Tye also extracted a couple of wickets.\n\nEarlier in the day, after winning the coin flip and elected to bat first, Seattle Orcas were off to a ruinous start as Haris Rauf extracted the massive wicket of Quinton de Kock 7(6) in the second over itself by uprooting the southpaw with a scorcher of a delivery. Both Nauman Anwar and Shehan Jayasuriya negated the new ball well following the early departure of de Kock and helped Orcas to aggregate 53 runs off the powerplay. Anwar and Jayasuriya added 44 runs for the 2nd wicket before Liam Plunkett outsmarted the former with some extra bounce.",

    "date": "Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Sam Hogben | 3:17pm BST 31 July 2023\n\nMajor League Cricket launched in the United States in 2023 in a longstanding attempt to bring the game to American audiences. Ownership groups from the Indian Premier League have brought their respective franchises to the USA, including the Super Kings, Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, and Delhi Capitals, while two of the other franchises have support from Australian states New South Wales and Cricket Victoria.\n\nAs a result, many stars of the white-ball format such as England’s World Cup winners Jason Roy and Liam Plunkett along with international stars Rashid Khan, Trent Boult, and Kagiso Rabada are plying their trade in the new league.\n\nThe immediate attraction of star power has resulted in a competitive series, and perhaps more importantly sell-out crowds for the six teams and venues in Major League Cricket situated across the United States.\n\nThe question now for Major League Cricket and all involved is whether the competition is sustainable in an already jam-packed schedule for both domestic and international cricket.\n\nAppeal\n\nTaking cricket into the mainstream of US audiences has always been a dream of the International Cricket Council, but there has never been the right demand. Challenging the entrenched hierarchy of baseball as America’s summer sport is always going to be a daunting prospect and it won’t change any time soon.\n\nAudiences have responded to Major League Cricket, selling out the six stadia over a three-week period. The news will please the ownership groups of all six franchises, but there will be the desire to see the league expand in the coming years if it can sustain its success and appeal to American fans. It has been popular too among the leading betting sites in the United States, who have all carried MLC odds for individual games and futures markets.\n\nSo, there is plenty of evidence that there is a foundation for Major League Cricket to build on.\n\nThe inaugural Major League Cricket season had only 19 games in its schedule, including four playoff games. Compared to over major T20 leagues in the world, the competition is a small one, which could well play into its hands given the schedule.\n\nAmerican fans may appreciate the novelty of a short sharp competition that allows them to enjoy a niche sport for a couple of weeks before tuning back into baseball. The problem Major League Cricket will have is to determine whether these fans are enjoying the novelty for one season or whether it can be sustained over a period of time.\n\nOther T20 leagues around the world have benefitted from being situated in countries where cricket already has a strong following, notably South Africa where SA20 was launched in 2023. The structure of the league is similar to Major League Cricket, where the franchises were also owned by the leading IPL outfits. SA20 enjoyed a fruitful first season, but they too will have the issue of sustainability over a long period of time, including one of the key issues that could make or break Major League Cricket.\n\nAvailability\n\nThe primary issue that Major League Cricket faces is its competition. It fits into the international cricket schedule at the height of the English summer, meaning that none of the major England stars will be available unless a gap can be made.\n\nRoy decided to make the move to Major League Cricket by sacrificing his England incremental contract and turning his back on the opportunity to play for his county Surrey for their Vitality Blast campaign. Roy is an extreme case and has made his intentions clear that he is a white-ball specialist, but the revitalisation of the England Test team under Ben Stokes may result in players opting to make themselves available for all red-ball matches in the future.\n\nThe likes of Stokes, Harry Brook, Jonny Bairstow, and Mark Wood who specialise in both red-ball and white-ball formats will not turn their backs on their lucrative England contracts. So, there could be a problem attracting the top-tier English talent and whichever teams are touring England during their summer months, which coincide with the Major League Cricket season. Unless the campaign can be shifted to a more amenable period those players will not be available.\n\nEven the IPL has had its issues securing the best English talent, despite offering huge salaries.\n\nThere are other issues too. The Global T20 Canada is played at the same time, which steered a portion of players away from MLC north of the border, notably England opener Alex Hales among others from New Zealand such as Tim Southee and Colin de Grandhomme and West Indies’ superstar Chris Gayle.\n\nMajor League Cricket will need to open up lines of communication to prevent a crossover, allowing both competitions to take advantage of the top players that are available in the summer months.\n\nContracts\n\nRoy’s example of tearing up his England contract to play in Major League Cricket is an interesting precedent, which may begin to rear its head across the sport. Mumbai Indians have already locked up players to represent their teams across all T20 competitions such as Dewald Brevis.\n\nRajasthan Royals are looking to follow suit by tempting Jos Buttler with a four-year contract that would secure the England white-ball captain’s services for the IPL and their other franchises Paarl Royals in SA20 and the Barbados Royals in the Caribbean Premier League. Jofra Archer is another player who has reportedly been offered a lucrative deal by Mumbai Indians.\n\nIf players were to accept those contracts it would threaten to tear up the fabric of the game as countries would be forced to ask permission of franchises to allow their players to represent their nations. It is undoubtedly an exciting time in cricket, and although there have only been a few players to take the plunge and accept franchise-only deals at the moment, there may come a time when it spreads throughout the game.\n\nNew Zealand’s Trent Boult opted to take a step back from international cricket, while numerous other players are considering rationing their availability for all formats amid the packed schedule.\n\nThese contracts could work in the favour of Major League Cricket because of the six teams’ affiliation with their IPL partners. If Archer were to sign with the Indians, he would be available to play for MI New York instead of featuring for England in their summer. It would be at Archer’s discretion what team to choose.\n\nWe’re just entering the infancy of these contracts, but outside of the big three nations of India, Australia, and England, international teams are struggling to match the financial packages that can be provided to players from franchise cricket in all corners of the globe.\n\nThe MLC and other leagues could soon be flooded with superstars from around the world that will focus on T20 competitions rather than all formats.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nMajor League Cricket has arrived at a pivotal moment in the history of the game, and its development could well dictate the future of how players are handled between the franchise revolution and the status quo of the international game.\n\nHowever, there are issues that need to be addressed, notably whether MLC is just a novelty for an American audience and interest could quickly wane after a couple of seasons. It may also need to work on its place in the cricketing calendar to avoid other major competitions, especially in England, where luring stars could further boost its profile.\n\nThe first season has been a success commercially and it has the chance to be a building block for a permanent place in the US sporting zeitgeist.",

The league's ability to attract top-tier English talent, who are often busy with international commitments, is a challenge. Additionally, the league needs to navigate its place in the cricketing calendar to avoid conflicts with other major competitions.\n\n**Contracts and Player Availability**\nMLC's affiliation with IPL franchises could work in its favor, as players like Jofra Archer, who have been offered lucrative contracts, may choose to play for their IPL teams over representing their national teams. This could lead to a shift in the way players prioritize their commitments.\n\n**Future Outlook**\nThe future of MLC depends on its ability to sustain interest and appeal to American audiences beyond the initial novelty. The league needs to address its place in the cricketing calendar, avoid conflicts with other competitions, and navigate the complexities of player contracts and availability.",

You sort of um and ah about that time of the year about where you're going to be and whether you take the time off, whether you play the Hundred or what you might do and I think just having those couple of Aussies there and I think the opportunity to be a part of something really big in MLC and grow something is really exciting as well.\"\n\nMaxwell joins Head, Smith, Adam Zampa (Los Angeles Knight Riders), Spencer Johnson (Knight Riders), Tim David (MI New York), Matt Short (San Franciso Unicorns) and Jake Fraser-McGurk (San Franciso Unicorns) as confirmed Australian signings for the second season of MLC, with more expected to join for the tournament which starts immediately after the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies ends on June 29.\n\nMeanwhile, Maxwell has moved to clarify his decision to ask to be omitted from RCB's line-up from the last IPL match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Maxwell explained that it had nothing to do with needing to take an extended break from the tournament. He simply felt like he was not in the best XI and wanted to take any tough conversations away from captain Faf du Plessis and coach Andy Flower by asking to be dropped.\n\n\"I was pretty low on confidence,\" Maxwell said. \"I had a good couple of net sessions and just went out to the ground and felt really tentative. I wasn't able to really commit to my game plans and just felt like if I had kept playing and playing that role, I don't think the results would change too much.\n\n2:51\n\nGlenn Maxwell to join Washington Freedom in MLC\n\n\"So I just went to Faf and said, look, I think we need to try someone else in my position and had the same conversation with Andy Flower, the coach, and to me it was a bit of a no-brainer. I think it sort of saves the tough conversation they might have to have about dropping me.\n\n\"I felt really at peace with it. Obviously, I'm frustrated that I wasn't able to get the results I would have liked but comfortable in the fact that I know I feel like I've made the right decision for the team and it's certainly not like I'm taking an extended break away from the game.\n\n\"I just think it's a better opportunity for someone else to have a crack at my position. I know I'm an important part of this side but at the moment I'm not playing well enough to I suppose warrant a spot.\"\n\nMaxwell revealed he is unlikely to come back in for the next game, against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, given he is battling a minor hip injury. He said he understands he has to bide his time to get another opportunity.\n\n\"I've actually got a little bit of a hip strain so I've got a few more days off and during recovery,\" Maxwell said. \"So I've got a little period here where I'm still training, still trying to get myself right. If there is a spot that becomes available, I'll obviously put my hand up and take it\n\n\"It's not one of those things where I've set a date that I'll be out for three games then I'll come back whenever I'm ready. That's that's not how it works. I haven't been at a level that's good enough to warrant a spot on the side this year.\"\n\nAlex Malcolm is an associate editor at ESPNcricinfo",

    "body": "Topline\n\nA New York cricket team owned by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's family defeated a squad partly controlled by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Sunday in the inaugural championship match for Major League Cricket, the latest attempt to bring the hugely popular international sport into the U.S. mainstream.\n\nKey Facts\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nWe estimate Ambani’s net worth to be $91 billion, making him the 15th richest person in the world and the richest man in India, ahead of Gautam Adani ($54.9 billion). Nadella’s shares of Microsoft were worth about $261 million as of Monday.\n\nKey Background\n\nIn late 2022, league officials announced the inaugural season of Major League Cricket after years of delays caused by construction setbacks on the league’s main stadium in Texas, where half the matches were played. The season lasted three weeks and featured six teams playing Twenty20 cricket, a shortened version of the sport. The teams, representing cities and states across the country—New York, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Texas, San Francisco and Los Angeles—played all their matches between two stadiums in Texas and North Carolina. USA Cricket, which has officially sanctioned the league, has said that Major League Cricket is part of its official strategy to turn cricket, which is already incredibly popular in India, Pakistan and Australia, into a mainstream U.S. sport and to become a full member of the International Cricket Council by 2030. It’s not the first effort to create a cricket market in the U.S. though. 2004 saw the first attempt at professional cricket in the U.S. with startup league Pro Cricket. That league folded after just one season. In 2015, a series of exhibition matches were hosted across the U.S. by legendary Australian and Indian cricketers Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar. Meanwhile, this new league comes ahead of the 2024 Twenty20 World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the U.S. and the West Indies. Outside of the United States, cricket is a massively popular—and lucrative—sport: Five-year broadcasting rights to the Indian Premier League sold for $6.2 billion last year, a higher per-game value than any other sports league aside from the NFL.\n\nTangent\n\nNita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani and the face of the family’s cricket enterprises, brought a whole couch to the stadium to watch Sunday’s match in comfort, ESPN journalist Peter Della Penna reported.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"Just look at the atmosphere here,” Nita Ambani told reporters. “It looks like a festival of cricket. I think MLC is a momentous step in the development of cricket in this region.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nMajor League Cricket Starts With A Bang In America Despite Obstacles (Forbes)\n\nBroadcast Rights For India’s Top Cricket League Sell For $6.2 Billion, Value Per Game Second Only To NFL (Forbes)",

But here to see two or three hours of unabashed fun, I'm a convert.\"\n\nCricket's only previous appearance at the Olympics was during the 1900 Games in Paris, where a team from Great Britain defeated France in a lone match.\n\n\"This is a great day for the Olympic movement, a great day for India, a great day for the United States and a great day for cricket fans everywhere,\" said Garcetti.\n\n\"I think it will ignite a new generation of cricket players and cricket fans... We think that this format is perfect for the Olympics, perfect for cricket, and no better place to launch than here, in the middle of cricket madness.\"\n\nThe Indian Premier League, featuring the game's global stars, has cemented India's position as the unquestioned economic driving force of the sport, thanks to legions of fans and lucrative broadcasting deals in a nation where the game is almost a religion.\n\nMonday's vote also took place while India stages the men's 50-over Cricket World Cup.\n\nMajor League Cricket, a professional Twenty20 League, launched in the United States in July, with the US a co-host of next year's men's T20 World Cup together with territories in the West Indies.\n\n\"By the time of the Olympics, not only Major League Cricket will be significant in the US, we'll have the facilities and the fanbase,\" said Garcetti.\n\nOn a more serious note, Garcetti voiced his support for the concept of the Olympic truce, amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"The tradition of the Olympics was the Olympic truce,\" he said.\n\n\"In ancient times, everybody put down their weapons to have sports unite us...

    "body": "The inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket competition has got underway in the United States of America, with the first leg of the matches being played out at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas.\n\nA lot of impressive performances have already been on display, with some of them quite frankly taking our breath away. The standard of the game has been phenomenal.\n\nMI New York and Texas Super Kings have dominated the competition so far, with the likes of Seattle Orcas and Washington Freedom coming into their own as well. Los Angeles Knight Riders, a subsidiary of Kolkata Knight Riders of the Indian Premier League, have had perhaps the worst showing so far, losing both the matches that they have played and that too by big margins.\n\nA lot of local American players have caught our eye, too. Since this tournament is, in a way, meant to provide them with a pathway and help them develop, we have compiled a listicle of three such names who have impressed us the most.\n\nHere are three local players to watch out for in Major League Cricket 2023.\n\n#3. Ali Khan (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\nExpress fast bowler Ali Khan, who turns out for the Los Angeles Knight Riders in the competition, is one of the brightest stars of American cricket. Known to possess decent pace, Khan can swing the ball too, often getting it to angle across the right-handers who come across him.\n\nKhan can also bowl yorkers consistently, and this is what makes him different from others of his ilk. He has picked up four wickets so far in the competition, having bagged a couple of wickets each in the two games that the Knight Riders have played so far, against the Texas Super Kings and MI New York.\n\nDespite his team doing poorly in this competition, Khan has done well individually. He has been seen hurrying the batters for pace, and with the prized scalp of Nicholas Pooran in his pocket, his confidence is only bound to soar further.\n\n#2. Shayan Jahangir (MI New York)\n\nMI New York have had a poor start to this competition so far, winning one and losing two. Although he was not a part of their first game against San Francisco, Shayan Jahangir found his way into the team for the next two matches.\n\nHe failed to perform against Los Angeles Knight Riders but scored a fabulous 41 against Texas Super Kings. Born in Karachi, Pakistan, Jahangir is the regular wicketkeeper for the USA national team but plays as a batter in MLC, given the presence of Nicholas Pooran behind the stumps.\n\nA calm presence at the crease, Jahangir did well in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifiers held recently in Zimbabwe, with a brilliant century against Nepal being the icing on the cake. His ability to use his feet against the spinners has often come in handy in MLC.\n\nIf Jahangir continues in this vein of form, MI New York's batting worries might be solved very soon.\n\n#1. Mohammad Mohsin (Texas Super Kings)\n\nOne of the biggest stories of the inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket competition is that of Mohammad Mohsin.\n\nLeft out of the initial draft, Mohsin was disappointed but managed to keep a smile on his face. He was picked up by the Texas Super Kings in the wildcard round just seven days before the tournament began, and now has seven wickets to his name! He is also the leading wicket-taker of the tournament at the time of writing.\n\nMohsin starred in his debut game itself, picking up 4/8 against Los Angeles Knight Riders, and followed it up with 1/28 against Washington Freedom and 2/36 against MI New York. His captain Faf du Plessis is extremely pleased with him, owing to the wide variety of tricks the leg-spinner has in his bag.\n\nBorn in Peshawar, Pakistan, Mohsin has played seven first-class matches and an equal number of List A games. Watching a leggie is always easy on the eye, and that is especially the case with Mohsin. With impeccable control over his length and drift, he can go on to achieve a lot of big things.",

    "title": "Major League Cricket: The grand plan to make America love T20",
    "date": "Wed Dec 23 10:41:51 2020",
    "body": "Major League Cricket: Silicon Valley and Bollywood’s grand plan to make America fall in love with T20\n\nPeople don’t tend to associate the game of cricket with the United States.\n\nThe world’s second most popular sport has an estimated global following of 2.5bn, yet has struggled to attract an audience in the US, where American football, baseball, and basketball dominate the live sport broadcasting schedule.\n\nBut a group of investors that includes chief executives of tech giants and a Bollywood film star are seeking to change that with the launch of Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nWhat is Major League Cricket?\n\nThe Twenty20 cricket competition, scheduled to launch in 2022, will feature six franchises. Dallas and Los Angeles have already been confirmed as team locations.\n\nMLC’s organisers hope that the competition can repeat the success of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which has rapidly become one of the world’s most-viewed sports leagues.\n\nThe competition’s launch is also a key part of USA Cricket’s foundational plan, which aims to grow cricket’s American following and improve the quality of the national team.\n\nA 24-team sister competition, called Minor League Cricket, begins next spring and will serve as a pipeline to MLC.\n\nUSA Cricket is targeting full membership of the International Cricket Council by 2030.\n\nThe governing body is also set to spend at least $10m to renovate the AirHogs Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nThe 6,000-seat facility will become a cricket-exclusive venue, hosting Dallas’s MLC franchise and functioning as a high-performance centre for young American players.\n\n“We have been encouraged by the great progress that we have been able to make across a number of different areas despite the obvious challenges of these times,” said Paraag Marathe, the chairman of USA Cricket, earlier this year. We anticipate that our growth will accelerate now that the organisational direction has been very clearly set.”\n\nWho are the key figures behind it?\n\nSome influential US business leaders are cricket lovers who want to increase the sport’s American following.\n\nMost notable among them is Satya Nadella, Microsoft chief executive and lifelong cricket fan.\n\nUnder Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft is expanding its main campus with the Richmond, Washington site building a world-class cricket pitch.\n\n“Technology and cricket go together perfectly,” says cricketer turned journalist Simon Hughes. “Many CEOs of US tech giants are of South Asian origin and love cricket.”\n\nHughes co-wrote his latest book, A New Innings, with Manoj Badale, owner of the IPL’s Rajasthan Royals.\n\nIt argues that Indian-American tech executives like Nadella, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Pepsi’s Indra Nooyi will support the sport’s planned expansion to the US.\n\nIndian actor Shah Rukh Khan, labelled by some media as the “King of Bollywood”, is also investing in MLC.\n\nKhan is a co-owner of the IPL’s Kolkata Knight Riders, and will own the MLC’s Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n“Undoubtedly, other IPL and privately-owned franchises may invest in MLC,” says Hughes.\n\nCan Major League Cricket succeed?\n\nDespite significant investment from businessmen such as Nadella and Khan, MLC will have to overcome several major obstacles.\n\n“The Big Four leagues [NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL] effectively crowd out sports from the likes of media and sponsorship markets,” says Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport business at Emlyon Business School.\n\n“Sports such as cricket, in the short- to medium-term, typically find it extremely difficult to overcome such barriers.”\n\nHowever, MLC’s founders are confident that their new initiative can succeed where other attempts to establish cricket in the US, such as Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar’s 2015 Cricket All-Stars series, have failed.\n\nMajor League Soccer, which has achieved sustainable growth through engagement with Hispanic communities, offers some lessons, says Chadwick.\n\n“US consumers are predisposed towards spending on sport, and there are several diasporas in the US that may already be engaged with cricket,” Chadwick says.\n\nBy some estimates, there may be 6m Americans of Indian and South Asian origin, many already cricket fans.\n\nMLC has already signed a broadcasting contract with Willow TV, a pay television sports channel. It airs overseas cricket events and targets much of its advertising to Americans of Indian or South Asian origin.\n\nThe success of North America’s first T20 League, the Global T20 Canada, will also encourage MLC’s founders.\n\nThe Canadian tournament marked itself out by attracting high-profile international players including Chris Gayle, Shahid Afridi and Steve Smith.\n\nHughes says that the lessons from the IPL, Global T20 Canada, and other franchise T20 competitions are straightforward.\n\n“Get the best players, and make sure they’re shared out so all teams are roughly equal in terms of ability.”\n\nIf MLC successfully follows that formula, cricket could finally gain a foothold in the world’s largest sport economy.",
    "summary": "**What is MLC?**: MLC is a Twenty20 cricket competition scheduled to launch in 2022, featuring six franchises, with Dallas and Los Angeles already confirmed as team locations.\n\n**Objective**: The tournament aims to increase cricket's popularity in the US, following the success of the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\n**Key figures**: Investors include technology giants' CEOs, such as Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, who will own the Los Angeles Knight Riders franchise.\n\n**Growth plan**: MLC is part of USA Cricket's foundational plan to grow cricket's American following and improve the national team. A 24-team Minor League Cricket competition will serve as a pipeline to MLC.\n\n**Challenges**: MLC will face obstacles, including competing with established American sports leagues for media and sponsorship attention.\n\n**Confidence**: Founders are optimistic, citing the success of the Indian Premier League and the potential to engage with existing cricket fans among the 6 million Americans of Indian and South Asian origin.",

This is the second title for the MI family in the year 2023, as MI Women’s team also won the inaugural WPL trophy.\n\nMajor League Cricket is a great initiative to promote the sport in the biggest sports market i.e., the United States of America. After the Minor League Cricket, which was the foundation of the Major League Cricket, MLC was successfully launched on the 14th of July 2023, with six teams participating in the inaugural season.\n\nOut of the six teams, three had parent franchises in the Indian Premier League. Texas Super Kings is owned by the Super Kings family, MI New York from the Mumbai Indians family and LA Knight Riders is owned by the Knight Riders group. The other three teams were; Washington Freedom, Seattle Orcas, and San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nFaf Du Plessis led Texas, Kieron Pollard captained the MI New York, Aaron Finch led the San Francisco Unicorns, Sunil Narine led the LA Knight Riders, Wayne Parnell was leading the Seatle Orcas, and Moises Henriques led the Washington Freedom Team.\n\nWinners of the inaugural Major League Cricket\n\nMI New York, led by Kieron Pollard, were nowhere near the playoffs after losing two of their first three games. It was the last game of the league stage that changed the fortunes of the team.\n\nWell, one can say that Nicholas Pooran changed the fortunes of the team. He was just impeccable throughout the tournament. His golden run continued in MLC as well. Sadly, his team won’t be featuring in the upcoming World Cup despite his exceptional performances.\n\nIt was a tough road for MINY to get to the final when they struggled to make it to the playoffs. But MI did what MI does, and we saw a whole different team in the knockout stage. Dewald Brevis and Tim David were no less as Brevis helped MI New York perform well in the Playoffs. And then Nicky Phammered the Seattle Orcas in the Final with his knock of 137 runs off just 55 deliveries.\n\nPooran became the highest scorer of the tournament, with 388 runs in just eight innings averaging nearly 65. And Trent Boult, who was also a part of this team, became the highest wicket-taker of the season with 22 wickets in just eight innings.\n\nApart from these guys, MINY also had Rashid Khan, David Wiese, Kagiso Rabada and a few local players. Despite this much strength and experience in the team, MINY suffered earlier in the tournament but eventually had a fairytale ending with the Caribbean brothers adding one more trophy to the MI cabinet.\n\nThe success of the MLC 2023\n\nThe inaugural season of the Major League Cricket was a successful stint as players from all over the world took part. Players like Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Dwayne Bravo, Devon Conway and many more were a part of this new and delightful league.\n\nEven Glenn Maxwell believes that MLC will attract the cricketers more as they will get to travel to the USA once a year.\n\nFor the local players, like Cameron Gannon, who was named the domestic player of the tournament, it was a great opportunity to have international players in their dressing room with highly experienced support staff.\n\nMajor League Cricket will not just take the US cricket forward but also help them grow and get recognition at the international level, and it will be no surprise if we see the USA cricket team in the next World Cup.",

    "title": "The 2024 Major League Cricket Domestic Draft: low on hype, high on drama",
    "date": "Sun Mar 24 06:52:29 2024",
    "body": "It’s been a year since the inaugural MLC Draft was presented to great fanfare at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. The theme of space travel, the final frontier, teased the imagination of cricket enthusiasts who have long wondered what a mainstream American breakthrough would do for cricket. Fans and curious observers could follow the 2023 MLC Domestic Draft as it unfurled live on YouTube, and some even traveled hundreds of miles to bear witness in-person.\n\nThis year’s draft took place remotely and was not broadcast or streamed live. Instead, Major League Cricket provided a recap video on their MLC Network YouTube channel as a “premiere.” Hosts Nikhil Uttamchandani and Aaman Patel knowledgeably summarized Tuesday night’s events, interviewed players, and announced a few star overseas names.\n\nBut in spite of the downgrade in hype, budget, and allegory, the 2024 MLC Domestic Draft is a unique, strategic, and creative thing to dissect.\n\nA new draft format\n\nBy the end of Thursday night’s 2024 Major League Cricket Domestic Player Draft and Season Preview, the names and draft positions of 20 domestic cricketers were announced, 13 of which would be joining MLC squads for the very first time.\n\nMLC’s sophomore domestic draft class will join 33 previously retained domestics across Major League Cricket’s six teams making 53 domestics so far, with a supplemental draft scheduled for June 16 to fill out the squads.\n\nWhile last year’s domestic draft was a simple snake draft, teams would be heading into this year’s draft with varying purse and team sizes. This imbalance necessitated an entirely new approach full of new wrinkles and challenges.\n\nWith ten pay levels replacing “rounds,” decreasing incrementally from $75,000 to $10,000, plus a $5,000 U23 round, teams would have the option to draft, in turn, at each pay level, provided they had the purse available to do so. Teams could also draft twice at each pay level, if they still had the available purse, and only after other teams had a fair opportunity.\n\nHeading into the draft, Texas Super Kings had the largest purse available at $150,000 with a maximum of three slots to fill. This meant that TSK could take one player at the $75,000 round, another at the next highest pay level of $65,000, and still have $10,000 left over to take a final player. Or, if they felt that the market was in their favor and their target would still be available at the next pay level, they could take two players at $65,000 and a third at $20,000. The potential combinations would be limited by their remaining purse after each pick, the available draft pool at each level, and their anticipation of other teams’ priorities and purse.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Seattle had only $60,000 available. The Orcas could draft as many as four players, but wouldn’t be able to pick a player until the $35,000 pay level at the earliest.\n\nSeattle’s small purse could be seen as validation of a job well done by the franchise in 2023. Four of Seattle’s retained domestics were drafted in the first four rounds, and their fifth retained player was drafted in the sixth. “We were very pleased with our Season One draft picks,” Seattle Co-Owner Sanjay Parthasarathy told Emerging Cricket. “Our domestic players’ consistent performances throughout the first season gave us the opportunity to retain them and to focus on specific roles for Season Two.”\n\nThe draft order was determined by the reverse finish in last year’s table, meaning LA Knight Riders ($115k purse) would pick first, followed by SF Unicorns ($110k), Washington Freedom ($70k), Texas Super Kings ($150k), Seattle Orcas ($60k) and MI New York ($95k).\n\nBy the time the dust had settled, $570,000 would be spent in total.\n\nEarly surprises\n\nThe first “round,” the $75,000 pay level, would kick off with only four teams holding enough purse to make a bid. LA Knight Riders had the first opportunity, and surprised many by selecting Adithya Ganesh. The 32 year old veteran from Tamil Nadu featured as a wicketkeeper for East Bay Blazers in 2023 in the West division of Minor League Cricket. In 2023, Ganesh’s Impact Per Innings of 4.8 ranked 25th among batters with more than five innings in MiLC. This rating essentially put Ganesh at 4.8 runs better than replacement (league average) per game in 2023.\n\nLAKR’s pick of Ganesh left San Francisco with the opportunity to draft their prime target, Hassan Khan.\n\n“Looking ahead at the draft, we had Khan as our number one ranked player and not having that first selection, there’s always a fear of the things you can’t control,” San Francisco’s Graham Manou explained. “Despite having had a look at what other teams needed philosophically, we thought ‘You know Khan might not be available being the best player in the draft’ and it’s something that, at most drafts, generally you do tend to see the best players go.”\n\n“We were obviously a little bit surprised, but extremely happy to be able to secure Khan at that price point. We saw a lot of value in what he could potentially bring for the group, particularly with the international players that we are currently compiling.”\n\nIt only took a short stint in Minor League Cricket in 2023 for Khan to establish himself as a legitimate star. Khan’s 182 strike rate and 220 runs in 5 innings was enough to lead all batters in Impact Per Game at 20.1, more than two runs better than league runner up Corey Anderson’s 17.8. With the ball, Khan was equally impressive, ranking eighth in Impact Per Over, saving his team 2.39 runs per over better than the league average thanks to 11 wickets at a 4.89 economy. That he put up these figures in the Central division, the toughest in Minor League Cricket, was enough to plant him firmly as the favorite to be selected first overall. And as a left arm orthodox all rounder, Khan fulfilled a glaring need for the Unicorns, who took only 6 wickets with spin in 2023.\n\nBut the selection of their top rated cricketer didn’t come without a high cost. Spending $75,000 on a single slot left the Unicorns with only $35,000 for their final three players. And with their U23 slot currently occupied by Sanjay Krishnamurthy, each remaining player would cost at least $10,000. This reduced the Unicorns to spectators until at least the $15,000 round.\n\nTexas delivered the next big surprise, taking young wicket keeper Joshua Tromp as the final player in the $75,000 round. Only a few days shy of 19 years old, Joshua finally clicked at the Minor League Cricket level in 2023, after watching his twin brother Matthew get drafted in the U23 round of the 2023 MLC Draft by Seattle. With 362 runs at a 133 strike rate in a finishing role for Houston in the Central Division, Joshua’s 6.5 Impact Per Match ranked him 15th overall, just ahead of LAKR’s Nitish Kumar (6.1). Though he was fairly certain to get picked before the U23 round, few would have predicted that an 18 year old would go 3rd overall at the $75,000 pay level.\n\nLA Knight Riders, SF Unicorns, and Washington Freedom did not have the cap space to pick in the $65,000 round, leaving Texas Super Kings to make their move and draft Raj Nannan.\n\nThough his numbers during the 2023 Minor League Cricket season were a bit exaggerated, thanks to the bowling friendly wickets in the East Division, Nannan was a consistent, reliable star producer in Minor League Cricket for The Philadelphians. His 2023 MiLC Impact Per Over ranked just behind Washington Freedom and USA Cricket star Saurabh Netravalkar at -1.82, meaning he saved his team nearly two runs per over better than the league average bowler. And he batted well on those difficult wickets.\n\nNannan was the second of what would be six left arm orthodox bowlers taken in the MLC Domestic Draft in 2024, indicating that perhaps MLC franchises are taking note of what many have long considered a position of national strength.\n\nThe only other team with enough cap space to pick in the $65,000 round was MI New York.\n\nThe purses were quickly getting smaller, and every team except TSK had at least two slots left to fill. LAKR had $40k in space for up to four slots, SF had $35k for up to four slots, Washington had $70k for up to four slots, TSK had $10k for one slot, and Seattle had $60k for up to four slots. This put MINY firmly in the driver’s seat with $95k in cap space with up to five slots to fill.\n\nTeams did not have to end the draft with a full domestic roster, and could fill out their squads with the Supplemental Draft in June. However, each team had to leave the draft with their $5,000 U23 slot filled.\n\nNew York could yield their turn to pick in the $65k round in hopes of landing their man in the $60k round, or even the $50k round, without much worry that any team would spend the vast majority of their purse to pick ahead of them. Only Washington could really threaten their pick, but with four players still needed, it was unlikely that Washington would spend that much on just one player in the $50k round, and certainly not in the $60k round.\n\nNevertheless, New York shockingly opted not to test Washington at all, and selected Ruben Clinton immediately in the $65,000 round.\n\nRuben Clinton took on a compiler role for Socal Lashings in Minor League Cricket, as his team fought to stay relevant in a crowded playoff race punching slightly above their weight in the competitive West. As a result of this batting approach, Ruben’s Impact Per Match rating was exactly 0.0, making him one of two MiLC batters (along with Surf Rider and former USA Cricket all rounder Marty Kain) to finish 2023 exactly at league average production per innings.\n\nIn spite of his average production in MiLC in 2023, Clinton impressed during the 2024 Men’s T20 National Championship in Houston just before the draft, clearly catching the eye of MINY scouts when he finished his first ever USA Cricket tournament game as the Man of the Match with two wickets and 30 runs scored. Ruben ended the Nationals as the sixth leading run scorer, along with three wickets at an economy of 4.75.\n\nThe high draft position must have buoyed Clinton after he fell through the cracks with USA Cricket selectors. In spite of his top ten performance with both bat and ball, Ruben wasn’t asked to join the USA Men’s Training Squad following the National Championships.\n\nConsidering the retention of 2023 first pick Steven Taylor, Ruben gives MINY two left hand batting openers who bowl right arm finger spin. This means New York has $130,000 of their domestic purse tied up in one role.\n\nSeattle and Washington make their move\n\nTeams moved through the $60k, $50k, and $40k rounds without a player taken, as only Washington had the purse space to reasonably make a selection.\n\nAt the $35,000 round, Washington had a difficult choice to make. If they passed up their turn, Seattle could easily select one of their targets, considering that Seattle had $60k in space. But if they waited another round, they could potentially double up and still have money left over for solid contributors.\n\nSeattle, already happy with their retained domestics, could either pass on the $35k round, or ensure that they get their guy right now.\n\nSeattle’s guy turned out to be 2021 Minor League Cricket MVP and 2023 MLC and MiLC champion Hammad Azam. And the $35k round seemed like a great place to claim their first pick of the draft.\n\n“Our plan was to get three or four role players, because it’s a longer season this year,” Parthasarathy explained. “As always, we rely on a combination of data and a player’s fit with our team’s character and system. Hammad was at the top on both counts, so we were happy to get him.”\n\nWhile Hammad certainly gives Seattle variety, depth and experience, his selection left the Orcas with $25k in cap space for up to three more players. This put Seattle out of contention for the $25k and $20k rounds.\n\nAs it worked out, it also left Washington with their preferred targets still in the pool and the largest purse going at $70k.\n\nWashington would indeed spend two picks in the $25,000 round. First up, Hampshire all-rounder Ian Holland, a versatile veteran of 21 international games for USA Cricket. Holland has proved to be a key role player as the third fast bowler for USA Cricket, taking 29 wickets in 21 matches across ODI and T20i, while adding over 400 runs in 17 innings. Holland has also accumulated 68 First Class and 51 List A matches.\n\nNext, left arm orthodox spinner Amila Aponso, San Francisco’s Wild Card (supplemental) selection in 2023. A veteran of 12 international matches for Sri Lanka, Amila has starred for Atlanta Fire since 2021, currently sixth in wickets all time in Minor League Cricket with 55 in 41 innings at a 5.84 economy.\n\n“We were surprised that Ian Holland went through that low,” Washington Freedom General Manager, Michael Klinger told EC. “We could have picked him up earlier. We took a calculated risk because we only had a small amount of salary cap left. We wanted at least three, if not four, different skill sets amongst that. So we took a calculated risk that he would slip through a touch lower.”\n\n“We also obviously were making sure we kept an eye on other teams’ salary remaining once it got to those levels and the percentages were in our favor to continue, to let it go a couple more rounds. And with the rules in the draft, you’re allowed to pick up two players in the same round as long as everyone else passes and it comes back to your turn.”\n\n“Strategically, once it got to 25, we knew with 70k salary left that to spend 50k on the two main players we were after was the best way to go. So we went for 25 and 25 for Holland and Amila Aponso, who we felt was the best left arm orthodox in the draft with the most experience, and played the highest level of cricket.”\n\n“We felt getting those two in our first two draft picks was pretty much what we were after.”\n\nLAKR and SF Unicorns play it safe; MINY and Seattle bet on youth\n\nThe $20,000 round saw two fast bowlers selected. LAKR brought back Corne Dry, their fifth pick from 2023, but this time at half the cost. Corne has established himself as one of the top fast bowlers in the USA over the past three seasons for Atlanta Fire, where he’s third all time in wickets in MiLC with 72 in 42 matches. A tough rookie season in MLC kept him from being retained at a higher fee.\n\nCorne’s Atlanta rival Heath Richards, of MiLC’s Lightning, was scooped up next by MINY. Richards, injured much of 2023, finished 2022 with an Impact Per Over rating of -1.34, good enough for 28th in Minor League Cricket, after taking 14 wickets in 12 innings.\n\nThe $15,000 round was on deck, and it was time for San Francisco to rejoin the action. Coming into the round, they had a strong domestic fast bowler corps in Liam Plunkett, Carmi LeRoux and Brody Couch; talented left arm spinning all-rounders Hassan Khan and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (U23); and sensational middle order batter Corey Anderson. But among those not retained from 2023 was third round pick and batter Tajinder Singh.\n\nWhile Tajinder didn’t live up to his third round price point in 2023 (only 22 runs in 5 innings), he presented a safe option for San Francisco at the $15,000 price point.\n\n“We felt it was really important to maintain our core group of players in the Quicks, you know, they’re a valuable commodity” Manou explained. “We feel we’re pretty fortunate with those that we’ve got in Carmi, Liam, and Brody. And obviously Corey’s an outstanding and proven player and Sanjay is a fantastic young talent and individual.”\n\n“So we needed to create some space. And Tajinder was probably one of those players that we saw a lot of value in what he could potentially bring for the group, particularly with the international players that we are currently compiling. So when it got to our selection, we certainly considered the role that we felt he could play, and there are multiple roles I think that Tajinder can offer. Having him available at that point was great. A known commodity, someone that we’ve really enjoyed working with to date was a no-brainer for us and we’re really looking forward to having Tajinder back.”\n\nWith a talented batting all-rounder in Hammad Azam already in the bag for Seattle and $25k remaining in their budget, the Orcas were feeling good about their domestic squad. But rather than risk waiting through a sure to be busy $10k round, Seattle decided to take their pick at the $15k round, and then fill out the rest of the team with a U23 and a June supplemental pick.\n\nThe best available player on their board at this point was 21 year old left arm orthodox all-rounder Ali Sheikh, who had been selected in the 6th round in 2023 by LAKR but not retained. Ali continued to build his resume in Minor League Cricket in 2023, helping his Dallas Mustangs to the league title, with an Impact Per Over rating of -0.5 with the ball, and an Impact Per Match rating of 3.0 with the bat.\n\nAli famously took guard in the 10th over of 2023 MiLC Final with his team in a 41 for 4 hole and built a 56 run partnership with Nosh Kenjige to revive the innings and help the Mustangs to a 44 run victory over NJ Somerset Cavaliers to claim the league title.\n\n“We want to help develop the pool of domestic players and are committed to developing young players with long-term potential,” Parthasarathy explained. “Having said that, Ali Sheikh is a young player with substantial experience. His strike rate and batting averages are good, and compare favorably with many seasoned players. He is a wonderful fielder and has a great attitude.”\n\nHuge value in the final round\n\nHeading into the $10,000 round, LAKR, SF Unicorns, and Washington Freedom had $20k each to spend. Texas, Seattle and MINY had $10k each. This was the last chance to take a senior domestic cricketer before the U23 round in this draft. Any slots not filled by the end of this draft would have to be filled during the Supplemental Draft on June 16.\n\nAfter drafting a wicket keeper and a fast bowler, LA Knight Riders kicked off the busiest round of the draft with a left arm orthodox bowling all-rounder. Trinidad born Derone Davis, former CPL veteran with Windies U19 experience, earned a place in the draft thanks to three seasons of rock steady performances in MiLC’s East Division. Davis finished 2023 in the conversation for East Division MVP after producing a 4.4 Impact Per Match rating with the bat and a -0.51 Impact Per Over rating with the ball for perennial contenders New Jersey Stallions. On top of his competency with bat and ball, Davis seemed to make a jaw-dropping play in the field every single weekend.\n\nSan Francisco was up next. With $20k remaining and two players needed this round, the Unicorns would need to wait for Washington after making their first selection of the round. With plenty of batters and wicket keepers still available, San Francisco would settle on Karima Gore. Overlooked last season after missing the combine, Gore’s resume includes 24 games of International experience for USA Cricket, regular playing time as a part of the Leeward Islands, and a terrific record in Minor League Cricket.\n\nGore has batted more than bowled for Leeward since his last appearance with USA in 2021, but his fielding prowess is almost unmatched in the Associate cricket world. His recent form thrust him into the conversation for Major League Cricket, in spite of a wealth of left arm orthodox options across the country. Just a few days prior to the draft, Gore scored 240 runs in an innings in Antigua’s domestic two day competition. With San Francisco in possession of two left arm orthodox all rounders, Gore gives the team options at a position they’ve clearly got pegged for a domestic. And you won’t find a better option for a 12th man fielder if he fails to crack the playing eleven.\n\nWashington would indeed select in the $10,000 round, making San Francisco wait on their final pick. Lahiru Milantha, TSK’s third round selection in 2023, scored 32 runs in at a 94.11 strike rate and was dropped after two innings while TSK’s overseas keeper Devon Conway finished fourth in runs. This made Milantha an expensive redundancy, but his reputation with the gloves and proficiency as an opener in Minor League Cricket made him an appealing selection to backup star opener and keeper Andries Gous. After three seasons in MiLC, Milantha ranks 12th in runs with 1,031 runs at a 131.67 strike rate in 34 innings. Gous, should he miss games, leaves some big shoes to fill, ranking first in MiLC career runs with 1,579 at a strike rate of 137.9 in 44 innings. The selection of Milantha gives Washington the two highest drafted keepers from the 2023 draft at a bargain total price.\n\n“We were keen to get a spare keeper batter, just in case anything happened to Andries Gous, as it did last year with a calf injury at the back end of the tournament,” Klinger explained. “We’re really happy to get Lahiru Milanth, such a high quality player who’s played for his country, at quite a low (price) level. To be able to get him to play for us, he could also play as a spare batter if required as well.”\n\nWhile Washington’s domestic output in 2023 was among the best in the league, they played the entire season without a left handed batter until the seventh position. Milantha gives Washington more “freedom” to make matchups with their batting order.\n\nThe round then came back to San Francisco, who selected Jahmar Hamilton with the final pick of the draft before the U23 selections. A standout with the gloves and a basher in the late middle order, Hamilton gives the Unicorns an option for another domestic role in their team. A teammate of Karima Gore in the Leeward Islands setup, with one test and one ODI for West Indies to his name, “Pup’s” sensational keeping and explosive finishing have helped solidify Atlanta Fire as a top team in Minor League Cricket.\n\n“We feel really fortunate to have been able to secure Gore and Hamilton,” Manou told EC. “Gore certainly, in conjunction with Khan and our stable of quicks, allows us a few opportunities for how we will strategize with our international players now as we look to fill out our list there. But yeah, two extremely well credentialed cricketers and both currently in really good form.”\n\nWith no U23 needed, San Francisco had wrapped up their 2024 domestic draft, and were happy with their haul.\n\n“It’s nice to have a raft of options to fit in the XI and even Sanjay (Krishnamurthi), who’s still of rookie age, having spent some time with him out here in Australia playing against some of our local and interstate talent. We’re really buoyed by what he can offer in the future and, and possibly even this year he’s gonna fit in nicely if he does get his opportunity.”\n\n“Going back to Hamilton and Gore, again, we’re really, really excited by those two joining our group. And again, it provides some great flexibility to what we’re offering. You just never know what opportunities are around the corner, particularly with the amount of cricket that some of the players are playing with injuries and so forth there, their role and responsibility may be quite impactful as the tournament plays out.”\n\nRookie roulette\n\nThe U23 round began with only LAKR, Washington, Seattle and MINY needing to draft.\n\nLos Angeles, with last season’s U23 Bhaskar Yadram aged out, drafted first and selected Matthew Tromp, twin brother of TSK’s Joshua Tromp. After spending 2023 as Seattle’s U23, Tromp struggled a bit in Minor League Cricket, but his undeniable talent meant that he was sure to be picked up again this year.\n\nWashington, who’s U23 slot was vacated by retained 24 year old offspinner Akilesh Bodugum, picked next and took young USA Cricket leg spinner Yasir Mohammad. With six international matches behind him, Yasir is challenging for a permanent place in the USA squad. At only 21 years of age, Yasir gives Washington a player to develop for years before he ages out.\n\n“We felt he was probably the best leg spinner left in the draft,” Klinger explained. “There’s obviously a couple who are already in other teams. So we did a fair bit of research on him. He’s a confident young player, which is very important in a leg spinner.”\n\n“He’s very good in the field and gives, you know, Ricky and our captain, once that’s named, an option if they want to go with an extra spinner, or a little bit of an X factor in the team. So working with someone like Ricky Ponting and some of our overseas players that we’re going to announce in the coming months, I think he’s going to learn a heap and only going to get better and better.”\n\nTraining camps with overseas partners have been a big part of development for many of the MLC teams, particularly Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington.\n\n“Washington Freedom, in conjunction with Cricket New South Wales, ran a training camp over the BBL period last year. If we’re able to do that again, someone like Yasir to come out and train with the BBL clubs and play matches against high quality opposition is only going to help him going forward as well and help him hopefully make the USA team down the track.”\n\nSeattle surprised some when they didn’t retain 2023 U23 Matthew Tromp. With three players claimed under the age of 24 in the senior rounds, and Matthew taken first overall in the U23 round, it appeared that Seattle had taken an unnecessary risk. But the U23 pool presents a decent amount of talent left to choose from.\n\nLeft arm pacers don’t grow on trees, and Ayan Desai is a rare fruit. Leading the 2023 Socal Lashings bowling attack with 14 wickets in 10 games at an economy of 5.76, the 21 year old ranked 13th in MiLC Impact Per Over at -1.99 in 2023, which was fifth among bowlers who appeared in more than 7 games. Desai had also just been selected to represent the West Zone in the 2024 Men’s T20 National Championships.\n\nWith Desai in the fold, Seattle had ended their domestic draft. Confident with their domestic situation, and happy with their approach and preparation, Seattle will enter the June Supplemental Draft with $5,000 left to spend.\n\n“We are very fortunate to have GMR Sports, co-owners of Delhi Capitals, helping us with our team,” Parthasarathy told EC. “Their advice and relationships have helped us throughout the process.”\n\n“The domestic draft is important to us for multiple reasons,” Parthasarathy continued. “Domestic players are the future of cricket in the USA. Developing the domestic player roster is what will build USA’s national team in the long run. And of course, it’s been shown the world over that domestic players determine the success of teams in franchise tournaments.”\n\nIn 2023, MI New York selected Saideep Ganesh as their U23, but the young opener never joined the team after suffering a back injury. Wicketkeeper Slade Van Staden was flown in from South Africa to fill the role, and even played in a game. But New York did not retain Van Staden, and now picked last in the 2024 U23 round.\n\nRushil Ugarkar, the preferred U21 for the 2023 MiLC Champion Dallas Mustangs, earned his selection thanks to an immense performance in the 2023 MiLC postseason. In three Super Eights games, Ugarkar took 10 wickets at a 7.75 economy, helping Dallas into the final. Though he did not bowl in the Championship Final, his throw from the boundary to runout Adil Bhatti ended the game, officially sealing the championship for the Mustangs.\n\nUgarkar’s selection represented the end of the 2024 MLC Domestic Draft, but the June Supplemental Draft gives a second life to a few quality domestic cricketers who were left out. Any cricket played between now and then is cricket that matters for a fortunate few.\n\nYou’re reading Emerging Cricket — brought to you by a passionate group of volunteers with a vision for cricket to be a truly global sport, and a mission to inspire passion to grow the game.\n\nBe sure to check out our homepage for all the latest news, please subscribe for regular updates, and follow EC on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube.\n\nDon’t know where to start?

    "body": "Major League Cricket has revealed some major players in the business and tech communities intend to spearhead funding for the recently launched league. Led by Microsoft, a Series A and A1 totaling €42 million (approximately US $44 million), plus an additional €72.6 million (US $76 million) are being committed.\n\nOther lead investors include Madrona Venture Group which has specialized in seed and early stage investing since 1995.\n\nThe combined €114.6 million (US $120 million) will be earmarked largely for infrastructure efforts – namely top-of-the-line cricket-specific training centers and stadiums. A facility in Redmond, Washington known as Marymoor Park has been mentioned, along with a former soccer venue and minor league baseball stadium called AirHogs Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nOther targeted sites include improvements to an existing space in Morrisville, North Carolina and a vacant parcel of land totaling 20 acres in Irvine, California southeast of Los Angeles for a 10,000-seat location.\n\nMajor League Cricket hopes to transform the sport’s image from one thought of almost entirely in international circles to one that is far more accessible worldwide.\n\nMadrona and Microsoft both with roots in the Seattle-area have expressed a keen interest in expanding beyond the estimated 3,500-person existing cricket community and three adult cricket leagues.\n\nYouth programs have experienced a roughly 500-person increase in participation in recent years. The upstart Seattle thunderbolts, with backing from some tech investors, commenced play in 2021 too.\n\nIf successful, the Marymoor Cricket Community Park would serve as the host for other professional cricket events like the U.S. National Team, a potential World Cup, and Major League Cricket itself. Inclusion of cricket in the 2028 Olympics to be held in Los Angeles is not out of the question too.\n\nMajor League Cricket will specifically focus on the T20 community, which for cricket novices indicates a limit of 20 overs of gameplay. Traditional cricket play has no gameplay limits and often can require multiple days to complete a single match. Since its founding in the early aughts, T20 play is felt by many to be far more appealing to a younger audience with shorter attention spans, which in turn might be more conducive to attracting a heightened level of interest in cricket overall.\n\nThe fundraising news occurs roughly three years after word emerged of USA Cricket’s vision to rain US $1 billion to expand the sport domestically.\n\nMatch play for Major League Cricket will begin in 2023.",

    "body": "Three runs and two wickets off that final over from Daniel Sams. As good as it gets in T20 cricket. MINY wrap up on 137/8. They never really got going and when they did, they got out in quite extraordinary ways. An excellent bowling performance from TSK, they gave just 39 runs away in the last four overs.\n\nThat's two in two for Mohsin. Another googly from him and Pollard seems to know little about it. Ball goes past the inside edge and hits him on the pad, umpire gives it out but Pollard reviews. Bat and pad are quire close and for a second, it looks like Pollard might have got something on it. But the third umpire rules that he has inconclusive evidence and asks the umpire to stay with his decision.\n\nWhat a big wicket this is and what a terrible way for MINY to lose it. Pooran calls for a second run that was just not on. The fielder at deep extra cover comes in and puts in a bullet throw to Conway, who whips off the bails. Replays show that Pooran was well short. Pooran himself was slow to turn and has ran himself out.\n\nWell Steven Taylor's sluggish 15 off 21 came to an end in the ninth over and that might be a boon for MINY because it has brought the dangerous Nicholas Pooran out there. Mohammad Mohsin bowls the second ball of the 10th in his arc and Pooran smashes it over the bowler's head.\n\nMINY's opening stand lasts just eight balls. A fantastic delivery from Theron, full and jagging away late. Monank Patel plays it and edges it to Conway.\n\nMonank Patel c Conway b Theron 0 (2), MINY 4/1 in 1.2 overs\n\nSantner's little dash in the end has helped TSK put up a score of over 150. It hasn't been the most fluid of T20 innings you would ever see. But then if it was difficult for the team batting first, there is a very good chance that it won't be easy for the team batting second.\n\nOff pace delivery from Pollard, Chetty tries to go over long off after coming down the track. No power at all and he holes out to Rashid Khan at long on.\n\nCody Chetty c Rashid Khan b Pollard 12 (18), TSK 58/2 in 8.3 overs\n\nA four off the fourth ball and a four off the sixth. and Conway is away. Bowling the second over is Trent Boult and he will be up against Faf du Plessis. Two proper giants of international cricket across formats.\n\nNatalie Germanos and Sunil Gavaskar were on pitch report duties today: It's pretty warm - 40 degrees Celsius. Same strip that was used yesterday. Even square boundaries, longer hit straight. More wickets have fallen to pace in this tournament but spinners have been consistent. This looks like a very good pitch to bat on, little bit of grass and new ball bowlers will get some help early on.\n\nTSK had to chase down a target of 164 in their last match. That started looking like an impossible task when they were reduced to 78/6 in 14 overs. However, then came an act of rolling back the years from veteran Dwayne Bravo. Bravo smashed 76 off 39 balls in an innings that included five fours and six sixes and almost single-handedly brought Texas to within six runs of the target. He was not dismissed but it was too steep a gradient to climb in the end for TSK.\n\nCricket has joined the Major League planet in the USA that is already occupied by its baseball and football, or soccer, iterations. The former, of course, is on a different planet altogether, a pioneering league that is considered one of the inspirations of the IPL itself. The MLS has done wonders for the sport of football in the country. Now comes the MLC, hoping to do the rather unimaginable task of making cricket as much an American sport as baseball or basketball. If that is to be, then encounters like CSK vs MI in the IPL is sorely needed. Let's see if the MLC versions of these two teams can emulate their success both on and off the field.

    "body": "During umpteenth travels across the Atlantic, Liam Plunkett constantly found himself in a quandary about possibly relocating to the U.S, where his wife Emeleah is from.\n\nAs a professional cricketer, with the pace bowler having represented England from 2005-19, his employment prospects in the sport appeared rather slim in a country where the British bat and ball game is merely a curiosity at best.\n\n\"I started flying back and forth to America after I met my wife 15 years ago,\" Plunkett told me in an interview.\n\n\"As we got more serious, I could see myself living in the U.S. but I didn't know what I'd be doing there. What does that look like?\"\n\nPlunkett's last international game proved his career highpoint having helped England to a momentous World Cup triumph on home soil in mid-2019.\n\nBut it ended on a bitter note as England sought to focus on younger bowlers, with Plunkett blindsided by management's shift in direction as he suddenly found himself pondering his future.\n\n\"Do I stay in County cricket (in the UK) or go into coaching or mentorship?\" he thought at the time.\n\nFortunately, Major League Cricket - a pro T20 franchise league hoped to spur the unfulfilled potential of cricket in the world's biggest sports market - came calling and after numerous setbacks will finally launch on July 13.\n\nThe league's hierarchy has sought particular expertise from veteran players with an American link.\n\n\"I got a phone call from MLC and they said 'listen, we understand your wife's here. Do you want to come on board with Major League Cricket?',\" said Plunkett, who jumped at the opportunity and in 2021 made the move to his new home of Pennsylvania.\n\nPlunkett has been tasked with helping set up MLC and making it \"more professional\", while running cricket academies in Philadelphia.\n\n\"You have kids here in America, under 11s and 13s, who are as good as anywhere in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"The drop off comes at 15 because there hadn't really been that next next pathway here. There's no real sustainable revenue to make a career out of it.\n\n\"We are hoping academies will provide a pipeline for those who are still developing their skills to have more high performance training.\n\n\"Hopefully MLC can show that it's possible to make a living through cricket.\"\n\nPlunkett will be one of the headline players for San Francisco Unicorns, led by former Australia captain Aaron Finch, but the tournament's ultimate success could hinge on emerging national cricketers.\n\nSpinning all-rounder Sanjay Krishnamurthi will be Plunkett's teammate at the Unicorns with the 20-year-old having already played international cricket for the U.S.\n\nArizona-raised Krishnamurthi developed an affinity with cricket from his India-born father, but truly fell in love with the sport when India memorably won the 2011 World Cup on home soil.\n\nJust a few months later, Krishnamurthi and his parents moved to India where his skills developed quickly amid specialist training and intense competition.\n\n\"There are so many players at a high level in India, whereas in the U.S. we have a few really good players but it drops off,\" he told me in an interview.\n\nKrishnamurthi returned to the U.S. seeking greater playing opportunities and represents the type of emerging talent hoped to capture the imagination of local fans.\n\n\"If I can help a few kids pick up the game and fall in love with it like I did...that would be exciting,\" he said.\n\nRealizing that American cricket needs homegrown heroes, like Krishnamurthi, Plunkett has resisted the temptation to play in next year's T20 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S.\n\n\"That was never really my ambition to play,\" he said. \"I feel like players who are younger or who grafted hard deserve to play. U.S. cricket will get better with these youngsters being exposed to professional cricket.\"\n\nPlunkett, however, will soon be lining up for Unicorns in MLC's opening season as they build a brand from scratch in a world famous sports city.\n\nVisibility will be tough initially with the Unicorns still in the midst of developing a cricket stadium in Santa Clara. The inaugural MLC season will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\n\"It will be tricky in the first couple of years for the whole league until every franchise has their stadium,\" he said. \"But there's a lot of cricket that is played in San Francisco, so there is a cricket base.\n\n\"We will need to hit the right market to help it grow. It would be good to get some big athletes involved like Kevin Durant investing in the Philadelphia Union in Major League Soccer.\"\n\nEven before launching, MLC has caused a stir with the tournament to be played in peak summer, a quieter period in the congested American sports scene but clashing with England's cricket season.\n\nThe well-heeled tournament - already boasting funding of over $100 million - has lured opener Jason Roy, who cancelled his England deal to sign a larger contract with MLC.\n\nPlunkett has suddenly found himself torn in the middle, having experienced the exhilaration and pride of representing England across formats, but now resembling a recruiter.\n\n\"People (England cricketers) do reach out to me. I still speak to a lot of the guys. It's piqued the interest that's for sure,\" he said.\n\n\"They want to know how it (MLC) is going. Hopefully there are opportunities for guys to get across and that it can coexist with the England season.\"\n\nIn similar sentiment expressed by MLC's hierarchy, which they hope is a notable point of difference to other leagues, Plunkett believed the glamorous American sports market can lure those reluctant to go on the T20 franchise merry-go-round.\n\n\"It's very exciting for players,\" he said. \"Sports is so big in America, that if we can crack the market then there are other opportunities for players to network and open up streams of revenue in terms of commercially and sponsorship.\"\n\nPressure is on for MLC, which will finally be unleashed after Covid-19 delays and well-worn tumult within American cricket, but there is confidence from within that it can become a harbinger for the sport in coveted terrain.\n\n\"I want people tuning in from the U.K. and Australia to recognize an amazing product, but it feels American as well,\" Plunkett said.\n\n\"If I can be one of the people who spearheaded this and made it grow then that will be a pretty amazing legacy.\"",

    "title": "Cricket's resurgence in the USA: The impact of Major League Cricket",
    "date": "Fri Jul 21 19:59:22 2023",
    "body": "Cricket was the USA's national game once upon a time, and the nation also served as the birthplace of the sport's very first international match. It may sound like an unbelievable story, but the historic encounter between the United States and Canada took place in none other than the city of New York.\n\nIn 1844, an enthusiastic crowd of 10,000 spectators gathered at NYC's Bloomingdale Park to witness this momentous event. Cricket's roots had firmly planted themselves on the American soil, captivating the imaginations of enthusiasts. However, as the years passed, it faded into the background, overshadowed by the rise of other popular sports such as baseball and basketball.\n\nBut now, a new chapter in American cricket is being written as Major League Cricket arrives in the Lone Star State of Texas. The question on everyone's lips is whether this sport, with its rich history, can once again capture the hearts and minds of the American people.\n\nWhile crowds may not immediately pack the stadiums to the rafters, the Major League Cricket is fresh and holds the promise of rekindling the nation's forgotten love for the game. With its strategic location, diverse population, and a renewed interest in embracing different sports, Texas serves as the ideal backdrop for this cricketing revival.\n\nSustainability of Major League Cricket in the USA\n\nAs the bat meets the ball on the American soil once again, Major League Cricket aims to capture the essence of the sport's glory days, injecting it with a fresh and modern twist. By showcasing the skills and talents of international players alongside a crop of promising American cricketing talent, the league seeks to establish a new era of cricketing excellence and fan engagement in the United States.\n\nThe rapid and action-packed T20 cricket format has gained immense popularity through franchise leagues in various countries like Pakistan, Australia, the Caribbean, and England. However, the crown jewel is undoubtedly the Indian Premier League (IPL), which recently emerged as the most-watched digital sports event worldwide.\n\nWith its extravagant success, the IPL has become a multi-million dollar powerhouse. It generates broadcasting fees exceeding $15 million per match and has positioned itself as the second richest league globally, second only to the NFL.\n\nThe IPL owes much of its financial strength to significant investments from American stakeholders such as Silver Lake Partners, TPG Capital, and KKR & Co. This infusion of capital has propelled the league's growth, transforming it into a desirable product to emulate.\n\nThe three-hour matches, packed with colossal sixes, top-tier talent from around the world, captivating on-field entertainment, and cutting-edge technology showcased in impressive stadiums, have contributed to its mass appeal.\n\nNow, Major League Cricket finds itself in a similar position, armed with substantial financial backing. The next steps involve creating a compelling visual experience, establishing state-of-the-art facilities, and building a dedicated fanbase.\n\nThe tournament is a collaborative effort between The Times of India Group, the country's largest media conglomerate, and has garnered substantial initial funding of $120 million (£94m). This impressive financial backing includes prominent figures such as Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft.\n\nIndia and the MLC\n\nCricket's global landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation with a gradual shift towards franchise-based cricket. This could mark a groundbreaking turning point with the introduction of the Indian Premier League's (IPL) franchises into the United States through the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) edition.\n\nThe impact of this development cannot be overstated, as four of the six MLC franchises have already been taken over or received significant investments from IPL giants. Kolkata Knight Riders have set their sights on Los Angeles, Chennai Super Kings are expanding to Texas, Mumbai Indians are making their mark in New York, and Delhi Capitals have found a home in Seattle as the Seattle Orcas.\n\nSuch a move is set to reshape the cricketing ecosystem permanently, attracting new audiences, and enhancing the sport's global appeal. The participation of IPL franchises in MLC brings a wealth of experience, star players, and a passionate fanbase, which is sure to create a thrilling and engaging cricketing spectacle.\n\nEven the remaining two franchises, namely Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns, though not directly affiliated with the IPL, still have strong connections with Indian roots. San Francisco Unicorns boast top investors in Venture Capitalists Venky Hariharan and Anand Rajaraman, who have secured the involvement of Australian state side Victoria, adding an international dimension to their lineup.\n\nSimilarly, Washington Freedom is owned by Indian American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil, who has partnered with the New South Wales state cricket body from Australia. This infusion of diverse backgrounds and expertise will undoubtedly enrich the cricketing experience for players and fans alike.\n\nAnd let's not forget the star power involved. The Seattle franchise's inclusion of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella as one of the investors adds a touch of tech and glamor to the mix, further fueling excitement and interest in the league.\n\nAs cricket enthusiasts eagerly await the kickoff of Major League Cricket with these influential franchises on board, it's clear that the sport's future is set to be more enthralling and diverse than ever before.\n\nThe fusion of Indian cricketing prowess, international partnerships, and high-profile investors is a recipe for success, promising a new era for the sport on a global scale. The world of cricket is in for a thrilling ride as it embraces this bold and exciting evolution.\n\nThe sport's future\n\nCricket has been played in the United States for many years, but it has traditionally been a niche sport with a relatively small following, compared to those like baseball, American football, basketball, and soccer. Major League Cricket (MLC) is a professional cricket league that aims to promote and popularize the sport in the United States.\n\nMajor League Cricket's success and popularity will depend on several factors. These include its efforts to market and promote the sport effectively, the quality of play and competition, the accessibility of cricket facilities, and the level of interest among the American population.\n\nCricket faces significant challenges in breaking into the mainstream sports market in the United States due to the dominance of other established sports. However, there has been some growth in its popularity in recent years. This is driven by an increase in immigrant populations from cricket-playing countries and the efforts to develop cricket infrastructure and grassroots programs.\n\nIf Major League Cricket can capitalize on these trends, generate a strong fanbase, secure media coverage, and attract talented players, it could have a chance of gaining popularity in America. However, it will likely take time and sustained efforts to establish itself as a major sport in the country.\n\nUltimately, Major League Cricket's future popularity in America will depend on its ability and stakeholders to overcome the challenges and generate widespread interest and support for the sport.\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) has the potential to revolutionize cricket in the United States. With its ambitious plans to establish a professional league and promote the game at the grassroots level, MLC aims to introduce cricket to a wider audience and create a thriving cricket culture in the country.\n\nThe league's focus on engaging local communities, developing young talent, and fostering international collaborations demonstrates its commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.\n\nAs MLC gains momentum and attracts top players from around the world, it has the opportunity to establish itself as a prominent cricket league on the global stage. With its innovative approach and unwavering passion for the game, Major League Cricket is poised to make a significant impact and reshape the cricket landscape in the United States.",

    "title": "Can cricket crack America? New T20 league aims to take US by storm",
    "date": "Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "For decades, cricket’s powers have dreamed of making it big in America. Starting on Thursday the grandest, richest attempt yet to get Americans hooked on cricket will begin in a converted baseball stadium (capacity: 7,200) on the outskirts of Dallas. Major League Cricket, as the new competition is known, has money: close to $50m already spent, with another $130m on the way. It has wealthy patrons: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella leads a roll call of leading Indian-American tech executives who’ve signed up to throw cash at the new venture. It has the blessing of an International Cricket Council desperate to lift its sport’s profile in America ahead of the 2024 T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies. It has powerful allies: four Indian Premier League franchises and two state cricket bodies from Australia have signed on as either full owners or operational partners for the fledgling league’s six founding teams. It has a slot in the international cricket calendar that’s relatively uncrowded, with only the men’s and women’s Ashes as real competition for the committed global cricket fan’s attention. It has a list of team names that combine, in delightfully unbound American style, the patriotic (Washington Freedom) and ecological (Seattle Orcas) with the borrowed-from-the-IPL nonsensical (MI New York).\n\nMost importantly it has players, and some extremely capable ones at that: sprinkled among the little-known local talents (Corne Dry, anyone?) the new competition features the genuine stardust of Wanindu Hasaranga, Kagiso Rabada, Tim David and Anrich Nortje, among many other established T20 internationals who’ve made the trek out to the suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex to help launch cricket’s latest big shot at success in America. But will Major League Cricket have any viewers? Will the American public thrill to the spectacle of a beefy heave through midwicket from Aaron Finch? Will it learn to lament, as millions of cricket fans throughout the world already do, the lost opportunities of a wasted PowerPlay? Will it grow to appreciate the finer points of an Adam Zampa strangler down leg side, or a topless cameo from Faf du Plessis on the player balcony? The final touches – the marking of the boundary barrier, the laying of the turf wicket, the engineering of the outfield – have just been applied to convert the former home ground of now-defunct off-brand baseball side the Texas AirHogs into an international-grade cricket venue. The dream is in place, the field has been built. But will they come?\n\nThe history of the flatter-batted of the bat and ball sports in the United States provides some basis for caution. Vying with baseball for local supremacy in the late 19th century, cricket enjoyed a brief American “golden age” thanks to the exertions of the Philadelphia Cricket Club, once seen as the equal of the best international teams. But Britain’s late-imperial insecurity saw the US frozen out of international competition, and American cricket went into a rapid and seemingly irreversible decline in the years following the first world war. Since the turn of this century there have been several failed attempts to launch a professional domestic cricket league: Pro Cricket, a prototype of T20 cricket, played a single season in 2004 before folding, while the original ‘Major League Cricket’, launched in 2005 with the patronage of West Indian greats Clive Lloyd and Desmond Haynes, quickly fizzled into insignificance. Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar hosted a series of exhibition matches across the US in 2015 that got expats and immigrants of South Asian, Caribbean and Australian backgrounds excited but no one else. How many times can a sport this old to America be rebranded as something exotic and new? Compounding the inauspiciousness of this history are the troubles facing USA Cricket. The administration and finances of cricket’s governing body in America are a mess, continuing a long history of mismanagement of the sport in this country; the previous governing body was expelled by the ICC in 2017. USA Cricket will have no permanent CEO in place when Major League Cricket launches on Thursday night.\n\nMLC’s organizers recognize that the road ahead presents some obstacles: “We are somewhat concerned by and appreciative of USA Cricket’s struggles,” says Sameer Mehta, one of the league’s co-CEOs. But he and his fellow founder, Vijay Srinivasan, are thinking big. Mehta and Srinivasan launched Willow TV, the primary streaming app for cricket in the US, in the early 2000s, before selling it to The Times Group, India’s biggest media conglomerate, in 2016. With the money and connections from that sale they have created Major League Cricket, and they believe the time is finally right for America to fully embrace the flat-batted sport. Partly this is because of the recent “cosmopolitan turn” among American sports fans, who are now just as likely to tune in to the late laps from Monza (the Drive to Survive effect, let’s call it) or Brentford v West Ham as they are to enjoy local pro sports. Mostly, though, it’s a function of the growing economic clout and cultural self-confidence of America’s Indian population – almost five million strong, fantastically wealthy (at $140,000, Indian Americans have the highest per capita household wealth of any ethnic group in the US), and growing rapidly thanks to Silicon Valley’s inexhaustible thirst for South Asian tech talent. “It’s insane how successful this community has become so quickly in the last couple of decades,” says Mehta. “But they haven’t brought their culture with them. It’s only very recently that they are flexing their muscles.” Major League Cricket looms as the Indian American community’s next big flex.\n\nCan a sport with serious financial backing and an existing fan base among America’s ex-Commonwealth migrant population strike gold in the land of the free? Can the transmitted enthusiasm of the Australian flat white makers of Brooklyn help unleash cricket fever across all 50 states? At times it can feel difficult to imagine how this experiment might succeed. Talking to Americans about cricket is usually about as easy as explaining climate change to a ferret. But for MLC, a template of sorts exists. From its “anchor” fan base among the country’s Hispanic migrant population, Major League Soccer has expanded at such a rate over the past two decades that the round ball game now outranks hockey on most metrics as America’s fourth most popular sport. Cricket is arguably a tougher sell to the American public than soccer: it’s played by fewer countries at elite level, and the sport’s global profusion of formats and competitions means cricket lacks some of the clarity of football’s cultural hierarchy, under which Europe’s top domestic leagues are unanimously considered the pinnacle of competition. But if any “foreign” sport is going to break through and make it in America, why not this one?\n\nMLC’s backers think they have the goods to win over the American heartland. Mehta insists the league is not a play to win Indian viewership but a direct gamble on the sport’s potential appeal to Americans; each of the founding franchises has committed to building a stadium in its home city so the league can evolve as a proper home-and-away competition in the years to come. The league is making all the right noises about professional “pathways” for domestic cricketers, developing local talent, and so on. Teams are required to fit a minimum of nine local players under the squad salary cap of $1.15m; up to nine overseas players can be selected but a maximum of six are allowed in each starting XI. Games for the inaugural tournament have been scheduled mostly at night to cater to US viewers, rather than during hours more suitable to the TV audience in India. “Americans don’t like to be lectured about a sport that’s being played elsewhere,” says Mehta. “But if the sport’s being played in their country right next to them, they are absolute sports fanatics, and they will sample anything and everything. Our view is that T20 is an amazing sport for US consumption and for US audiences. It fits in with what Americans like to consume: it’s three hours long, there’s lots of action, it has some similarities with baseball but then has a lot of compelling differences also.”\n\nThe format of the inaugural tournament is straightforward: the six teams will play each other once, and the top four sides will contest three qualification and elimination games before the final is held on 30 July. Three of the group games will be played at a 3,000-capacity ground in North Carolina; the rest will take place at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. Major League Cricket is promising a 30-camera, world class broadcast production at both venues for the games, which will be shown live on Willow TV, with a mainstream broadcast partner set to be announced before the opening fixture. In future years, Mehta hopes, the league will expand to 10 teams with a longer season.\n\nThe teams for the inaugural season seem genuinely competitive and evenly matched, with the possible exception of the Seattle Orcas, who are likely to depend very heavily on the fluctuating powers of Quinton de Kock. The San Francisco Unicorns sport incredible hitting strength (Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade), while Washington Freedom have perhaps the league’s most balanced squad, boasting pace (Nortje, Marco Jansen), middle-order power (Josh Philippe, Moises Henriques), and world cricket’s best T20 all-rounder (Hasaranga). The Los Angeles Knight Riders mix T20 A-listers (Adam Zampa, Jason Roy), veterans (Martin Guptill), exuberantly named locals (Shadley van Schalkwyk), and mercurial post-international mercenaries capable of devastating displays of power hitting (Andre Russell, Rilee Roussow) in a proportion that already feels, despite the league’s immaturity, canonical.\n\nThe Texas Super Kings, meanwhile, are very dependent on du Plessis and an aging Dwayne Bravo, but they also boast dual-passport Australian-American “local” Cameron Stevenson, who’s the only player in the tournament to have his profile photo featured on both the official MLC website and the “about” page of a Melbourne-based civil engineering firm. Stevenson played professional cricket for Tasmania for two years until 2018 and now works as an engineer for the firm that reshaped Grand Prairie Stadium into a cricket ground; he qualifies as a local for MLC purposes thanks to his American mother. It’s curiosities like this that give MLC its special charm, but the magic is not confined solely to the league’s less heralded names. Celebrated ex-players want their part of history: Stephen Fleming, Lasith Malinga, and Shane Watson are all involved in MLC as coaches. MI New York boast an outstanding bowling attack that includes Rabada, Trent Boult and Jason Behrendorff, but its crowning glory is Rashid Khan, captain of Afghanistan and the world’s top ranked T20 bowler. More than two decades on from the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, Major League Cricket presents the tantalizing prospect of a genuine Afghan superstar – a man who grew up in the kiln of the US occupation and whose family was forced into exile for several years during the worst of the violence – exhibiting his wrist-spinning artistry on an American field of play. Despite the sport’s long history in the US, cricket’s latest assault on America feels somehow novel, like the stage for a fresh encounter between two parts of the world that have rarely understood each other in anything other than antagonistic terms.",

    "date": "Thu Nov 17 10:18:48 2022",
    "body": "This news came from The Stadium Business at this link.\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC), the new Twenty20 competition which aims to boost the sport’s presence in the United States, has set July 13, 2023, as its launch date, while outlining further details concerning its venue development plans.\n\nMLC’s opening match will take place at the newly-constructed Grand Prairie Stadium, in Grand Prairie, Texas. The 2023 season will feature 19 matches to be played over 18 days, building up to the first-ever MLC championship final on July 30.\n\nSix teams from major metropolitan areas – representing Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Seattle and New York City – will each have multiple global stars on their rosters alongside the best talent based in the US.\n\n“Next summer, the eyes of world cricket will be on the launch of Major League Cricket, with the stars of the game competing over three weeks of fast-paced T20 action,” said Justin Geale, MLC tournament director.\n\n“The launch of MLC will transform American cricket and provide one of the best platforms in the sport for the world’s most elite players to showcase their skills while also fast-tracking the development of domestic talent to feature in the league.”\n\nA special ceremony at Grand Prairie Stadium yesterday (Tuesday) marked the installation of the 7,200-capacity venue’s playing pitch, with construction set to be complete in spring 2023. Grand Prairie Stadium, in the works since November 2020 and located in the heart of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, will be the competition’s primary venue for the 2023 season and home venue for Dallas’ MLC team.\n\n“Grand Prairie Stadium will be the best cricket venue in the United States upon its completion,” said Ron Jensen, Mayor of Grand Prairie. “This venue will be a huge asset to the Grand Prairie community, bringing Major League Cricket, international cricket and potentially the 2024 ICC T20 Men’s World Cup to Grand Prairie allowing fans here to experience a world class sport in action.”\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium, the former home of the Texas AirHogs American Association of Independent Professional Baseball team, is being converted to a cricket-specific facility at a cost of $20m (£16.9m/€19.3m) with the addition of seats around the oval increasing permanent capacity to 7,200.\n\nThe venue will feature 1,000 club and premium seats, with the ability to expand to a capacity of over 15,000 for major events. It is expected to host matches at the T20 World Cup in 2024, set to be co-hosted by the United States and the West Indies.\n\nWork was originally due to be complete earlier this year, but has seen delays that have also resulted in the launch of MLC’s first season being postponed by more than a year.\n\nA host of other US cricket venues are being planned, but ESPNcricinfo reports that slow progress on these could see Grand Prairie Stadium serve as the sole host for MLC’s debut season.\n\nMLC in May completed an initial $44m Series A and A1 fundraising round, with an additional commitment of $76m in further fundraising guaranteed over the next 12 months to support the development of stadiums and training centres across the US.",
    "summary": "**Launch Date:** The MLC tournament is set to launch on July 13, 2023.\n\n**Opening Match:** The opening match will take place at the newly-constructed Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\n**Season Details:** The 2023 season will feature 19 matches played over 18 days, culminating in the first-ever MLC championship final on July 30.\n\n**Teams:** Six teams will participate, representing major metropolitan areas: Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Seattle, and New York City. Each team will have multiple global stars and the best US-based talent.\n\n**Venue:** Grand Prairie Stadium, with a seating capacity of 7,200, will be the primary venue for the 2023 season and home to the Dallas MLC team. The stadium is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in spring 2023.\n\n**Future Plans:** Several other US cricket venues are planned, but slow progress may result in Grand Prairie Stadium being the sole host for MLC's debut season. The MLC has secured significant funding to support the development of stadiums and training centers across the US.",

    "date": "Mon Jul 10 16:00:50 2023",
    "body": "Baseball may be America’s national pastime, but globally its popularity doesn’t come close to cricket. The other—and much older—game with bats and balls has origins dating back to the 16th century, and estimates put its fanbase at more than 2.5 billion people, second only to soccer. Major League Cricket debuts July 13 in Dallas, er, Grand Prairie technically. With this newly formed US pro league, fans in North Texas and around the country will have a chance to cheer on local teams in person.\n\nThe new league features six teams, including the Texas Super Kings, which will play its games in Grand Prairie. Other teams are based in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington DC.\n\n“The Dallas area has one of the largest groups of cricket fans in the country, with hundreds of thousands of expats from countries such as India and Pakistan in the area who love the game,” says Tom Dumore, VP of Marketing for Major League Cricket.\n\nAll matches take on the Twenty20 (or “T20”) format, which is a shortened version of the traditional game that was introduced professionally about two decades ago.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\n“Cricket dates back to the 16th century, and sometimes the perception of it in the general population in the US is that it’s a stuffy game for British men in top hats, but nothing could be further from the truth,” says Dunmore. The T20 format, especially, is known for its fast-paced play, big hits, music, and fireworks. Matches clock in around two and a half hours, and the ball’s in play a lot more than in baseball, where abundant strikeouts can keep fans waiting multiple innings for action. For more on the rules, check out this helpful explainer from Vox.\n\nEarlier this year, MLC hosted a draft that allowed each team to select nine domestic players—most plucked from the Minor League Cricket circuit—and round out their rosters with international signings. Captain Faf du Plessis hails from South Africa and has enjoyed a successful career there as well as in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nThe Super Kings are coached by Stephen Fleming, a former captain of New Zealand’s national cricket team and the current head coach of IPL team the Chennai Super Kings. That’s not just a coincidence. The Texas team is co-owned by the Chennai Super Kings along with Ross Perot Jr. and businessman Anurag Jain.\n\nThe inaugural season is more like a tournament, with 19 matches played July 13 through July 30, when the championship takes place in Grand Prairie. Dunmore explains that next year is likely to enlist a similar format, especially as the T20 Men’s Cricket World Cup will also host games in the US. But as the league grows and stadiums are built in the home cities for each team, we can expect the season to expand in length and matches to occur in more markets.\n\nThe Super Kings have taken over the old AirHogs baseball stadium in Grand Prairie, renovating the space to accommodate 7,000 fans and a professional cricket pitch. The majority of games will be played in Grand Prairie this season, with additional games held at a dedicated cricket pitch in Morrisville, North Carolina, outside of Raleigh.\n\nThe first match is Thursday, July 13, when the Texas Super Kings take on the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nIf you can’t attend in person, no worries, matches will also be available to watch on TV. Live matches will be shown on Willow TV, a dedicated cricket channel, and available to stream on Sling TV.\n\n“There’s a reason the IPL now rivals the NFL and the English Premier League for media rights revenue,” adds Dunmore. “It’s a fantastic experience to watch live on TV or in person.”",

    "date": "Thu Jul 20 12:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Although cricket, a sport loved by billions of fans worldwide, has historically been slow to take hold in the United States, the current T20 tournament format offers a fresh opportunity to give the sport a foothold in the lucrative American market. T20 cricket, with games that can be completed in an evening (as opposed to five days for Test cricket and a full day for One-Day cricket) and its focus on fan entertainment, promises to provide a faster-paced, more engaging version of the traditional game. What’s more, with prominent international players taking part in the MLC tournament and games streamed live around the world, the league stands to get the benefit of a sizable international viewing base and multinational sponsors, giving it some runway to establish a dedicated American fan base.\n\nFor sponsors, the launch of MLC offers unique sponsorship and promotional opportunities and the potential ability to connect and engage with new audiences. Given cricket’s established international fan base in lucrative emerging markets such as India, US brands may view MLC as a new medium through which they can penetrate otherwise difficult-to-reach international markets and customers. In addition, the buzz of a new league in the US and the international star power present during the inaugural season may lead international brands to view MLC as a new opportunity to expand their reach in the US and engage with US consumers.\n\nThe excitement of the inaugural MLC season and the attention given to MLC also presents potentially lucrative opportunities for MLC and MLC teams and venues to monetize their investment by securing both short-term sponsorship opportunities with brands looking to capitalize on the current excitement and long-term partnerships with sponsors looking to “get in on the ground floor” of MLC and professional cricket in the US as a partner with the sport for years to come.\n\nThere are numerous risks and considerations that need to be taken into account with any sponsorship or promotional arrangement. Several notable examples include the scope of the sponsorship “category,” category exclusivity (if any), effect of force majeure events and work stoppages, allocation of costs, intellectual property protection, league rules, media rights and broadcast issues, and a whole host of other complex legal and business issues. Both the sponsors, on one hand, and the MLC and MLC teams and venues on the other, will need to create, negotiate, finalize, and activate sponsorship and promotional arrangements which are mutually beneficial for each party, which will likely model the arrangements used in the context of other professional sports leagues, but with modifications to reflect certain unique aspects inherent in the sport of cricket.\n\nArentFox Schiff’s Sports Practice Group boasts one of the most experienced and diverse sports practices in the country and regularly advises sports organizations (including leagues, conferences, teams, and national governing bodies), players, sponsors, and investors on a broad variety of sports matters, including numerous high-profile naming rights and sponsorship transactions.",

    "title": "3 reasons why Texas Super Kings are favourites to win the inaugural Major League Cricket season",
    "date": "Wed Jul 12 00:33:07 2023",
    "body": "The inaugural edition of the Major League Cricket tournament will kick off on July 14 and the event will run for more than two weeks, with the Final slated for July 31. The six teams that will compete for the trophy are: Texas Super Kings, Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, and Washington Freedom.\n\nThe leaders of the six teams are: Faf du Plessis (TSK), Sunil Narine (LAKR), Kieron Pollard (MINY), Aaron Finch (SFU), Moises Henriques (WF), and Wayne Parnell (SO).\n\nWhile all the six sides are quite balanced, the Texas Super Kings, led by the experienced Faf du Plessis, look like the team to beat in the MLC.\n\nHere, we look at three reasons why the Texas Super Kings are the favourites to win the inaugural season of the MLC:\n\n#1 Highly experienced squad\n\nThe Texas Super Kings have a bunch of players who are very experienced. The likes of David Miller, Faf du Plessis, Dwayne Bravo, Mitchell Santner, Daniel Sams, Devon Conway, and Rusty Theron have been around the circuit for a while now.\n\nMiller has played 446 T20s, du Plessis 343, Bravo 558, Santner 168, Sams 138, Conway 156, while Theron has featured in 129 games in the shortest format.\n\nMoreover, all of them have been a part of the Indian Premier League at some point or the other and that is an important point. Their experience will be a priceless asset as the Super Kings franchise looks to taste success in the first season of Major League Cricket.\n\n#2 Captaincy\n\nIn Faf du Plessis, the Texas Super Kings have a skipper who leads through his actions. Faf is easily one of the best players in the world even though he is at the wrong end of his 30s. He recently enjoyed a great run in the IPL, having fallen just short of winning the Orange Cap.\n\nHe was the captain of the Royal Challengers Bangalore and even though the side failed to make the playoffs, Faf's tactical smarts were extremely impressive.\n\nHe has led quite a few other teams, including his national side in the past, which will hold him in good stead in the MLC. To add to it, his calmness and level-headed nature is something that will rub on his teammates and help the team as a whole.\n\n#3 World-class death bowlers\n\nTSK have a set of death bowlers who are not only experienced but have a reputation of executing yorkers well more often than not. Gerald Coetzee is one of the most impressive prodigies going around at the moment and his form coming into the MLC has been impressive. That he was overlooked by the IPL teams was a massive shock for fans and pundits.\n\nDaniel Sams has a brilliant record in the death overs and has emerged as a wicket-taking option for all the teams that he plays for. He is currently a crucial member of Kent in the T20 Blast in which he has got the better of some of the best power hitters going around.\n\nThen, there is Dwayne Bravo who needs no introduction. He has been integral to the franchise's success in the IPL and the owners will hope for him to deliver in America as well. Rusty Theron just adds to their stocks. Therefore, they will be one of the most feared bowling line-ups in the tournament.",

The team has a highly experienced squad, with players like David Miller, Dwayne Bravo, Mitchell Santner, Daniel Sams, Devon Conway, and Rusty Theron, who have played numerous T20s and have IPL experience.\n\t2. Faf du Plessis is an experienced captain who leads by example and has a calm and level-headed nature that will benefit the team.\n\t3.

The league takes place in the gap between the T20 Blast (barring Finals Day) and the Hundred, clashing with two rounds of County Championship fixtures and the final two Ashes Tests.\n\nRelated\n\nSunil Narine pulls out of Finals Day with Surrey to focus on Major League Cricket\n\nCricket's American dream takes flight - 'This season is about proving we can do it'\n\nSteven Smith in contention for Major League Cricket action in 2024\n\nSunil Narine's mission impossible: 75 hours, two continents, four games\n\nMLC: Teams, players, format, fixtures, and everything else you need to know\n\nThe ECB told centrally contracted players that they would not be given no-objection certificates (NOCs) to play that MLC and Roy requested a release from his incremental contract in order to take up his deal with Los Angeles Knight Riders, an affiliate of his IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\n\"We'd probably like a couple more of the [England] guys, to be honest,\" Justin Geale, MLC's tournament director, told ESPNcricinfo. \"But there are enough players to go around and we're certainly not here to start a war with anyone.\n\n\"It'd probably be a big ask for the red-ball, centrally contracted players but I think for some of the white-ball guys, there's a world where they come over for sure. It's not a huge tournament. We've certainly had an awful lot of interest from English players and we've had some positive engagement with them.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's what is good for the players as well. If they can supplement incomes while playing good cricket that is relevant for their careers, boards are generally okay with it. I couldn't speak on behalf of the ECB but I certainly don't think there's any animosity between us, or any 'we won't be releasing players, leave us alone' type thing.\"\n\nMoeen Ali confirmed last month that he has an offer - understood to be with Texas Super Kings - to play in MLC in 2024, and England do not have any white-ball internationals scheduled between the end of the men's T20 World Cup in June and their home series against Australia in September.\n\nMLC's launch has already had a direct impact on the Hundred, the ECB's 100-ball competition which is heading into its third season. While the leagues do not clash - the Hundred starts on August 1, two days after MLC's final - several overseas players pulled out of the Hundred draft after signing deals to play in the USA.\n\n\"There's a genuine curiosity about coming here, and it's not a bad place to come and tour, the US: they can bring their family or their golf clubs and stay on for a bit, so we haven't struggled there. The interest from players has been really good and there are some pretty star-studded line-ups\"\n\nJustin Geale, MLC's tournament director\n\nHigher salaries and the pull of IPL-affiliated teams mean the standard of overseas players in MLC is clearly higher, and with MLC expected to expand next year, the Hundred is clearly under threat. But Geale insisted, \"We're not here to compete with anyone.\"\n\nHe added, \"Players are really keen to come and have a look.

    "body": "If you have ever thought about the sports industry, here is why what MLC is doing is a big deal!\n\nCricket is the 2nd most popular sport in the world. There are several cricket players that boast 2x the following of basketball legends like Michael Jordan. Yet the USA hasn’t historically been too keen on cricket.\n\nThe F1 Netflix Show \"Drive to Survive\" is a clear example of how growing your sport in the most consuming country in the world is a huge advantage. It brings more money, more eyeballs, more ad revenue and makes the sport more geographically diverse!\n\nKnowing all this, MLC attempted to do a proof of concept to show how to bring cricket to the USA!\n\nMLC got 3 of the biggest Indian cricket franchises to outright manage some of the teams to grow their own cricket expertise. As a segue, The Indian franchise cricket league has grown to the largest one in cricket and second richest league in any sport in the world, with each team having a valuation of over 1B dollars and the league raking in 19M $ per game.\n\nMLC allows 5 world-class international players per team to join the league and it was incredible to see them all travel and play in the Texas heat. They got world-class broadcasters and commentators for the matches too.\n\nIn mere 3 weeks they retro-fitted a baseball stadium into a cricket stadium in Dallas and had several games (including opening night) that were sold out with ~6000 fans! While there is more that needs to be done at the stadium it is commendable how quickly they made it!\n\nAs a semi-pro sportsman, it is wonderful to see sports working strategically to grow themselves and operate like tech companies! I am looking forward to seeing how MLC grows the sport, fan base and playing facilities in the USA",

    "body": "The arrival of Major League Cricket — the USA's first-ever professional T20 franchise cricket league — will open up new avenues for the sport, and its fans, in North America.\n\nSanctioned by USA Cricket — the official governing body for cricket in the US — the creation of a professional league for what is still considered to be a niche sport should accelerate the mainstream popularity of cricket throughout the region. At least that is the organizers' plan.\n\nThe sport actually already has something of a tradition in North America. Some might think that the oldest cricket rivalry is between England and Australia. However, that isn't actually the case. According to Tom Melville's 'A History of Cricket in America', before the Civil War, cricket was actually the most famous sport in the country.\n\nAn international contest took place in 1844 between USA and Canada and is known to be one of the earliest cricketing rivalries.\n\nMore than 175 years on, for a large chunk of the American population the sport of cricket is a puzzling question mark. Some people associate it with baseball, while others believe that the game is not fast enough to engage their interest. But what exactly is cricket and how is it played?\n\nHow does cricket work? Rules, format and everything to know\n\nEssentially, cricket is an often tense cat-and-mouse game between two teams of 11 players. The sport can be played in three formats: T20s, One-Day Internationals and Test matches.\n\nMajor League Cricket will be played in the T20 format, a variation that typically lasts for three to four hours.\n\nThe team batting first wants to score as many runs as possible by running between the stumps at each end of the pitch, or by hitting the ball hard — hard enough to fly over the fielders and beyond a rope at the boundary, to earn that team four runs (for crossing the boundary having bounced) or six runs (for crossing the boundary on the fly).\n\nA cricket pitch is the central rectangular strip between the wickets that is 22 yards long and 10 feet wide. And wickets are the three stumps placed at both ends of the pitch.\n\nThe aim of the game is to put a mammoth total on the scoreboard that will prove insurmountable for the opposition. Meanwhile, the bowling team is looking to keep the run total down by getting the batting team's batters out of the field as quickly as possible — either by hitting the wickets, catching the ball when it's been hit by a batter, or forcing the batter to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps directly by using their protective leg pads, rather than their bat (known as Leg Before Wicket, or LBW).\n\nIn T20s, like the MLC, each bowler gets four overs, and one over consists of six balls. Once all the balls have been bowled, or all the batters are out, the teams switch roles.\n\nOne-Day Internationals are similar, but each team has 50 overs, rather than 20, while Test matches are the longest format of the game and take place over five days, with both teams batting twice over two innings and their run total from both being combined.\n\nFrustratingly for some neutrals, Test matches can be played for five days and still end in a draw if one team has not won in that time!\n\nMORE: MLC 2023 results and matches\n\nMajor League Cricket format, rules and schedule\n\nWhile the way that cricket is played across the world is broadly the same, each specific competition can have slight variations on rules relating to rosters and the like.\n\nIn MLC, every team can have a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 19 players on its squad. Each roster will need to have one domestic Under-23 rookie player, to help promote cricket in the USA and develop future generations of American players.\n\nOn its complete roster, each team may have nine international players. However, no more than six of those players will be allowed in the playing 11.\n\nIn MLC, each team will play in the round-robin format against one another. The four teams that emerge on top of the points table will then qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe playoffs will include the Eliminator, the Challenger, the Qualifier and the Final. That Final will be played between the winner of the Qualifier and the Challenger on July 30.\n\nMajor League Cricket playoff schedule\n\nLots to take in? Don’t worry, MLC has got you covered.\n\nSpectators at the stadiums unaware of the rules will receive 'Cricket 101' flyers and get access to ambassadors who will help them understand the game, with the action taking place at the Grand Prairie stadium in Texas and Church Street Park in North Carolina from July 13-30.",

He’d been a star on the New Zealand national cricket team ever since he’d set a world record for the fastest player to score 100 runs—a “century,” in cricket parlance—in a one-day match at just 21 years old. He’d spent the better part of a decade as a globe-trotting superstar, a hulking 6-foot-1, with the blond stubble and effortlessly tousled hair to pass for the Hemsworth brothers’ Kiwi cousin. He’d grown accustomed to being cheered on by tens of thousands from Mumbai to Barbados and, at his peak, pocketing more than half a million dollars for two months of work in the Indian Premier League, the world’s biggest and most lucrative franchised cricket competition.\n\nThen, just days before worldwide air traffic was grounded, Anderson flew from Auckland to Dallas, where his live-in American fiancée, Mary Margaret, was already visiting her mother in Highland Park. For the next nine months, he’d be cooped up in the guest room of his future mother-in-law’s house, acclimating to a life away from the game, stranded in a place where, he says, “cricket’s basically irrelevant for 99 percent of the country.”\n\nA part of him had been preparing for such a transition ever since he got serious with Mary Margaret, whom he’d met at a party four years earlier while on vacation in Croatia. During their courtship, he’d visited Dallas often enough to imagine a life for himself here, growing so fond of the city—the flat terrain, friendly people, and tree-lined streets reminded him of his hometown of Christchurch—that it came to feel like “home away from home.” But that was supposed to be well into the future, after his playing days ended. He’d turned 30 only a few months earlier; he imagined five, maybe six, more years of top-class cricket in front of him. And there was none of that to be found in Dallas—or anywhere else in the United States.\n\n“I knew in my head that I was going to move here at some point in time,” he says. “It just wasn’t yet.”\n\nIn the meantime, though, the borders were closed. He was stuck, with nowhere to play. So he may as well be of use. About six weeks after arriving in Dallas, he tracked down the phone number of Iain Higgins, then the chief executive of USA Cricket, and asked him two questions: what is the state of American cricket, and is there a way he could help?\n\nThe answer to the latter question, as it turned out, was he could. For 90 minutes, Higgins laid out a plan that, if successful, would change professional sports. As cricket surged to become the world’s second-most popular sport, the United States remained by far the largest market it had yet to penetrate, though not for lack of trying. In 2004, a domestic league called Pro Cricket lasted all of a season. A half-decade later, the American Premiere League was announced. It would take a dozen years, and the collapse of the governing body that sanctioned it, for any games to be played, at a far smaller scale than envisioned. But the national interest is there. Peter Della Penna, who covers the sport for ESPN’s English-language cricket site, says that the United States is neck and neck with the United Kingdom as the country providing the most web traffic, behind India. The domestic club scene is growing, too. One-off tournaments dot the country. But no one had ever blended fiscal might with the necessary cricket smarts to build a competition on par with the biggest franchised leagues in India, Pakistan, England, Australia, and the Caribbean.\n\nUntil now. Higgins told Anderson about an investment supergroup called American Cricket Enterprises, which had formed to create Major League Cricket, a six-team professional league that intended to succeed where everyone else had failed in the States. Four of the teams are backed by Indian Premier League clubs, who transformed cricket from stuffy to spectacle at a level unmatched by anyone else. Games would be played in July, a dead spot on the global cricket schedule, as well as the most wide-open time of year on the American sports calendar. There would be world-class stadiums, youth academies, and an accompanying minor league.\n\nAnd, oh, there was money—$120 million to be exact, after $44 million raised from Series A and A1 rounds plus $76 million in additional investment from the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who co-owns Major League Cricket’s Seattle Orcas, and Ross Perot Jr. and Anurag Jain, who are part of the ownership group of Texas Super Kings, the North Texas franchise. More than enough to lure premium talent across the Atlantic for a few weeks per year or persuade them to relocate full time in hopes of establishing a cricket culture that would help elevate the United States into a powerhouse. Do this right, and one day Major League Cricket could bully its way into the top handful of leagues in the world.\n\nThat is where Anderson came in. The following night, Major League Cricket co-founder Sameer Mehta delivered a proposal. What if Anderson accelerated his plan to relocate to the United States? Doing so would come at considerable cost. It would mean renouncing his eligibility for the New Zealand national team and changing residency to the United States, a three-year process that limited the number of days he could leave the country. Anderson’s earning potential would be slashed, too, at least as long as he had no international matches to play and a smaller window to compete in franchised competitions across the globe. He’d face long odds to compete on stages smaller than the ones he’d already graced.\n\nBut saying yes would give him a chance to matter in a way he never could as a cricketer alone. Anderson’s record for the fastest century had fallen a year after he’d set it. He would soon be replaced on the New Zealand team. “But if this can turn into what I think it could turn into, the legacy you create is way bigger,” he says. “Leaving a footprint on the game of cricket [instead of] just being a player who played the game and left the game.”\n\nBest of all, Anderson was already right where he needed to be. While Major League Cricket teams will eventually play in their home cities, which also include New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., only North Texas has a stadium that would be competition-ready out of the gate. For at least the first two years, the bulk of Major League Cricket matches will be played out of the newly renamed Grand Prairie Stadium. (A portion of this year’s games will also be played in Raleigh.) So, too, will a handful of matches in the 2024 T20 World Cup, which the United States will co-host with the West Indies. Perhaps even a match or two in the 2028 Olympics, which is considering adding cricket as a sport. Major League Cricket plans to install its headquarters in Grand Prairie Stadium, where its Australian physical performance coach, Burt Cockley, already resides with the intention of working out of the high-performance center scheduled to be completed next year. Players, drawn to the cheaper cost of living, plus being at the new hub of American cricket, are following. Setting down roots in Dallas would not only amount to a ticket home for Mary Margaret, who had moved to Auckland almost three years earlier, but it would also place Anderson at the epicenter of the most audacious American sports experiment since Major League Soccer was formed in 1993.\n\nSo Anderson signed on—and once he did, says Cockley, “it kind of showed this thing was real.” Now, three years later, Anderson will take the field as part of the San Francisco Unicorns, who selected him fourth in the league’s inaugural domestic player draft. In August, he’ll again captain the Dallas Mustangs, one of 26 teams in Minor League Cricket. He has become one of the league’s brightest faces and trusted ambassadors, and he remains steadfast in his optimism. As Anderson recalls telling Liam Plunkett, an ex-England international he helped recruit to the league, “This is kind of like being part of a startup. Do you want to get in now? Or would you want to wait three or four years and then go, ‘Damn, this thing took off. I’m now joining a bigger crowd to try and kind of find my way’? ”\n\nBut startups bust far more than they boom, and that’s especially true for startup professional sports leagues. Generations of suits have tried and failed to establish lucrative counterprogramming to Major League Baseball, from arena football to rugby. And none of them faced a challenge quite like Major League Cricket’s: to yank a sport buried in the American subculture into the mainstream, while it also attempts to reorganize how the game is played at the grassroots level.\n\nAll the necessary capital—financial, intellectual, athletic—is in place, which only heightens the urgency. Never before has this level of investment been poured into American cricket, which might make Major League Cricket the last, best chance for the sport to hit it big in the United States.\n\n“If this doesn’t work, it won’t work,” Cockley says.\n\nNorth Texas will be the proving ground.\n\nCricket is coming to North Texas​ for all the reasons you might guess. The centrally convenient location. The top-five media market. The thriving sports scene. Even the demographics. Della Penna characterizes cricket in America as “99.9 percent” Southeast Asian or West Indian expats; regional populations have ticked upward since the dot-com boom and surged over the last decade.\n\nBut Major League Cricket planted its flag here for one reason above all others: there was an empty shell for it to crawl into, to call home until it could, hopefully, someday, outgrow it. Consider Major League Cricket a sports-league hermit crab.\n\nAirHogs Stadium, across the road from Lone Star Park, has been vacant for three years. The independent-league baseball team it was named after played there from 2008 through 2020, but, toward the end, they were lucky to draw 1,700 fans in a night. After the Texas AirHogs went bust in 2020, Major League Cricket saw its opening.\n\nPerhaps Major League Cricket’s greatest impediment toward growing the game will be getting Americans to play it. The ideological challenge—how do we get people to care about our sport?—is no different from the struggle Major League Soccer faced 30 years ago, or the one Major League Rugby, which was founded in 2017, weathers today. Of course, cricket’s idiosyncrasies can be more complicated than those in soccer or rugby; a wicket, for instance, can refer to either the pitch the sport is played on or to a key piece of equipment on that field of play.\n\nLogistically, however, cricket’s plight is unique. The sport is intended to be played on dedicated turf wickets, not grass, which precludes it from sharing space with most of the courts, fields, and diamonds this country has built over generations. Unlike soccer pre-MLS, cricket isn’t played in American schools, which removes a crucial avenue for exposing young people to the sport and rules out the scholarship incentives that keep so many athletes (and their families) invested. That flattens the player base and thus the demand for school districts or parks and recreation departments to build those turf wickets where a grass field is cheaper and more widely used, to say nothing of bargaining power that nudges change along. As a result, most games around the country are played on concrete, a poor substitute for turf, given that the ball bounces more frequently and more predictably. The lack of proper turf wickets means the average American is not even playing the same sport as the rest of the world.\n\n“I had absolutely no idea what I was coming into,” says Andries Gous, a 29-year-old South African who signed on shortly after Anderson did and will play for the Washington Freedom. “I had no idea that the infrastructure was so far behind.”\n\nSo it should come as little surprise to learn that Major League Cricket’s six markets, with a combined population of 55.2 million people across their metropolitan areas, had zero existing venues suitable for high-level cricket. Building them all from the ground up would take years Major League Cricket didn’t have if it intended to be ready for 2023. But if it could create even one, the operation would have legs.\n\nThat made the shell of AirHogs Stadium quite appealing. First, repurposing the old stadium would generate far less red tape than constructing a new one from scratch. Better still, according to William Swann, Major League Cricket’s vice president of corporate development and infrastructure, using the old stadium cut the cost in half.\n\nThere was just the matter of overhauling it. For that, Major League Cricket turned to HKS and project leads Sergio Chavez and Greg Whittemore—an unusual challenge for the latter, a self-described football guy and soccer fan. “We didn’t grow up playing cricket,” Whittemore says, “and it’s been quite an education for us.”\n\nTo catch up, they mined what they could from their surroundings, from picking the brains of U.K.- and India-based colleagues to the lessons learned from the multiuse cricket-rugby stadium HKS designed in Perth, Australia. Then Whittemore and Chavez got to tinkering. They commissioned months-long studies to determine the correct rotation of the wickets to minimize glare when players switched sides. They designed a new lighting system to replicate the effect during night matches. Out went the old seating bowl and the kitschy outfield swimming pool. In came a moving screen positioned deep behind the bowler to replicate a batter’s eye in baseball. Capacity was adjusted to 7,221, with room to expand and accommodate thousands more for big events such as the World Cup. AirHogs Stadium became Grand Prairie Stadium, the temple of American cricket.\n\nNot all the baseball touches are gone, however. “We’re going to have—I constantly say this—the world’s only cricket ground in a baseball stadium,” says Major League Cricket tournament director Justin Geale. “It’s going to be a meeting of the worlds. It’s not ideally perfect in terms of sightlines and things like that for cricket. But it’s going to be a uniquely American cricket ground and experience.”\n\nIf that reads like boosterism, that’s the point. Because if there’s one thing everyone associated with Major League Cricket—brass, players, fans, media—agrees on, it’s that high-level cricket alone won’t sufficiently capture public interest. It must be American cricket, a blank slate of a term that Anderson believes is “going to be the biggest struggle” to define.\n\nAs for what passes for American cricket in 2023, according to Della Penna, “it’s basically adult males who grew up with cricket [overseas], are wildly passionate about it, and they’re trying to sustain that passion, that love, living in America, and that’s driven the quote-unquote growth and the quote-unquote investment in the cricket communities.” The problem is, that hasn’t come hand-in-hand with a grassroots setup capable of carrying that passion outside of their communities. The sport remains too insular to encompass much of the country it’s trying to represent.\n\nSlowly, this is evolving. Asif Mujtaba settled in Plano in 2006, after a long career with the Pakistani national cricket team, where he briefly served as vice captain. In 2011, he was recruited to start the Dallas Youth Cricket League, one of the dominant youth organizations in the region. Back then, he estimates, maybe 100 kids were playing cricket in North Texas. Now he puts the number at around 1,000—a big spike, but also a pittance compared to soccer, let alone more entrenched sports such as football, basketball, and baseball. Major League Cricket can solve for some of this. It is ramping up efforts to install hybrid wickets—part clay, part synthetic grass—around the country to improve playing conditions. There are 30 league-affiliated academies around the country, a number that figures to grow once Major League Cricket delivers proof of concept that it can polish unproven talents into batsmen ready for the big stage.\n\n“All the parents want this game to grow and [to know] that my kid has a future in the sport,” Cockley says. “There’s a system, there’s a pathway, and they’re just not a number in an academy paying $300 a month with no future.”\n\nWhat the league can’t address on its own is the need to go exponentially broader, both in numbers and diversity. For instance, women simply don’t play the sport. In its most recent annual general meeting in October, USA Cricket claimed a national total of 283 registered female players.\n\nThere’s also the matter of that microscopic 0.1 percent of players outside the Southeast Asian community.\n\n“The lazy argument that always gets made is ‘You say you want American, you just mean you want White people playing,’ ” says Della Penna. “Forget about White people. Are you going to find anybody who’s Black, or Mexican American, or Japanese American, whatever? Are they going to be playing? No.”\n\nThe solution may require a moment more than it does a road map, which is where the United States national team comes in. While Americans may be new to cricket, they’ve got a century’s worth of experience tuning in to support their country in international competition and making heroes out of the victors. Imagine if North Texans get a front-row seat in Grand Prairie to a Cinderella run from the Americans at next year’s World Cup. Better still, imagine that same scenario playing out at the Olympics in five years, when the United States stands to have a much deeper roster if Major League Cricket continues to buttress the domestic talent pool.\n\n“If somehow, gods help us, we win a medal, all of a sudden you’re sitting at The Tonight Show,” says Lovkesh Kalia, who emigrated from India to Dallas in 1989 and now owns the Dallas Mustangs, the Minor League Cricket team that Anderson captains. Then the dam bursts: more awareness, more stars, more fans, more lobbying power for cricket to get in schools and carve out dedicated spaces in public parks. “It won’t be just the Indians or Pakistanis going out there and asking for something,” he says. “It’d be the overall public asking for something, like it’s happening in soccer.”\n\nAll of that is bigger than Major League Cricket. It also depends on USA Cricket—an organization historically long on turmoil and short on funds—finding stable footing. It requires USA Cricket, which knows the lay of the land, seeing eye to eye with Major League Cricket, which has achieved so many things their American counterparts never have. All of that is independent of the other checkpoints, like the other five Major League Cricket organizations getting stadiums in their own cities, or those organizations cultivating fan bases patient enough to endure their teams possibly spending the next several summers in North Texas before they ever play a match at home.\n\n“It’s a long way to go,” says Mujtaba, the Pakistani international turned youth coach, “and it takes a lot of years.”\n\nBut just as startups fail more often than they succeed, venture capitalists, as a rule, hunt growth and profits. And while finally cracking the American cricket market remains the upside play, the low-hanging fruit for an organization deeply in business with the Indian Premier League is selling a lucrative overseas rights package to the gargantuan Indian market, with its seemingly boundless appetite for world-class cricket. Far more durable cricket scenes have succumbed to that economic pressure. The Caribbean Premier League, one of the world’s most vibrant franchised leagues, aligns half of its playing schedule with prime-time viewing hours in India. What happens if Major League Cricket, with only one local fanbase to cull from out of the gate, can’t even attract the requisite 7,000 spectators to fill Grand Prairie Stadium? What if it does, only to then go the way of the Caribbean Premier League when it staged neutral-site games over a three-year period in Fort Lauderdale? They drew 10,000 people initially and then plummeted to as low as triple-digit numbers by the end.\n\n“If that’s the route they want to go, then, you know, good luck establishing and embedding yourself in the community and making people in Texas actually care,” Della Penna says. “And then all the talk and all the philosophy about, ‘Oh, we really want to become part of the Texas community. We really want to make this really big in America’—that’s all nonsense.”\n\nIt would make Major League Cricket a global financial success but an American cultural failure. And the longer it takes for the league to achieve a foothold domestically, the more likely it seems that the money behind the effort will look for a short-term payoff over long-term impact.\n\n“Eventually, you’re going to have to make a decision,” Gous says. “That’s why it’s so important to get the American market into it. Otherwise, it’s going to happen.”\n\nUntil a few months ago, the great hope of American cricket was just another lanky college junior studying accounting at UTD’s Richardson campus. Twenty-year-old Ali Sheikh was preparing for a dependable office job after graduation. What was the sense in getting starry-eyed about cricket, his passion since he was a child in Doha, Qatar?\n\nFor the longest time, it didn’t matter that a global star like Mujtaba, his coach, spotted his talent at 13 years old in their first workout together. Or that Sheikh has gone on to captain the United States under-19 team. Or that a professional like Gous regarded him as “probably the best [player] under 23 in this country,” with his combination of slick fielding and endurance honed during a varsity soccer career at Lebanon Trail High School in Frisco. Cricket in America is a hobby, not a life.\n\nThen Major League Cricket came along. After a standout performance at the league’s pre-draft combine, Sheikh found himself in Houston for the inaugural draft, where, for what felt like hours, he sat and clapped politely, secure in the knowledge that no one would be calling his name as the draft shifted into the sixth round.\n\n“And then I hear [the announcer] go, ‘Ali Sheikh,’ ” he says, “and I’m like, Hold on, that’s me.”\n\nSuddenly there he was, shaking hands on a stage and donning the cap of his new team, the Los Angeles Knight Riders. He is no longer just another accounting major walking the campus at UTD. “People at school know me as ‘the cricket guy,’ ” he says, almost bashfully.\n\nBetween the local scene, Minor League Cricket (he’s a teammate of Anderson’s on the Dallas Mustangs), and now Major League Cricket, he’s making real money in the sport. His parents are encouraging him to take a gap year to focus on his game.\n\n“At the start, I felt like it couldn’t be a full-time job,” he says. “Now I feel like it could easily be a full-time job.”\n\nMajor League Cricket is counting on exactly that. If the league reaches its potential as a cultural force in America, it won’t be on the backs of players like Corey Anderson, vital as he is. It will happen because it minted a generation of American-born stars to rise through the ranks and stake their claim as faces of both the league and the United States national team, creating competition and representation along the way.\n\n“We need,” says Geale, the Major League Cricket tournament director, “literally another 10 Ali Sheikhs.”\n\nAnd why couldn’t it happen? For all Sheikh’s gifts and drive, Cockley, who has worked with him since Sheikh was 16, is quick to note that “he also benefited from being in the right time in history.” A time when the American cricketer suddenly has an endgame to aspire to and a pathway to achieve it. When in North Texas, especially, they’ll be surrounded by sharp minds and blossoming infrastructure and world-class talent to test their skills.\n\nSheikh has yet to play a match at Grand Prairie Stadium, but as Mujtaba says, “for the young people, he is an inspiration.” There is finally something, someone, to aspire to.\n\nWhich is why Major League Cricket’s first significant victory didn’t take place in a boardroom or with a player recruitment or during a groundbreaking ceremony, but on a phone conversation a few days after the Major League Cricket draft, between Kalia’s nephew, Bhavesh, and one of the Mustangs’ next stars, 17-year-old Rishi Ramesh. “I’m gonna get serious about cricket now,” Ramesh told the younger Kalia, so much so that, when it comes time for college, he’s considering online classes at UTD to give him the flexibility needed to train and compete.\n\nRamesh has a goal in mind, and if Major League Cricket’s vision takes root, he’ll be far from the only one. He doesn’t want to become an accountant.\n\n“I want to be the next Ali Sheikh,” he said.",

    "body": "Major League Cricket, having surpassed its financial targets in a historic debut season, has unveiled its biggest signing for the fledgling competition hoped to lift the popular British Commonwealth sport to new heights in the coveted location of the U.S.\n\nAustralian cricket great Ricky Ponting has been announced as the new coach of Washington Freedom in a two-year deal that adds heft to the lucrative MLC, which lured a number of star international cricketers in its launch.\n\nSince his legendary career ended in 2012, Ponting has coached in the Indian Premier League and also been a well-regarded analyst on television in Australia, where he has showcased a knack for reading the play akin to Tony Romo's fortune-teller routine in the NFL.\n\n\"Cricket is really on the rise in the U.S. and I'm looking forward to being involved in Major League Cricket,\" Ponting said. \"I've been impressed by everyone involved at Washington Freedom.\"\n\nPonting adds gravitas to the league, which has a significant footprint from cricket powerhouses Australia and India. Cricket New South Wales has a \"strategic\" partnership with the Washington DC franchise.\n\nWashington owner Sanjay Govil said Ponting would help create \"a legacy of excellence in American cricket\". \"As we look to the future, it's clear that our ambitions require a figure of unmatched stature and expertise,\" he said.\n\n\"Ricky's legendary status, characterised by his leadership, winning mindset, and commitment to nurturing talent, aligns perfectly with our goals.\n\n\"His understanding of our vision - to enhance the sport's profile in the U.S. and to develop local talent - resonates with our mission.\"\n\nMLC is expected to expand and build from its successful debut season with more than 70,000 fans turning out to the 18-day tournament played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the rather modest Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nThe broadcast was beamed to 87 countries worldwide and importantly some games were shown live on CBS Sports Network in the U.S.\n\nAs I reported late last year, the six-team tournament had revenues of around $8 million, which was higher than the anticipated figure of $5 million.\n\nDetails of the new season will be announced soon with organizers saying that the tournament will start on July 4 and finish by early August. That means the second edition of the MLC is set to be longer with owners hoping for a home and away format, where teams play each other twice, to eventually underpin the competition.\n\n\"The ownership group in the MLC would like the next season to be a full season, but scheduling will be important,\" Anand Rajaraman, San Francisco Unicorns co-owner, told me last September.\n\n\"It should last around a month and would need double headers, but hopefully not too many games played in the heat.\"\n\nMLC has helped start to change cricket's maligned perception in a country where the sport has struggled for relevancy and been riddled with internal turmoil.\n\nWith over $100 million invested, aided by influential Indian businessmen some of whom are ensconced in Silicon Valley, MLC has been able to compete financially with many of the other high-profile T20 competitions as cricket finally makes inroads into the world's biggest sports market.\n\nMI New York - owned by Mumbai Indians owner Mukesh Ambani - are the title holders. MLC's second season is set to start days after the T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S.",
    "summary": "* The MLC has had a successful debut season, surpassing its financial targets, with revenues of around $8 million, higher than the anticipated figure of $5 million.\n* Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting has been appointed as the new coach of Washington Freedom on a two-year deal, adding credibility to the league.\n* The MLC has a significant footprint from cricket powerhouses Australia and India, with Cricket New South Wales having a strategic partnership with the Washington DC franchise.\n* The league is expected to expand and build on its successful debut season, with the second season set to start on July 4 and finish by early August, with plans to introduce a home and away format.\n* The inaugural season saw over 70,000 fans attend the 18-day tournament, with broadcasts beamed to 87 countries worldwide, including live games on CBS Sports Network in the U.S.\n* The league has invested over $100 million, backed by influential Indian businessmen, and is set to compete financially with other high-profile T20 competitions.\n* The MLC has started to change the perception of cricket in the US, where the sport has struggled for relevancy, and is expected to continue to grow in popularity.",

    "title": "Major League Cricket, game 1: Get to know the domestics for TSK and LAKR",
    "date": "Thu Jul 13 21:28:00 2023",
    "body": "It’s July 13 in sunny Dallas, Texas and that means it’s finally time for Major League Cricket. The inaugural game features Ali Khan and the Los Angeles Knight Riders against Rusty Theron and the Texas Super Kings at 7:30pm local time. The international stars of MLC are well known by cricket fans around the world, so let’s take a look at the domestics who live and play right here in the USA.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nOne of the things I love about this team is that their acronym is two letters shy of Lakers. That begs the question: Who is the Magic Johnson of the Knight Riders? This team is packed with an exciting variety of dynamic domestics. Let’s take a look at how each might factor into LAKR plans.\n\nAli Khan is the most internationally famous American product since Bart King at the turn of the 20th century. A veteran of the T20 franchise cricket circuit, Ali is also a major star for USA Cricket. Known by many as the “Yorker King,” Ali specializes in bowling the most difficult lengths for batters and consistently comes through in the toughest moments for his team. If Ali can claim wickets early, it will set the stage nicely for international stars Lockie Ferguson and Adam Zampa at the end of the power play and into the middle overs.\n\nJaskaran Malholtra almost certainly finds himself as the team’s wicket keeper, as no overseas options are included in the team. A world record holder, along with three others for smashing six consecutive sixes in an international over, Jaskaran is also featured in Jomboy Media’s ongoing Ball In Play League, an indoor hybrid of cricket and baseball designed in part to teach cricket to baseball fans.\n\nUnmukt Chand is well known for helping India claim the 2012 U19 World Cup, but his record in Minor League Cricket has shown that he still has a knack for winning big games. Unmukt captained the Silicon Valley Strikers to the championship in 2021 and back into finals weekend in 2022. Unmukt is also the career leader in runs for Minor League Cricket. It appears as if Unmukt will open the season in the playing eleven and serve as LAKR’s backup wicket keeper, should Jaskaran not perform.\n\nA fast bowling all rounder position will most likely be filled by a domestic as well, and LAKR have three strong options.\n\nSteady veteran Shadley Van Schalkwyk, a true all rounder for the Minor League Champion Seattle Thunderbolts, is the most balanced of LAKR’s options. Shadley possesses the experience and the mentality required to bowl reliably in the death, and would be a steadying presence in the late middle/early tail of the batting from the left side.\n\nCorne Dry brings a lot with the ball, as he’s shown for two seasons in Minor League Cricket leading the way for the South Division’s top team, the Atlanta Fire. The tall right arm quick can also put the ball into the seats with the bat.\n\nBhaskar Yadram is a true powerhouse with the bat, blasting sixes as far as you’ll see anybody hit them. With the ball, he almost bowls off of the wrong foot, but is effective and skillful. Though not the swiftest in the field, the U23 selection has a bright future ahead of him and is too talented to hold back for long.\n\nAlong with the splendid balance of Zampa and Narine, LAKR might want to add another spin option in their opening game against TSK. Luckily, they’ll have a good variety of spin styles to choose from domestically.\n\nUSA U19 all rounder Ali Sheikh’s tremendous performance in the draft combine resulted in his name being called before the U23 round, bringing attention to the young talent which abounds in the USA. Ali’s athleticism and effort in the field are difficult to match, and his left-arm finger spin bowling gives LAKR another bowler to trouble right handed batters.\n\nWith so many quality left handed batters in the TSK lineup, don’t be surprised to see Nitish Kumar in the team. The former Canadian Captain moved to Texas in 2021 and though his primary role is as a top order batter, Kumar is a solid right arm off spin option.\n\nTop order batter Saif Badar, who moved to the USA from Pakistan recently, could also be used as a legbreak option if LAKR opt for his bat in the team.\n\nGajanand Singh is coming off of his first ever ODI Century for USA, one of the few bright spots of the World Cup Qualifier tour. Gaj gives LAKR a left hand batting option in the middle of the order, and some handy off break bowling if needed.\n\nPredicted in the XI: Ali Khan, Jaskaran Malholtra, Unmukt Chand, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Nitish Kumar\n\nTexas Super Kings –\n\nEssentially playing at home, as well as being part of the most followed Franchise cricket brand in the world, TSK should have immense fan support at Grand Prairie Stadium on opening night.\n\nThe Super Kings first pick in the domestic draft, few cricketers enjoy the spotlight more than Rusty. While the pick surprised many, as Rusty has withdrawn himself from availability in recent tours for USA, it makes good sense when the brevity of the tournament and scarcity of quality fast bowling domestic options is taken into account.\n\nFast bowling all rounder Calvin Savage lives up to his surname in the T20 format. A knack for early wickets with the ball, Calvin sets up his slower ball well. As captain, Calvin led the unlikely Chicago Tigers to the Minor League playoffs in 2022, where the defending champion Silicon Valley Strikers needed all three games of the Conference Semifinal to knock them out. Calvin’s big bat is a major bonus and puts him in rare air among American all rounders. Along with Rusty and Jaskaran, Calvin also features in Jomboy’s Ball In Play League.\n\nPossessing perhaps the best gloves in the USA, wicket keeper Lahiru Milantha also brings a versatile, aggressive left handed bat to the TSK order. Able to take advantage in the power play, or finesse and punish spinners in the middle overs, Lahiru never looks outmatched by pace or spin.\n\nSkillfully finding gaps, especially to the off side and behind point, Sami Aslam’s batting more closely resembles swordplay than the violent ball bashing that dominates T20 cricket. But when he’s unburdened by the responsibility of leading a team, Sami’s scoring rate climbs and his talent for the format shines.\n\nWill TSK play both of these talented left handed batters, or will opt for a right handed domestic batter to balance out the order, considering LAKR’s versatile and varied bowling attack?\n\nMilind Kumar was one of the top performers in the East division of Minor League Cricket in 2022. Able to accumulate and score quickly, Milind can bat in the middle overs and handles spin bowling very well. He also provides TSK the option for right arm off break with the ball, if necessary.\n\nCody Chetty brings versatility from the right side to TSK, as he can bat at the top or middle order. Though he doesn’t bowl often at higher levels, he can provide an over or two of off break bowling if needed.\n\nWith the recently announced arrival of legbreak legend lImran Tahir, and Mitchell Santner already in the roster, the question of how many domestic spin options TSK include is an interesting one.\n\nBy taking Mohammad Mohsin in the recent “wildcard” domestic draft, TSK could be signaling the desire to double down on spin that turns away from right handed batters.\n\nZia Shahzad was taken in the initial domestic draft, an all rounder who is possibly the top right arm legbreak spin bowler in the country, and so the edge would logically go to him to start the tournament. Shahzad should gain eligibility to play for USA this year.\n\nConsidering the inclusion of Dwayne Bravo, Daniel Sams and Gerald Coetzee as overseas in the roster, it seems unlikely that right arm fast medium bowler Cam Stevenson would be in the same eleven along with Calvin and Rusty. But that doesn’t mean Stevenson won’t be included in place of one of his domestic teammates. Cam has been reliable in his role with USA cricket and has experience in T20 franchise in the BBL.\n\nAnd that leaves Saiteja Mukkamalla. There is perhaps no better young batting prospect in the country than TSK’s U23. USA Cricket’s youngest centurion, Sai is mature beyond his years and opened the batting for his New Jersey Stallions on their way to back to back finals weekend appearances in 2021 and 2022.\n\nPredicted in the XI: Rusty Theron, Calvin Savage, Lahiru Milantha, Zia Shahzad, Milind Kumar\n\nHow to watch",

Preparations are underway to dazzle fans with the second season of America's premier T20 cricket tournament, which is set to run through early August. The MLC, keen on capitalizing on the buzz from its successful maiden season, has not yet released the full schedule but promises the dates and details will unfold early next year.\n\n\"The tremendous success of the inaugural Major League Cricket season provides a perfect platform to propel American cricket to even greater heights in 2024,\" Justin Geale, Tournament Director, said. Geale's hit on a sentiment that echoes throughout the cricketing community, which has often been overshadowed by America's more traditional sports leagues, according to the City of Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nAs American sports fans gear up for tailgates and touchdowns, Major League Cricket is batting to become a new summer mainstay. With the impetus of an eagerly anticipated ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the MLC aims to enthrall audiences with a lineup of even more world-class players this upcoming season. This ambitious follow-up year is pegged as the summer spectacle for both longtime cricket enthusiasts and those new to the sport in the States.",

    "body": "Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) will be part of the first-ever Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023 clash as they take on Texas Super Kings (TSK) in the tournament opener at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Thursday, July 13. The six-team event also features Seattle Orcas, Washington Freedom, MI New York, and San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nRecently, West Indies and Kolkata Knight Riders’ (KKR) spin-bowling all-rounder Sunil Narine was named captain of the Los Angeles Knight Riders. Former West Indies batter Phil Simmons has been appointed as head coach, while Bharat Arun will be the bowling coach, Ryan Ten Doeschate the assistant coach, and AR Srikkanth the team analyst.\n\nApart from Narine, explosive England opener Jason Roy, New Zealand batter Martin Guptill, South African left-handed batter Rilee Rossouw, Kiwi pacer Lockie Ferguson and Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa are some of the prominent international players in the Los Angeles Knight Riders squad.\n\nAs LAKR gear up for their opening MLC 2023 clash, we pick the best playing XI for the franchise for the tournament.\n\nOpeners: Jason Roy and Unmukt Chand\n\nJason Roy should open the innings. He has a terrific record in T20 cricket and plenty of experience as well. In 323 matches, he has smashed 8473 runs at an average of 28.05 and a strike rate of 142.14, with six hundreds.\n\nOn his day, he can be the most explosive batter in the business. Roy was among the few positives for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2023. In eight matches, he smacked 285 runs at a strike rate of 151.60.\n\nFormer India U-19 captain, Unmukt Chand will feature in MLC 2023 as a domestic player. He has not been in great form lately but has the experience of 84 T20 games, scoring 1637 runs at a strike rate of 114.87.\n\nGiven the six overseas players limit, Martin Guptill is likely to miss out.\n\nMiddle-order batters: Rilee Rossouw, Gajanand Singh, and Jaskaran Malhotra (wk)\n\nRilee Rossouw had an inconsistent run for Delhi Capitals (DC) in IPL 2023. He scored 209 runs in nine games. However, he did show glimpses of brilliance during his scintillating 82* off only 37 balls in a game against Punjab Kings (PBKS). Los Angeles Knight Riders will expect similar knocks from him.\n\nGajanand Singh is a middle-order batter and is likely to occupy one of the domestic batting slots. He has played 22 T20s, scoring 314 runs at a strike rate of 118.93. Gajanand is also a part-time off-spinner, who can chip in if needed.\n\nAnother USA cricketer, Jaskaran Malhotra can be the keeper-batter in the Los Angeles Knight Riders playing XI. He has played 17 T20s, scoring 267 runs in the process.\n\nAll-rounders: Andre Russell and Sunil Narine (c)\n\nThe West Indies duo of Andre Russell and Sunil Narine will look to reprise the significant roles they perform for KKR.\n\nOf course, there will be additional responsibility on Narine, having been named captain of the team. Going through their numbers would be a pointless exercise since it’s a known fact that the duo are among the most experienced T20 cricketers of the current generation.\n\nRussell will be keen to play some destructive knocks and win games for the LAKR franchise. Narine will also look to utilize his bowling skills at the death. The skipper himself will be expected to deliver the goods with the ball apart from chipping in with the willow as and when needed.\n\nBowlers: Shadley van Schalkwyk, Ali Khan, Lockie Ferguson, Adam Zampa\n\nShadley van Schalkwyk and Ali Khan can be the two domestic players in the Los Angeles Knight Riders bowling line-up.\n\nVan Schalkwyk, 34, will offer a right-arm pace option. He has the experience of 94 T20s in which he has claimed 90 wickets at an average of 25.72.\n\nAli is also a right-arm pace bowler, who has picked up 53 scalps in 49 games.\n\nFast bowler Lockie Ferguson and leg-spinner Adam Zampa can be the overseas bowling options.\n\nFerguson has delivered some fantastic performances in the IPL as well as for New Zealand although his consistency remains a question mark.\n\nAs for Zampa, he is a highly underrated bowler, who is a proven match-winner with the ball in hand.",

    "title": "‘Cricket City, USA:’ Grand Prairie is home to a new sports league with deep ties for many",
    "date": "Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Grand Prairie is set to transform into “Cricket City, USA” this week as a new professional sports league launches with some of the biggest names in the sport, even if those players are little known in the U.S.\n\nAfter spending $20 million renovating the former independent league baseball AirHogs Stadium and recruiting big-name executives to invest in the startup league, bowlers and batsmen are set to take the pitch Thursday for the first match in an 18-day test of whether the fervor for the sport translates across the globe from India and South Africa to the United States.\n\nSix teams, each attached to a city and featuring some of the world’s best cricketers, will compete in an abbreviated form of cricket that decides a victor in about three hours. Top international names like England’s Jason Roy and Sri Lanka’s Wanindu Hasaranga have joined the league. There are 19 matches scheduled over 18 days, including round-robin play and four championship playoff games. Most are played at Grand Prairie Stadium with some in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nNow, with domestic interest in the sport on the rise, USA Cricket, Major League Cricket co-founder Vijay Srinivasan and investors like Anurag Jain believe it’s time for the U.S. to have its own premier cricket product. All are based in Grand Prairie.\n\n“July 13, 2023, is going to be somewhat historic,” said Marty Wieder, Grand Prairie director of economic development. “We can become Cricket City, USA.”\n\n‘This has got legs’\n\nMajor League Cricket faces an uphill battle with few venues in the U.S. and low participation at the youth and amateur levels, where interest in the sport is fostered.\n\nThe sport’s U.S. governing body, USA Cricket, also faces financial difficulties and has yet to name a CEO after multiple leadership departures. It’s put the organization in continued conflict with cricket’s global leaders.\n\nSports leagues in general are hard to start, especially in a country with no recent history with cricket.\n\nThe sport has been played for centuries in England, and international events have boosted its commercial potential in Commonwealth countries. But the U.S. has rarely been good enough to qualify for international events like the World Cup that would have put the sport on Americans’ minds, as men’s and women’s World Cups did for soccer.\n\nAnd pro cricket doesn’t have school sports participation to build on like other upstart leagues such as Major League Soccer and the Premier Lacrosse League.\n\nRelated:Flights are getting cheaper as summer travel season ramps up\n\nProfessional cricket supporters aren’t expecting to challenge the nation’s more established sports overnight.\n\n“Major League Cricket has been very cautious and very conservative,” Wieder said. “We’ll see in this first year, economically, what kind of impact it’ll have. We know it’ll be better than what we had when we had independent baseball.”\n\nMajor League Cricket does have some things in its favor. What Americans would think of as professional cricket, usually called franchised cricket, is relatively new globally. The Indian Premier League, now one of the biggest sports leagues in the world, was started in 2008. Popular leagues in other countries began even later.\n\n“When I first came in and started talking about … cricket, I think [my previous city manager] really shook his head and wondered about me,” Wieder said. “But I think he even realizes, yeah, this has got legs. This is going to be big for Grand Prairie.”\n\nMinor League Cricket, a developmental league, has already played two seasons, and the U.S. has already been chosen to co-host the 2024 T20 World Cup with the West Indies. Some of those matches are expected to be played in the newly converted stadium.\n\n‘A way of life’\n\nThe Indian Premier League is by far the most popular venue for cricket, earning nearly $17 million per match, the third-most of any sports league in the world. Its opening match this season garnered 130 million viewers, more than the 2023 Super Bowl.\n\nThe sport’s popularity is mostly concentrated in Commonwealth countries made up of the United Kingdom and its former colonies. It’s the dominant sport in nations such as India, Pakistan and Australia and an estimated billion people watched India and Pakistan play in the 2015 World Cup.\n\n“Cricket is not just a sport,” the investor Jain said. “Cricket is a way of life.”\n\nCricket has been played in the U.S. as far back as the Revolutionary War. But in the late 1800s, it lost the battle to baseball as America’s favorite bat-and-ball sport.\n\nA wave of South Asian immigrants in the 1990s brought their appetite for cricket with them to the United States.\n\nMajor League Cricket co-founders Sameer Mehta and Srinivasan capitalized on that and created one of the world’s first subscription sports live-streaming sites: Willow.tv in 2002. In 2010, the service expanded to a satellite TV station, and then to cable in 2012, using a subscription model like HBO or NFL Network.\n\nIn 2016, they sold the station to the Times Group, an Indian media conglomerate.\n\n“We were reaching a few million households,” Srinivasan said. “And we had realized that in broadcasting cricket to an audience here in the U.S., for so many years, one of our biggest frustrations was that we had never actually broadcast any matches that happened in the U.S.”\n\nMeanwhile, after tumult regarding its predecessor as the U.S.’s sanctioning cricket body, USA Cricket solicited proposals to bring cricket to the states.\n\nLovkesh Kalia, a Dallas-area hospitality businessman and former board member of USA Cricket’s predecessor, contacted Grand Prairie’s economic officials. Kalia said Grand Prairie could become the hub for cricket in the U.S.\n\nAfter identifying Grand Prairie as home base, Srinivasan and Mehta, under the banner of American Cricket Enterprises, sent their proposal to USA Cricket. The group would create Major League Cricket, but not without the proper support: funding cricket infrastructure across the country, a development league that came to be Minor League Cricket, and cultivating interest among Americans.\n\nAccording to Srinivasan, 20 groups sent proposals, and six were chosen as finalists. What placed the Texas group and their proposal for Major League Cricket above the rest was the duo’s experience with Willow.\n\n“We had a lot of data relative to cricket live audiences, what are the strongest markets in the U.S., and so on,” Srinivasan said.\n\nThe proposal was attractive to investors, too. American Cricket Enterprises has raised $44 million, including backing from Jain, Ross Perot Jr. and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who all joined as team owners or co-owners. Jain and Perot are co-owners of the Texas Super Kings, Dallas-Fort Worth’s hometown team.\n\nIn 2021, after being granted USA Cricket’s exclusive sanction, American Cricket Enterprises partnered with Grand Prairie to redevelop Grand Prairie Stadium into a cricket field.\n\n‘Perfect collision’\n\nPrevious attempts at professional cricket such as Pro Cricket and the American Premier League used minor league baseball stadiums without making them true cricket grounds.\n\nFew cities in the U.S. have stadiums equipped to handle cricket, with its unique round field.\n\nThen came Grand Prairie. The Texas AirHogs, which played in the non-MLB-associated American Association, struggled to fill its stadium’s 7,000 seats, with average attendance hovering around 1,000. The team officially folded in 2020, leaving the stadium vacant.\n\nAfter securing the use of the venue, the Major League Cricket group set out to turn Grand Prairie Stadium into the U.S.’s premier cricket ground.\n\n“It’s a lot of stress if you’re me,” said Will Swann, vice president of corporate development and infrastructure and the league’s first hire tasked to redevelop the former minor league baseball field.\n\nThe cricket league started work on the stadium retrofit in July 2022, tearing down stands to accommodate the regulation cricket field and then adding more seating to bring it back to its 7,000-person capacity.\n\nAll the prior “vertical architecture” is there — suites, concessions, team areas and the sports bar in the outfield — which was the value of renovating an existing stadium in the first place, Swann said.\n\nMajor League Cricket spent $20 million on the project. The final product is a uniquely American cricket experience that blends some of the conventions of baseball stadiums with a much different sport.\n\n“It’s almost the perfect collision of cricket and baseball,” said Swann, who was born and raised a cricket fan and player in Australia.\n\nMost of the seats are concentrated in the pavilion area. The field is closer to the stands than it would be had it not been a converted ballpark.\n\n“If you’ve ever been to a minor league baseball game, you get to be really up close and personal,” Swann said. “And imagine that kind of feeling except you have the best players in the world walking out to play.”\n\nFor the players, too, it’ll be “pretty phenomenal,” he said. Major League Cricket has 26 to 30 cameras capturing each broadcast at the stadium, giving the broadcasts unique views that haven’t been available to the sport before.\n\nSingle-game tickets in Grand Prairie start at $24.\n\nThe other venue hosting games this summer outside Raleigh, N.C., seats just over 3,000. Grand Prairie Stadium will be the league’s primary stadium until all six teams can build venues. The league is also building a training field nearby in North Texas that’s expected to be ready before next year’s T20 World Cup.\n\nRelated:UT-Dallas student Ali Sheikh highlights the rise of cricket in Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nGrassroots movement\n\nThe Dallas area was attractive as the seat for American cricket for a variety of reasons. Dallas has one of the country’s largest airports, DFW International Airport, and year-round warm weather. Jain also cited Dallas’ love of sports as a reason to invest time and money into bringing a cricket league here, especially with Dallas’ large investment community.\n\n“We just get stuff done in Dallas,” Jain said.\n\nThe league has offered discounted tickets to local amateur players and worked with youth academies on special nights for them. Some local players were drafted in the upstart league to form a relationship with the community such as University of Texas at Dallas junior and accounting major Ali Sheikh.\n\nEach Major League Cricket team is also partnered with established teams overseas. The Texas Super Kings are paired and named after the Chennai Super Kings in southern India, “the Manchester United of cricket,” as Jain put it. League executives are also counting on fans in India to tune in as they do with the Caribbean Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League.\n\nSrinivasan also knew from running Willow that there was a large base of people in Dallas who wanted to watch cricket. Dallas-Fort Worth has one of the largest South Asian communities in the country, with more than 212,000 Asian Indians alone in North Texas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That’s the fourth largest of any metropolitan area in the country. Many are cricket fans and play on Dallas’ numerous club and rec teams. There are also youth academies across the city.\n\nShreyas Viswanathan, a college freshman at Purdue University and Dallas resident, played in those academies and said he knew many people who moved to Dallas just to pursue cricket. Now, he runs The Cricket Chronicle blog and says he is one of thousands of local cricketers who are excited about Major League Cricket and ready to support it.\n\nSherwin Fernandes, another local cricketer and fan, said there has been a buzz in the community for the start of the season because of the chance to finally see some of the best cricketers live.\n\n“The who’s who of cricket is in the MLC,” Fernandes said.",

    "title": "Major League Cricket Seeks to Grow Sport in America, Seattle Franchise Included",
    "date": "Wed May  3 00:00:00 2023",
    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) represents the newest bid at growing the United States’ market for the internationally popular sport. Starting with a six-team format and a 19-day season this July, the MLC will host games exclusively at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest will be a part of the league, which was founded in 2019, as the Seattle Orcas were unveiled in March. In turn, they will provide a major league companion to Minor League Cricket’s (MiLC) Seattle Thunderbolts. Among the team’s owners are the GMR Group and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. They are backed by the Indian Premier League’s (IPL) Delhi Capitals, who are also owned by GMR. Other teams in the MLC will be based in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas, Washington D.C. and New York.\n\nJagan Nemani, head of technology and junior programs for the MLC and one of the overseers of the Orcas, emphasized the excitement around cricket and willing benefactors as essential to Seattle landing a team.\n\n“We were basically in a race against Chicago,” Nemani said, as the rival city already had two minor league teams. “We beat them to it because we were able to find not only a good pedigree of investors, [but] a growing community… as well as, you know, a good place where [the Orcas] could call home.”\n\nThat home will be at Marymoor Park in Redmond, Washington, where the team plans to build a 6,000-occupant stadium and public cricket ground—tentatively named Marymoor Community Cricket Park. The MLC is still working with King County to iron out the details of the grounds as the team will not play in Redmond for at least another year.\n\nIn terms of the league itself, the player composition in the MLC and in the international cricket scene is unique compared to predominantly American sports, like American football, where athletes play year-round for a single league. Twenty20 (T20) leagues—the type of quicker style of cricket that will be played in the MLC—rarely run for longer than two months. Professional cricketers often play in upwards of 12 leagues per calendar year, including national team play. This means there is no shortage of elite talent for the MLC to acquire, as top players are always looking for a new opportunity to join a league.\n\nThe MLC capitalized on that opportunity by first picking July for their season, as no other major T20 league will be playing at that time, according to Nemani. This will allow for players who usually play overseas in other major leagues, like the IPL’s Mitchell Marsh, to join the MLC for the season.\n\nHarmeet Singh, the first overall pick in the MLC’s recent player draft and former captain of the Seattle Thunderbolts, has confidence in the talent the league has already drawn and domestic players it could produce. Singh has played in the U.S. since 2020 and coached youth players at various academies across the country. Thanks to that experience, Singh is optimistic for cricket’s future domestically.\n\n“I think [the MLC] will be one of the better leagues around the world once it takes off, because the talent is there,” Singh said. “It’s just the talent did not have the right path. I think this is a system that we were lacking—now we have a minor league system and then we have a major league setup.”\n\nDue to the league’s short seasons, Nemani noted that the stadium’s grounds will be available for public use for a limited number of hours per week. This availability will give Redmond its first public cricket ground and provide one of the only such facilities in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nRedmond locals, like Ananth Iyer, a lifelong cricket fan and second-year chemistry major at Carleton College, were thrilled to hear of the possibility of getting such facilities in the town.\n\n“[We were] pretty much just using turf soccer or baseball fields and repurposing them to play cricket with incorrect field dimensions, because that was all we really had,” Iyer said of his time playing youth cricket in Redmond. “I feel like it’ll be a great investment that a lot of people would use.”\n\nThe MLC has also taken steps to develop the next generation of domestic cricketers. Nemani coordinates the MLC Junior Championship, a youth cricket tournament which has grown substantially over the past two years and will host 1,500 children from over 100 teams in Atlanta at the end of May.\n\nNemani also runs the league’s academy system, which provides facilities and coaching for youth players across the country.\n\n“We are developing the cricket ecosystem,” Nemani said. “So basically we have a very holistic approach in terms of developing cricket in this country, and we work with many different facets to make sure it’s happening.”\n\nThe MLC’s approach to growing cricket in the U.S. is an interesting one. With short-term plans to host a season this year while developing youth players in the long-term, it will take decades to truly gauge the league’s success. Providing the nation’s only major league platform for sport appears to be only the first step.",

Australian cricket star Adam Zampa has attracted instant headlines for America’s fledgling Major League Cricket competition - and it had nothing to do with what he did with bat or ball.\n\nThe extroverted Aussie leg spinner instead caused a storm with his choice of number on the back of his LA Knight Riders’ playing shirt. Zampa opted for number 420 - presumably as a reference to marijuana - for the match against the Texas Super Kings.\n\n'SURPRISED': Alex Carey's telling response to Jonny Bairstow Ashes outrage\n\nCLASSIC: Mitchell Starc's hilarious Alyssa Healy reveal amid Ashes battle\n\nHUGE: Michael Neser puts Ashes selectors on notice in astonishing feat\n\nThe origins of 420 are a little murky, with one suggestion it was the police radio call used for any dope related offence in the US. Another explanation is it’s the room number the Grateful Dead insisted on staying in during their touring days.\n\nA more plausible reason is it’s the codename a bunch of schoolboys gave their group in 1971 after discovering a marijuana crop in San Francisco. The boys would meet after school at 4:20pm, hence the tag.\n\nEvery year around the world, marijuana enthusiasts meet on April 20 (4/20 on the American calendar) to celebrate their love of weed and push for its decriminalisation. Zampa has not publicly declared why he chose shirt number 420 but fans have decided it’s his way of bringing a bit of life and colour to the American tournament.\n\nAdam Zampa shirt number takes internet by storm\n\nIt certainly became a major talking point. Fans from around the cricket world took to social media to speculate about Zampa’s motives for using 420.\n\nAdam Zampa remains one of cricket's quirkiest characters\n\nThe 31-year-old has long done things his way, refusing to conform to cricket’s straight-laced ways. He lives on a farm on the NSW far north coast - away from the major cricketing centres - and long ago adopted a vegan diet.\n\nHe is passionate about environmental and social issues and a keen advocate for animal welfare. Now it appears he is lending his support to another popular cause.\n\nZampa’s LA Knight Riders are co-owned by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and boast premier West Indian players Sunil Narime, Andre Russell, South African Rilee Rossouw and New Zealander Lockie Ferguson among their playing ranks.",

This follows the BCCI's proposal to introduce a year-long cooling-off period for retired players before they can participate in overseas T20 leagues. The proposal, put forward at Apex Council meeting in Mumbai yesterday, will be ratified at the BCCI's AGM in September.\n\nThe BCCI is believed to be concerned about the possibility of mass retirements by domestic players - all of whom are without contracts - to pursue opportunities elsewhere.\n\n\"We'll come out with a policy to prevent the trend of pre-determined retirement,\" secretary Jay Shah said after the Apex Council meeting. \"The office bearers will make a policy and send it back for approval.\"\n\nRelated\n\nAmbati Rayudu joins St Kitts & Nevis Patriots as marquee player for CPL 2023\n\nMLC wants more England cricketers, but not to 'start a war with anyone'\n\nBCCI approves India's participation in Asian Games\n\nBCCI allows two bouncers per over at Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy\n\nDu Plessis, Conway, Santner reunite with coach Fleming at Texas\n\nRayudu announced his retirement ahead of Chennai Super Kings' fifth IPL triumph, in Ahmedabad in May. At the time, Rayudu, who had previously retired only to make a comeback, had promised \"no U-turn\".\n\nTwo weeks later, he was named along with a number of other present and former Super Kings players such as Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner, as signings for the Texas franchise, which is also run by N Srinivasan's India Cements that also owns Chennai Super Kings. The Texas team will be coached by Stephen Fleming with Eric Simons and Albie Morkel as assistants coaches.\n\nAs things stand, Indian players can feature in overseas T20 leagues only if they are retired from international cricket and BCCI-run tournaments such as the IPL. Unmukt Chand, the former India Under-19 World Cup winner, is an example of a player who left Indian cricket to pursue opportunities overseas.\n\nChand announced his decision in 2021, aged 28. Since then, he has featured in the Big Bash League for Melbourne Renegades and Bangladesh Premier League for Chattogram Challengers.\n\nMLC 2023 is a six-team event, scheduled from July 13 to 30.

    "body": "In a relief to both Major League Cricket (MLC) and Minor League Cricket (MiLC), both USA Cricket and International Cricket Council (ICC) have sanctioned the two leagues. While the USAC announced its nod in a media statement few hours ago, it is reliably learnt that ICC has given the green signal too.\n\n“USAC is pleased to announce the sanctioning of the Major League Cricket (MLC) and Minor League Cricket (MiLC) tournaments for 2023. Over the past few months, we have worked diligently with Ace to ensure that the MLC and MiLC are positioned well to support the growth of cricket in the United States,” a media release by USA Cricket stated.\n\nAlso Read: Cricket Could be a Catalyst in Strengthening India’s Bilateral Ties With Saudi Arabia\n\nHours after the USA Cricket release, ICC too has sanctioned the two leagues and have allowed the Members to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to players invited to participate in the two leagues.\n\n“ICC has sanctioned the Major League Cricket and Minor League Cricket events. Members are free to issue NOC to any of their invited players to participate in these events should they wish to do so,” a ICC source told News18 CricketNext.\n\nIndustry sources tracking developments revealed that the delay in sanctions was a ploy by the USAC to revise terms of the original agreement it had signed with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) – the group behind the two leagues – back in 2019. The media release hinted at a possibility of reviewing the original agreement.\n\n“We are pleased with Ace‘s commitment and best efforts to include all the current men’s national team players in the major league tournament. Additionally, we look forward to working with Ace to provide governance of the tournaments. Finally, we will review our commercial relationship with Ace over the next few months,” the release added.\n\nAlso Read: ICC Committee May Propose 37% Revenue Share for BCCI From 2024-2027 Cycle\n\nLast month, days after the historic MLC draft, ICC shot an email to its members and urged them to not issue NOCs (No Objection Certificate) to its players for the two leagues. The ICC had no option but to send the note as the process to sanction the league had not reached the global cricketing body.\n\n“The reason the note was sent to Members was that the process to sanction the league has not yet reached the ICC not that there are any perceived issues. For any domestic league involving overseas players from a Full Member the Associate Member must get the event sanctioned,” an ICC source had told News18 CricketNext.\n\nThe MLC will be a six-team competition featuring Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom. The tournament is set to begin in July this year and will see participation from international stars like Aaron Finch, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Marsh, Quinton de Kock and others.\n\nThere is plenty of Indian interest, apart from the team ownership, as the likes of Unmukt Chand, Harmeet Singh, Smit Patel and Milind Kumar will turn up for their respective teams.\n\nWhile Unmukt, Smit and Harmeet were part of the India U-19 squad which won the 2012 World Cup, Milind was a consistent performer in the domestic circuit for Delhi before he moved base to Sikkim and Tripura.\n\nUSA Cricket election results announcement\n\nIn another development, USA Cricket announced delayed results for the 2021 elections. Arjun Gona was elected as the Individual Director while Srinivas Salver and Anj Balusu were elected unopposed as Male Director and League Director respectively.\n\nThe voting for the aforementioned posts ended over a week back but there was a delay in announcement of the results of already delayed polls.",

    "title": "Major League Cricket, with $120M pledged, pitches a new T20 venture in the U.S.",
    "date": "Thu Jun  9 00:00:00 2022",
    "body": "In the late 18th century, when Great Britain’s 13 North American colonies were desperately battling for their independence, soldiers in the rag-tag Continental Army would play various games while encamped in places such as Valley Forge, Pa.\n\nOne game was a form of cricket, a sport that would maintain relative popularity in the new United States for decades. Yet when another war raged across the new nation, this time a far bloodier civil war, a new sport had evolved that would overtake the decidedly British game of cricket – baseball.\n\nEarly baseball clubs nabbed some of the best American cricket players, and journalists started writing about baseball.\n\nThe rest is history: While cricket’s American popularity faded, it erupted across Britain’s global-spanning empire, particularly in India and the West Indies. That’s helped make it the world’s most popular sport after soccer – except in the U.S. of A., where even baseball was pushed aside for American football.\n\nVarious unsuccessful attempts have been made to re-introduce cricket to American audiences, and while it thrives at a local level in places, particularly those with large South Asian populations, it remains something of a distant, confusing sport to many.\n\nNow, a monied group of mostly prominent South Asian investors have launched Major League Cricket with the intent of creating a professional league – really tournaments that last six weeks or so – in hopes of capitalizing on the ex-pat communities of cricket fans across the U.S. The goal is to begin play in summer 2023.\n\nQuestion is, can this effort find its footing and become a viable lower-tier property in the crowded American sports market?\n\nMajor League Cricket’s backers – the effort is formally American Cricket Enterprises – say they have the money, game format, built-in audience and business plan to make it work.\n\nLast month, the group announced it had secured $44 million in Series A funding with another $76 million available over the next year. The money will be used to build or retrofit cricket stadiums and training academies, and for other start-up and development expenses.\n\nAmerican Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in 2019 landed the commercial development rights with USA Cricket, the game’s formal sanctioning body in the cricket world, to help finance, develop, and grow the nation’s men’s and women’s national teams – a vital relationship because cricket globally is most popular at the national team level rather than professional leagues. The deal means a long-term investment by ACE of $1 billion to develop cricket domestically at the professional, amateur and national team level.\n\nThat said, the development of what’s called Twenty20 (T20) cricket nearly two decades ago may be the thing that helps Major League Cricket find success. T20 is a shortened high-scoring version of the game, which traditionally was played in matches that took a day or several days to complete. It’s now immensely popular in India and other cricket-playing nations, some of which are developing even shorter versions of the game.\n\nT20 matches are about three hours long – something American sports audiences are used to on television or in person. That’s the magic ingredient MLC’s organizers say will make it work domestically.\n\n“All it will take is a casual fan to watch one of these games, in our stadiums or on TV, it’s so action packed,” Major League Cricket co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told The Athletic last week. “It’s a product that will stand on its own for entertainment for fans. It’s very high-scoring. It’s pretty rowdy and wild but still safe and family-oriented. It’s non-stop noise and entertainment and music, plus all the food.”\n\nThe world’s most-watched cricket league is the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is a T20 league launched in 2008 and is expected to soon land new media distribution rights reportedly worth more than $6 billion.\n\nOne prominent cricket observer agrees that T20 format can help make MLC work here.\n\n“The object is to score as rapidly as possible. The scoring can be quite spectacular. Guys are smashing this ball every which way,” said Stefan Szymanski, a University of Michigan sports management professor and co-author of the recent book Crickonomics: The Anatomy of Modern Cricket. “It could attract interest. The problem is how to get people to start, to give it a go.”\n\n(For T20 and general cricket rules/terms, visit here and here).\n\nInitially, the league intends to market itself to the millions of cricket fans, particularly from South Asia, already living in the United States, Srinivasan said.\n\n“We are very fortunate and in a unique position that we have a large and passionate audience for our sport in the U.S.,” he said. “We think we’ll be an immense success if we’re successful with that audience.”\n\nCricket fans living in North America tend to be wealthier and willing to pay to travel to watch top-tier matches, Srinivasan said.\n\n“We have a good understanding where the audience for cricket lives,” he said.\n\nSrinivasan in 2002 co-founded the Willow TV premium cable channel that broadcasts and streams cricket to about 4 million U.S. homes. He sold it in 2016 to India’s The Times Group media conglomerate but maintains close contact with its executives – including Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain, who are principals at The Times Group and investors in Major League Cricket.\n\nWillow and ESPN are likely candidates for MLC’s broadcast and streaming rights for live matches.\n\nAt the top of the global cricket pyramid is the 10-team IPL, which gets hundreds of millions of viewers and match attendees. While MLC isn’t trying to be that league, its popularity amongst U.S.-based viewers signals that there could be an appetite here.\n\n“These people had no domestic product in the U.S. to go watch a game,” Srinivasan said. “These things led us to believe the time is right for a home grown product.”\n\nThat helped Srinivasan and other organizers to successfully pitch the MLC idea to investors, some of whom will become team owners in the single-entity structure league (akin to Major League Soccer, which doesn’t have franchised clubs).\n\n“That’s the expectation as we formalize league structure,” Srinivasan said. “The investors will morph into a well-defined ownership group, take on next stage of growth, more investment of teams.”\n\nThe internal financial modeling predicts the new league will break even or turn a profit within five to seven years – something Srinivasan said the investors understand. Among the business executives and tech entrepreneurs putting money into MLC, perhaps the most high-profile investor name is Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO and executive chairman. Adobe Inc. CEO and Chairman Shantanu Narayen is investing, too.\n\nAlso among the investors is Ross Perot Jr., son of the 1992 presidential candidate and tech billionaire Ross Perot Sr.\n\nThe $120 million will be used to build, retrofit or upgrade cricket grounds and training academies in several announced markets – Dallas, Seattle, San Jose, Orange County, Calif., and Morrisville, N.C. Another possible site is in Houston, and more stadiums or locations are being scouted in the Northeast, where there are already pockets of cricket fans and players.\n\nThe venues will seat 6,000 to 10,000 fans, or more, with temporary seating expansion possible for major events. The game-day experience will be familiar to fans of other sports: Rowdy cheering, music and entertainment, food and drink, etc.\n\nIs the $120 million pledged to launch Major League Cricket enough?\n\n“I think with the funding commitment we have, we’ll be set for the first few years of the league and the infrastructure work we’re envisioning,” Srinivasan said.\n\nAdditional revenue will come from corporate advertising deals, venue naming rights and media broadcast rights contracts, merchandise sales, data, fantasy sports, gambling, and game-day cash from tickets and concessions.\n\nThe organization’s 26-team semi-pro Minor League Cricket, which begins its 10-week season June 25 in 20 cities, launched in 2021 and has sponsorship deals with Toyota and Sunoco.\n\nThe MLC season structure is still under development but likely will include up to 30 matches per team. Organizers are trying to find the calendar sweet spot that allows IPL and players in other top competitions to play in the U.S.\n\nTop pro cricketers earn about $1 million or more for a season, with many players earning a few hundred thousand dollars for various tournaments. Without revealing pay structure details, MLC backers say player compensation will be on par with the cricket competitions a step below the Indian Premier League.\n\nCricket professionals typically play for their national team as their top gig, and they play in several professional leagues/tournaments each year. They’re not bound to a single club, but while the money is pretty good it’s still not on par for most with what the legacy U.S. major leagues pay their players.\n\n“No cricketer gets paid like a professional baseball player,” Szymanski said.\n\nWhich is ironic, given cricket’s early ties to baseball.\n\n“Most of the early baseball players were cricketers,” Szymanski said. “Henry Chadwick, the father of baseball himself, began life as a cricket journalist and remained so.”\n\nThe Cincinnati Red Stockings famously hired cricketer Harry Wright to pitch, field, and manage. The future Cooperstown enshrinee led an unsuccessful baseball/cricket tour of England in the 1870s, but it was evident by then that the money was in the American game.\n\n“Baseball offered a more profitable opportunity,” Szymanski said.\n\nElsewhere in the world, cricket tended to follow expansion of the British empire, and remained popular after that empire receded and nations achieved independence.\n\n“If we’d successfully suppressed the rebellion, Americans would be playing cricket,” said the British-born Szymanski, chuckling.\n\nBut they didn’t suppress cricket. Baseball did. And that’s a test for trying to reintroduce the game beyond ex-pat followers and their family and friends.\n\n“Launching a cricket league in the United States is something that is going to present a challenge for anybody,” Szymanski said. “They’ve identified a niche market of Indian expats who are likely to be interested and that is potentially a very good market. Most Indians in India are obsessed with cricket. It goes beyond anything you see in American sports and even soccer in terms of committed fandom. These star players rise to the level of a god. Whether it catches on here in America is a question mark.”\n\nMLC potentially has an in-road with American audiences via a developing partnership with Jimmy “Jomboy” O’Brien, founder of a popular sports-based social media empire and a relatively recent fan of cricket. His Jomboy Media company has done some content work with MLC, and O’Brien produced cricket educational content.\n\nO’Brien said he lived for a couple of years in Australia as a boy and played sandlot cricket with friends. After many years away from it, his interest was again piqued last fall when his son was born, and daytime TV sports during his paternity leave included cricket.\n\n“I got super into it,” O’Brien said. “It’s a bat-to-ball skill sport. It’s s a lot of thinking and strategy. A lot of that is similar to why I like baseball.”\n\nHe’s aware of MLC’s plans and expects to eventually have formal talks with its backers on potential formal affiliation. Does he think Major League Cricket can make it?\n\n“It’s going to be really tough and I’m glad they’re trying,” O’Brien said. “If they get top players, cricket fans will tune in.”\n\nThat’s the plan, Srinivasan said. MLC already has signed professional players to participate in the inaugural season, but names haven’t been disclosed.\n\nBecause of the T20’s popularity, competition for the world’s best players will be fierce and potentially costly. But if MLC wants legitimacy with the domestic audience, it will have to pay for talent.\n\nThere are about 4 million people from India or of Indian descent, and nearly 500,000 from Pakistan, living in the United States, per Census data. There are also pockets of cricket fans from the sport’s other powerhouse nations – England, the West Indies (the Caribbean island nations collectively play under that name), Sri Lanka, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Afghanistan.\n\nThere are roughly 200,000 cricket players in the U.S. participating in more than 400 local leagues, tournaments, academies, college and school program, per USA Cricket.\n\nAmerican Cricket Enterprises has to get a sizeable chunk of these fans and players to tune in or attend MLC matches.\n\n“A challenge is to convince the local population of the merits of the sport,” said Joel Seymour-Hyde, managing director of the British office of Octagon, the global sports and entertainment marketing, consultant, and talent agency. “Can you create a product that’s good enough locally to fill stadiums to create and atmosphere and buzz?”\n\nExpectations and internal success metrics are key.\n\n“You’ve got to set realistic goals and not assume you can be the fourth biggest sport in the U.S. in five or ten years’ time,” Seymour-Hyde said. “You don’t have to be huge to be a successful commercial operation.”\n\nSzymanski echoed those sentiments.\n\n“At some level, cricket leagues in the U.S. are viable. The question is whether it will be a small niche activity or gain a wider appreciation in American society,” he said. “If you aim to match the NFL in level of interest in the near future then you’re doomed to disappointment and failure pretty quickly. There also is peril in not being ambitious enough. You’ve seen that to some extent in MLS. It’s where old European players go to die – that has hurt MLS.”\n\nThe graveyard of failed sports leagues in America is pretty crowded, and the road to profitability (or just breaking even) can be long. Failure occurs for myriad reasons – some beyond anyone’s control, such as COVID-19 wrecking many sports endeavors in 2020.\n\n“(The pandemic) did probably set back the league from 2022 to 2023. What that gave us is a timeframe to get some of our venues in place by then,” Srinivasan said. “We’ve managed to get out feet wet in terms of organizing events of a national scale, with player contracting and getting our venues ready.”\n\nAnother obstacle for non-fans is cricket’s rules and terminology. And cricket’s reputation is that of a sport that can take literally days to play and employs a terminology foreign to U.S. fans of the other major leagues. What’s a wicket, over, and innings?\n\n“You have to drop some of the words – the toughest thing is the language of the sport,” O’Brien said. “Slang has become the official definition of things.”\n\nCricket education also is part of MLC’s business plan.\n\nOn the upside, the endeavor is happening at a time when TV networks and tech giants are spending princely sums for live sports content to populate their streaming services. Last year, for example, ESPN inked a five-year, $10 million-plus steaming rights contract with Cricket West Indies, a deal that includes 58 T20 matches.\n\nMLC could enjoy a similar deal, and said an announcement is coming soon. ESPN and Willow TV are the obvious leading contender for such rights deals. ESPN parent Disney bought the CricInfo website in 2007 and today the @espncricinfo Twitter account has 6.6 million followers.\n\nTelevision and streaming are key to making MLC work. The U.S. is often second after India when it comes to TV audience for cricket’s internationally televised tournaments, Seymour-Hyde said, and that’s driven by the ex-pat population. And the fact that cadre of fans lives in the United States is even more enticing to organizers, even if many sports – soccer, rugby, lacrosse – also are trying to carve out niches.\n\nSrinivasan said studies show that the potential U.S. cricket audience is more than 10 million and perhaps up to 20 million viewers. That many eyeballs would certainly interest advertisers.\n\nWhile MLC’s deal with USA Cricket includes help for both the men’s and women’s national teams, the pro league will begin as men’s only. The venues and academies will be available for potential women’s teams and leagues, the group said.\n\nAlso potentially giving MLC a leg up is cricket’s T20 World Cup, which the United States and West Indies will co-host in 2024. “All eyes of the world of cricket will be on the US in ’24,” Srinivasan said.\n\nWhile the challenges are evident, the fact that there’s a sizeable ex-pat audience, the coming T20 World Cup, the media industry’s thirst for live sports content, and cricket potentially returning to Olympic competition – it was last played in the 1900 Summer Games in Paris – looks to be an alignment of stars for Major League Cricket.\n\n“A good as moment as they could find to give it a go. I don’t think you can see a better opportunity,” Seymour-Hyde said.\n\n(Top photo: Peter Della Penna / Courtesy of Major League Cricket)",

    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) finally got under way in the US last week after several false starts, fuelling hopes the sport is poised to break new ground in a huge new market on the back of the popular Twenty20 format.\n\nFive years after USA Cricket shared its plans to launch a domestic T20 tournament, the inaugural edition of the MLC kicked off having assembled an impressive array of investors.\n\nFour of its six franchises are owned by business entities which also own teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the money-spinning standard bearer of franchise cricket.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is co-owner of the MLC’s Seattle franchise, while Washington and San Francisco franchises have strategic partnerships with the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria.\n\nWhile franchise-based competitions are springing up all around the world, Tom Dunmore, MLC’s marketing vice-president, said the US competition cannot be dismissed as “just another T20 league”.\n\n“We’re building stadiums and youth academies, we’re building training centres and bringing in coaches and players,” he told Reuters from Dallas.\n\n“Those will be available for the US national teams as well. It’s not really like other T20 leagues that are using existing facilities in cricket-mad countries.”\n\nThough cricket remains a niche sport in the US it has been around for a long time in the country — the first international cricket match took place in New York in 1844 with the US taking on Canada.\n\nThe MLC could be cricket’s vehicle to break into a sporting landscape dominated by baseball, basketball and American football, Dunmore said.\n\n“We’re cracking a new market for the sport,” he added. “Cricket hasn’t really broken into a major new market for some time.\n\n“So this is a chance not only to do that, but to do it in the world’s biggest commercial market.”\n\nDunmore said cricket’s existing fan base in the US made it the sport’s fifth-largest market.\n\n“If we slice off even a small percentage of the rest of the population, you’ve got a massive market.”\n\nWest Indies’ Kieron Pollard, one of the first players to fully embrace franchise cricket, was confident MLC would take cricket “prime time” in the US, even though others had failed to break open the market.\n\n“Obviously before MLC, different people have tried different things,” the 36-year-old, who leads the league’s New York franchise, said.\n\n“But now the difference is the backing of the Indian franchises and the international players that are coming.”\n\nSuccess on the global stage would help boost cricket’s profile in the US, and while there has been no big breakthrough as yet Pollard said they are getting closer.\n\nA US team featuring players mostly of Indian origin made it to the 50-overs World Cup qualifiers in June but failed to make the cut for the main tournament in India later this year.\n\nBut the experience of rubbing shoulders with the likes of former SA captain Faf du Plessis and England international Jason Roy would stand them in good stead, Pollard said.\n\n“It augurs well for US cricket, and hopefully the young talent that is there in America can use this opportunity to grow into better international cricketers,” he added.\n\nCo-hosting the T20 World Cup next year with West Indies will also give the game a boost in the US.\n\nThe launch of the MLC assumes even more importance coming at a time when the International Cricket Council (ICC) is lobbying for the game’s Olympic inclusion at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\nDunmore said the MLC was providing cricket much-needed visibility as the game bids to return to the Olympics for the first time since 1900.\n\n“The crowds and the excitement, the buzz, the media attention both in the US and globally, now that’s truly helpful,” he added.\n\nICC CEO Geoff Allardice acknowledged the buzz MLC has created in the US.\n\n“There are a number of developments in the US that are helping to raise awareness of the game.\n\n“The start of the MLC is one of them, they draw a lot of attention to the sport,” Allardice said last week.\n\nReuters",
    "summary": "* The MLC, a domestic T20 tournament, has finally launched in the US after several false starts, with six franchises, four of which are owned by business entities that also own teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n* The inaugural edition of the MLC aims to break new ground in the US market, with investors including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who co-owns the Seattle franchise.\n* The tournament is not just another T20 league, but a comprehensive effort to develop cricket infrastructure in the US, including stadiums, youth academies, and training centers.\n* Cricket has been present in the US since 1844, but remains a niche sport; the MLC aims to change this, leveraging its existing fan base, which makes it the fifth-largest market for cricket.\n* Success in the MLC could help cricket break into the US sporting landscape, currently dominated by baseball, basketball, and American football.\n* The presence of international players, including Kieron Pollard, and strategic partnerships with Australian states, will help raise the profile of cricket in the US.\n* The MLC's launch is timely, as the International Cricket Council (ICC) is lobbying for cricket's inclusion in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, and the tournament's success will provide much-needed visibility for the sport.",

    "body": "Move over, pickleball. There’s an even bigger sport in town.\n\nThis week, Major League Cricket will play its first-ever game in the U.S. and every last ticket to the highly anticipated opener has been sold. (Don’t worry, it’s also being broadcast live.) The Texas Super Kings will face off against the Los Angeles Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Thursday. The 6,000-person venue replaced the former home of the professional baseball team, the AirHogs. Anurag Jain, the managing partner of venture capitalist firm Perot Jain, is part-owner of the Texas Super Kings and founded the Dallas-based franchise earlier this year in hopes of creating a buzz stateside.\n\n“My vested interest was to bring cricket right into the heart of America,” Jain told Bloomberg. “I see a lot of cricket being played one off, club level, league level, at the local levels. But not at the professional level and that’s what I really wanted to change.”\n\nCricket is currently ranked as the second-biggest sport in the world right behind soccer, and Jain’s not the only one betting on its future. Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside business mogul Jay Mehta, acquired the Knight Riders back in 2020 and has plans to build his own state-of-the-art cricket stadium 40 miles outside L.A. The $30 million venture is being spearheaded by Major League Cricket and designed by award-winning architecture firm HKS.\n\nHistorically, the bat and ball sport has struggled to develop a fan base outside of India, South Africa, Australia, and the U.K. However, deep-pocketed investors are willing to put an impressive $120 million into the U.S. league to expand its profile in America, Bloomberg reported.\n\nOf course, with this kind of financial backing, cricketers from across the globe want in on the action. The Texas Super Kings have since signed overseas players including Devon Conway, Dwayne Bravo, and David Miller. Veteran South African batter Faf du Plessis has also joined the team as captain, while West Indies spinner Sunil Narine leads the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\n“American sports fans want to see the best in the world,” MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told BBC Sport. “That’s the demand in U.S. professional sports.”",
    "summary": "* The Major League Cricket (MLC) tournament is set to play its first-ever game in the US this week, with a sold-out crowd of 6,000 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.\n* The inaugural match will feature the Texas Super Kings against the Los Angeles Knight Riders on Thursday, which will also be broadcast live.\n* The Texas Super Kings franchise was founded by Anurag Jain, Managing Partner of venture capitalist firm Perot Jain, who aims to bring professional cricket to the US.\n* Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and business mogul Jay Mehta own the Los Angeles Knight Riders and plan to build a state-of-the-art cricket stadium outside of Los Angeles.\n* The MLC has received significant investment of $120 million to develop the sport in the US, with the goal of expanding its fan base beyond traditional cricket-loving countries.\n* The league has attracted top international players, including Devon Conway, Dwayne Bravo, David Miller, Faf du Plessis, and Sunil Narine, who will play for the Texas Super Kings and Los Angeles Knight Riders.",

    "body": "19.3 to Imad Wasim , Misses the reverse lap, gets hit on the pad right in front. Lbw given right away. Imad was walking, turned back to go for a last-ditch review. It was a fullish ball that hit him in front of off, his feet were bent and he tried to slice it away Eoin-Morgan-to-Ravi-Rampaul style, sans the follow-through. Got hit in front of all three. Hawk-Eye shows it was going on to hit middle and off. 168 / 6\n\n3.6 to Q de Kock , Zampa's lucky to have QDK holed out at mid-off. QDK danced down the ground, read the googly and got to the pitch of the ball. But it was on leg stump and the shot attempted aimed to go over mid-off/extra cover. He toed it straight to Narine, who jumped a bit and took it around chest-height. Zampa did toss the ball up there.. 32 / 1\n\n13.1 to SS Ranjane , Slog sweep is top edged. Flies straight to deep forward square. It was a bit too full and slow for the shot. 104 / 4\n\n4.6 to Nauman Anwar , Taken at short third but the batter's staying in, they're checking for the no-ball. Not front-foot but a second-bouncer thing. Anway leant back and tried to ramp it. Couldn't manufacture enough room, the ball looked a bit around shoulder height but Anwar was leaning back. That means the bouncer isn't too high. Spencer timed his jump well at short third and took a high catch took his right. Anwar's quickfire 32 comes to an end. 45 / 2\n\n8.4 to H Klaasen , Narine outsmarts Klaasen to knock over the stumps. Klaasen made room again but Narine darted a carrom ball on a length. The around-the-wicket angle took the ball away. Klaasen tried to go over cover again, the ball kept low. Klaasen tried to get low and check his shot, missed it and got his off stump rattled. 81 / 3\n\n1.2 to JS Malhotra , Jayasuriya runs back and takes an excellent catch. He was looking up and hobbling a bit, managed to watch it through and lunge forward to maintain balance. The ball was on a back of length over middle, Malhotra was dancing down. Gave a bit of room to himself and tried to flap it over midwicket. Top edge takes it to backward point. 4 / 1\n\n1.6 to G Singh , Gannon's too quick, has Gajanand glove the pull back to the keeper. Not that short a ball. It was around waist-height, coming into the body. Gajanand tried to pull it fine but got cramped. It went right up and QDK took a dolly. Gannon's got two off his first.. 8 / 2\n\n16.2 to A Zampa , Jones comes in from deep cover and takes a good sliding catch. Ball was on a length outside off, Zampa sliced it off the top edge in an attempt to carve it squarer. Man from cover was running back but had to pull out, Jones chugged at full steam to make it. 135 / 8\n\n4.4 to Saif Badar , Top edge off the slashing blade is taken at point. Saif goes, LAKR reeling at 22 for 4. Saif was walking down and got a hard-length ball outside off. Tried to go over the infield, got caught by Anwar. 22 / 4\n\n13.1 to SP Narine , There's one. Tries to take on the midwicket boundary but the slower ball foxes Narine. It was on a length around off, Narine had an almighty smite at it but got it off the toe. Bread-basket catch for the man in the deep. Tye pumps the air in celebration. 105 / 6",

    "title": "Cricket's US Foray at Nervous Stage With Major League Cricket",
    "date": "Tue Jul  4 08:29:09 2023",
    "body": "In the last few years, there has been lot of noise around taking cricket to the US. So much that the International Cricket Council made them the “co-hosts” of the 2024 T20 World Cup along with the West Indies. Suspense and drama continues over that move because, as News18 CricketNext reported last month, the tournament could be shifted to England due to under-preparedness of cricket infrastructure in the US and the ongoing governing issues.\n\nThe larger question remains: is US ready to welcome cricket?\n\nUnlike other regions, US is a market that’s distinct from say India, England or Australia. For the Americans, sport needs to be a spectacle, a source of entertainment and for them getting maximum entertainment/return for the dollar spent is more important than the perfect outswing or a glorious cover drive.\n\nOver the last few weeks, News18 CricketNext spoke to numerous people in the US – from administrators to expats to fans and all acknowledged hosting just a cricket match in the US is not going to do the trick. Even for the expats, every delivery has to be “an event” and a source of entertainment.\n\n“The way professional sport is presented in America, it’s very different. Every time there is a stoppage in play, there is an activation going on. There is something going on in the stadium or in the crowd. So you have to think about how you will present a show. They don’t call going to a show in baseball for no reason at all. When we went to see the Dallas Wings play, when we went to see Angel City Soccer, there is a lot of stuff going on around the actual sport. So you have to build that along with what you are doing,” says Shaun Martyn, founder of FairBreak Global.\n\nMartyn was set to host an edition of the FairBreak Global Invitational tournament in the US in September but decided to postpone it. For him, it was a strategic call to use the time to understand the “educated” American audience and the team at FairBreak “collectively agreed” to prepare for the “spectacle” and give their best shot.\n\n“I don’t know whether I am right in that view and it’s more of a gut feeling I have. Everything we have done so far, we have put in a lot of thought into it. The American sporting audience is highly educated. Not that others around the world aren’t, but American sporting audience is very educated. The way they do sports there is like you are going to a place of entertainment. Collectively our team asked are we putting on a show to engage the US audience? Especially with the expectations they have when they go for other sports. Last year in August I went to watch a college football match in the US and there were 66,000 people in attendance. Putting on a spectacle demands a lot of thought and preparation. That’s what we as a team realised and collectively agreed upon,” adds Martyn.\n\nThe Major League Cricket test\n\nFinally, the inaugural edition of the MLC gets underway on July 13 at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas and everyone will be closely tracking the response of the tournament which has no dearth of star power. Four IPL franchises – Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals, Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians – have acquired teams and top international players will be in action from July 13-July 30.\n\n“The big test will be the MLC. If the MLC doesn’t take off, then nothing will, trust me on this. US is a very difficult market to penetrate. And you don’t get too many shots at that. One miss and you are gone. So MLC can’t afford to mess it up. Not just for them but for the overall future and popularity of the game. Right now, all the infrastructure and governance can take a backseat. MLC has to put on a real show and keep the audience engaged and interested for over two weeks. Out of curiosity and excitement, it will be easy to get the fans to the stadium once, but the key would be to make them come again. Even if it’s the large expat base,” says a veteran cricket administrator in the US.\n\nThe organisers have planned a drone show and fireworks for the opening night of the MLC and more such initiatives will be seen during the course of the tournament. The tickets for the matches start at $30 and American fans certainly want maximum return for every dollar spent.\n\n“The opening night of Major League Cricket will be an unforgettable experience for fans on and off the field. The drone show, fireworks and the pageantry traditional to American sporting events will provide a thrilling stage for the world’s best cricketers competing in the inaugural match of Major League Cricket,” Sameer Mehta, Co-founder, Major League Cricket, said in a statement.\n\nNot just the organisers of MLC, everyone from ICC to various other stakeholders will be tracking the tournament. MLC could well turn out to be the springboard for cricket in the region or the anchor which takes the entire ship down.\n\nEven for Martyn and FairBreak, success of MLC is important because it will “create interest in the US”.\n\n“We want the MLC to be successful because it will help create interest in the US. I personally think women’s cricket will be very successful in America. I think it will do what women’s soccer has done in America. In terms of our mission which is around social impact – what we do and how we change lives around for women. That is our very clear focus.\n\n“For cricket to be very successful in America, the expat community is going to be very important for us. The community will play a major role in moving cricket into American sporting psyche and help making it successful on a long term basis. Purely from a women’s cricket perspective, we wanted to spend some more time educating the people what FairBreak does. Probably the next month, I will be announcing something which is going to be very exciting and will further underpin what I am talking about in terms of establishing our brand there. It wasn’t about using the MLC opportunity but about what we want with our brand in the US market,” says Martyn.\n\nThe expats are excited for the start of MLC as it gives them an opportunity to see their favourite stars from close quarters. They, however, want to keep their expectations in check. India and West Indies have played few T20Is in US in the past, and will again play in a series next month, but MLC serves cricketing action featuring top international stars for more than two weeks.\n\n“We are excited to see these international players. We are also realistic when it comes to expectations. Let’s be honest, it’s not going to be the IPL or anywhere close to it. Idea is to enjoy these matches and hope it gets the desired attention in the region. There won’t be any Indian players in the league, I mean the active ones, so let’s see how things unfold,” says a financial executive from India, settled in US since the last 10 years.\n\nThe next few weeks will decide whether the noise around bringing cricket to the US turns into music or fades away like a broken record. As most have said, cricket won’t get many shots to penetrate the US market.",

    "body": "Major League Cricket, the much-anticipated new professional T20 league hoped to finally ignite the sport in the U.S., has been officially sanctioned after a dispute between U.S.A. Cricket and league organizers threatened to jeopardize the launch of the historic competition.\n\nAccording to sources, the International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - has sanctioned MLC and Minor League Cricket. Both tournaments have been supported and approved by U.S.A. Cricket.\n\nThe sanctioning means that ICC members can issue No Objection Certificates to their players who want to compete in the MLC which starts in July.\n\nThe ICC last month deemed MLC and Minor League Cricket as \"disapproved\" and stated that \"members should not issue NOCs to their players to participate in either event\".\n\nBoth events are administered by American Cricket Enterprises, which signed a 50-year commercial rights agreement with U.S.A. Cricket in 2019. There has been warring between them with ACE concerned about tumult hitting U.S.A. Cricket, which includes high-profile leadership duo Paraag Marathe and Iain Higgins having left their roles in contentious circumstances.\n\nThe ICC board was given an update on the issues of USA Cricket during its quarterly meetings in Dubai last month. There is much at stake with the ICC for some time deeming the world's biggest sports market as cricket's number one growth country.\n\nThe U.S. is co-hosting next year's T20 World Cup with the West Indies in a landmark event hoped to continue momentum on the back of the MLC, which now appears set to start on time on July 13.\n\nThe 18-day tournament, consisting of 19 matches and six teams, will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas which has been earmarked as the hub for cricket in the U.S.\n\nMLC will spread to other cities in the future once infrastructure is finalized in a tournament hoped to light a fuse in a country long considered the sleeping giant for a bat and ball sport with a strong British footprint.\n\nInaugural franchises are from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas, Seattle, Washington DC and New York - strategic places with large numbers of South Asian expatriates and deemed growth areas for cricket.\n\nWith several franchises from money-spinner Indian Premier League staking a flag in potentially lucrative new terrain, MLC has secured more than $40 million in funding and over $100 million in “handshakes” with private investors including tech giants Microsoft MSFT .\n\nSalary caps were reportedly around $1 million per team with top players set to receive similar remuneration per game to cashed-up start-up leagues in the UAE and South Africa.\n\nEven though the competition was shrouded in uncertainty, a gaudy player draft was held last month in Houston with the first six marquee overseas signings announced.\n\nThe headliners were high-profile Australians Aaron Finch, Mitchell Marsh and Marcus Stoinis in the type of star power hoped to provide the tournament heft and credibility amongst cricket and American sports fans alike.\n\nWith MLC finally officially sanctioned, though dark shadows continue to linger amid volatile surroundings, there should be more marquee signings imminently as cricket's big moment in its coveted locale inches closer.",

    "date": "Thu Jul 20 10:00:07 2023",
    "body": "The first professional franchise cricket league in the United States launched this month. Curious Americans, don’t worry. The games won’t take days. There won’t be hours-long periods of play when nothing seems to happen. And no extended breaks when the teams disappear for “lunch” or “tea.”\n\nInstead, expect an action-packed type of cricket, with batters going for big hits from the outset and fielders throwing themselves around in an attempt to make catches or stop runs.\n\nMajor League Cricket in the U.S. is using the Twenty20 format, also known in the business as T20, one of the game’s shortest, quickest and newest versions.\n\nThink of it as cricket 2.0.\n\nWhile cricket still has its traditional test matches, which last up to five days and have no other restrictions on how long an innings can take, T20 is a limited-overs game and gives each team a set number of balls to get as many runs as it can.\n\nThe upshot is a far more exciting chase to get quick runs before your 20 overs are up. Those 20 overs translate as 120 balls, or deliveries, to hit. Each team gets one inning of 20 overs, hence the name Twenty20.\n\nMajor League Cricket is launching partly because the T20 World Cup featuring the world’s best international teams is set be co-hosted by the U.S. next year.\n\nWHEN DID TWENTY20 CRICKET START?\n\nT20 was first played at franchise level in England in 2003. That makes it a baby in terms of cricket, which has been played in one form or another for at least 400 years.\n\nWithin four years, T20 had its own World Cup and it has spawned franchise leagues in all the major cricketing countries, as well as some not so familiar with the game. There are lucrative T20 leagues in India, Pakistan, England, Australia and South Africa, of course, but also in newer cricketing territories such as the Middle East, Canada and the Netherlands.\n\nMajor League Cricket is the newest T20 league in the world and Americans the latest audience to get a taste.\n\nSPEED AND ENTERTAINMENT\n\nThe two important factors with the T20 format: It hurries the game up, meaning, generally, much more excitement. The game is also shortened time-wise and takes around three hours to complete, making it comparable to a baseball game and therefore easier to consume for young fans or those new to the sport.\n\nYou can watch a T20 game on a Friday night instead of having to give up your entire day for a one-day international or week to keep track of a test match like the Ashes.\n\nWhile the format leads to fast and furious action on the field, T20 has also sparked an evolution in off-field entertainment in cricket. Cheerleaders dancing on podiums, DJs sitting behind decks spinning tunes and fancy dress themes are all part of the T20 game, bringing a colorful new twist for supporters at the stadium and viewers on TV or online.\n\nCompetitions for fans at the game are also common to create a party atmosphere, like offering money for anyone who can make a one-handed catch when the ball sails into the crowd. Unlike baseball, though, the ball must be returned to the field.\n\nRULES\n\nCricket’s normal rules still apply in T20 games, meaning there might still be a steep learning curve for new fans unfamiliar with the leg before wicket law.\n\nAt least there will be no ties. Test cricket has two ways for a game to have no winner, even if it’s been going on for five days.\n\nBut in T20, if the teams get exactly the same number of runs — 150 runs is an average score and more than 200 a really good score — then there is a “Super Over” to decide the game. That means each team faces one over of six balls to smash as many runs as it can and whoever wins that tie-breaker wins the game.\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE CRICKET\n\nMajor League Cricket is up and running, having started last week. The tournament is being played at two venues, a former baseball park in Grand Prairie, Texas, and a cricket ground in Morrisville, North Carolina. There are six teams in the league, which has been in the pipeline since about 2018.\n\nThey are: MI New York, Los Angeles Knight Riders, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings and the Washington Freedom.\n\nLike most T20 competitions, Major League Cricket has also attracted international stars. Los Angeles has South African Rilee Rossouw and San Francisco has Australian Aaron Finch. They are both in the top 10 batters in the world in T20 internationals.\n\nRashid Khan of Afghanistan, the top-ranked T20 bowler, is on New York’s roster as is Kagiso Rabada, one of the best fast bowlers in world cricket.\n\n___",
    "summary": "**Launch and Format:** Major League Cricket, the first professional franchise cricket league in the United States, has launched this month, using the Twenty20 (T20) format, a shorter and more exciting version of the game.\n\n**T20 Format:** The T20 format, introduced in 2003, is a limited-overs game, where each team has 20 overs (120 balls) to score as many runs as possible. This format promotes fast-paced action and quick runs, making it more exciting and easier to consume for new fans.\n\n**League Details:** Major League Cricket features six teams: MI New York, Los Angeles Knight Riders, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, and the Washington Freedom. The tournament is being played at two venues in Texas and North Carolina. International stars, such as Rilee Rossouw, Aaron Finch, Rashid Khan, and Kagiso Rabada, are participating in the league.\n\n**Rules and Entertainment:** The rules of cricket still apply, with some modifications, such as the \"Super Over\" tie-breaker in case of a draw. The T20 format has also led to a more entertaining experience, with cheerleaders, DJs, and fan competitions, creating a party atmosphere at the stadium and on TV.",

    "body": "Did you know that cricket is the second most popular sport in the world? Second only to football (aka soccer), this sport with roots in 17th-century England has more than a billion fans worldwide and is especially popular in India and Pakistan.\n\nMany Americans aren’t familiar with the sport – but Major League Cricket is on a mission to change that. Although pro teams have played around the world for most of this century, professional major league cricket made its American debut this month with six teams – including plenty of international stars – playing a championship series in stadiums near Dallas, Texas, and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.\n\nOnce America’s national pastime – before baseball took over in the late 1800s – cricket may already be more popular on our shores than people realize, especially in Texas. Tickets sold out for most of the matches in the competition, including the final game on July 30 in Grand Prairie, Texas – and there are multiple amateur cricket pitches (fields) around the country, the largest of which is the Prairie View Cricket Complex, a 90-acre, 10-field facility northwest of Houston that has partnered with the nascent pro league to create the first MLC National Cricket Center.\n\nOn the MLC website, league co-founder Sameer Mehta says, “The passion fans have shown for Major League Cricket in Texas has demonstrated the bright future the game has in the United States … and this is only the start of a fantastic new era for American cricket.”\n\nNaturally, that new era calls for licensed fan merchandise, and the league’s online shop offers jerseys, T-shirts and caps for four of the six teams, with links to two more team shops on separate sites. Optamark Graphics (PPAI 714796, D3), a Connecticut-based distributor, has partnered with MLC to develop a full promo program that includes uniforms and fan apparel for the four teams selling on its site, as well as gameday giveaways for the league.\n\nFor example, fans attending the first match – in triple-digit heat – received a yellow promo flag for the home team, the Texas Super Kings, who won the match and signed the flags for eager fans.\n\nTarang Gosalia, CEO of Optamark and a self-described “passionate fan” of the sport, sees huge growth potential for cricket and says he’s excited to help the league and teams build their brands.\n\n“There seems to be a real fandom behind the sport, and we’re excited that we have this kind of deal in place with Major League Cricket now, not just now but for next season as well,” he says.\n\nIt was important to understand the larger context of the sport in order to develop the initial uniforms and promo offerings, Gosalia adds. The U.S. teams are representative of beloved India Premier League teams, which have huge online fan bases worldwide. The Texas Super Kings are affiliated with the Chennai Super Kings, for example, and their gear needed to reflect that connection.\n\n“They have their own brand standards, their own brand guidelines, their PMS colors from Pantone,” Gosalia says. “We worked with the creative teams at each individual sports franchise. We conceptualized what their current design aesthetic was, and then we created the concept design for the U.S. teams.”\n\nFour essential apparel pieces – jerseys, tees and hats – were selected and produced for the initial fan merch collection using the new team branding elements.\n\nOptamark also created bucket hats given to fans attending the games. Those hats and the flags have proved so popular that they will be added to the merch collections online, Gosalia says. He notes strong demand for apparel in children’s sizes, as well.\n\nOnline traffic and sales for the initial collection have been “tremendous,” Gosalia says, and a great deal stronger than expected. Texas Super Kings gear sold out halfway through the tournament, prompting a quick reorder for the playoffs, and Optamark will use data collected from the online shop, as well as what they’ve learned from in-person sales at the games, to adjust inventory and expand the product offerings.\n\n“We think there’s a lot of opportunity to build on this,” says Gosalia, “because they’re looking to expand with more and more teams within the league as this league continues to grow – and it’s only season No. 1.”",

The skipper of MINY led his team to victory with his awestruck 40 balls 100 en route to 137 off 55 deliveries in the final to chase down the 184 runs by 7 wickets and 24 balls to spare against Seattle Orcas.\n\nQuinton De Kock\n\nSwashbuckling Proteas batter, Quinton De Kock has been phenomenal and aggregated the 2nd most runs in Major League Cricket with 264 runs in 7 games. His runs have come at a fascinating strike rate of 151.72. In the final match of Seattle Orcas, De Kock went berserk against MI New York and hammered 87 off 52 balls to power his team to 183 in 20 overs, however, Pooran’s rampage innings overshadowed his innings and handed Orcas a 3 wickets defeat.\n\nHenrich Klassen\n\nHenrich Klassen was Seattle Orcas’s other important batsman in the latest edition of the event and occupies 3rd place on the list. Featuring 7 games, the middle-order batsman aggregated 235 runs, averaging a staggering 58.75 and striking at a stupendous rate of 197.47. He also smashed the first-ever century of MLC against MI New York, unbeaten 110 off 44 balls.\n\nDevon Conway\n\nStar Kiwi opener Devon Conway who also opens for the Chennai Super Kings in IPL, finds himself in 4th place on the chart of most runs in Major League Cricket, opening the batting for Los Angeles Super Kings.

    "date": "Wed Mar 22 21:31:41 2023",
    "body": "Summer is fast approaching, and fans of a popular sport involving balls and bats on a large field are getting ready for the action. But it’s not just baseball season this year. This July, Major League Cricket is set to debut in the U.S., and Texas has one of the first six teams.\n\nCricket is the second-most watched sport in the world, according to a press release from Major League Cricket. The sport has no shortage of fans in places like Europe, South Asia and Australia. So, why hasn’t it ever taken off in the U.S.? Is this the right moment to launch a professional cricket league in the States?\n\nTo discuss further, the Standard was joined by Tom Dunmore, vice president of marketing for Major League Cricket.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nTexas Standard: Tell us about the team that’s going to be based out of Grand Prairie. On Monday, they announced a team name, a coach and some players. What can you tell us?\n\nTom Dunmore: That’s right. They are the Texas Super Kings. That’s in partnership with the Chennai Super Kings, who are one of the top teams in the whole world, an Indian Premier League franchise. They’re bringing all their experience and making sure it’s world-class cricket that we’re playing here in Texas.\n\nThe exciting thing for the fans in Texas is not only do you have a team, but most of the games in the inaugural season of Major League Cricket will be played in Texas, near Dallas. The Grand Prairie Stadium is our first premier cricket-specific venue. So, there’ll be an opportunity to watch all of this happen live in Texas this summer starting on July 13th.\n\nCricket is not an unknown game here in the U.S. It’s been played for decades, but has Major League Cricket ever been tried before in the U.S.?\n\nNo, certainly not at this level. These are the best players in the world coming here: the top coaches, the top players. You know, it’s as if the best players in the world of soccer came to America in the summer to take part in a massive competition. Not only that – we’ll actually have the World Cup of cricket coming the following year in 2024, most likely with games at the stadium in Grand Prairie.\n\nIt’s really an unbelievable launch for the league. We’re taking a bit of a moonshot at this. It’s an ambitious venture, but we’ve got massive backing, and we know there are millions of cricket fans across America, including hundreds of thousands in Texas, which speaks to the diversity of Texas and the number of fans that there are, particularly in Dallas and Houston. We think this is the right time for the league to launch and take advantage of that audience for it.\n\nWhy do you think that cricket has failed to gain momentum in the past?\n\nYou know, it’s a long story. Cricket was once as popular as baseball. In fact, in the 19th century, it was played at a very high level here. In the Civil War, baseball kind of won the battles of the patent ball sports. At the time, it was a little easier to set up and play, particularly when troops were moving around and playing in different types of fields. Cricket takes a little bit more curation of the field. So, you know, baseball won out for 150 years or so.\n\nWe’re not trying to battle baseball. But we do think there’s a lot of fun with this new version of cricket that we’re playing called T20, which is really fast. It only takes about 2 1/2 hours for a match, similar to baseball. There are a lot of what you would call home runs in and big hits in T20 cricket. It’s a much faster, really athletic version of the game that’s taken off in popularity around the world.\n\nWe think it’s a great time to bring that to an American audience, particularly now that there are so many more cricket fans living in America because of the immigration over the last 20-25 years. It’s brought so many fans of the sport here. So, all those stars have aligned to launch this league now.\n\nWhat about the fact that a lot of Americans are a little unclear on the rules?\n\nThe rules take a bit of explaining, but there are definitely ways to do it. You know, I’ve seen some baseball fans do a great job of translating the terminology. My theory actually is the U.S. is a great place to launch a cricket league because Americans love bat and ball sports. A lot of the fundamentals are similar. It’s about hitting, scoring runs, catching outs – much that is very similar.\n\nEven if the wording is different, I think it would actually be harder to do this in Brazil or Argentina, where they love soccer but don’t love a bat and ball sport. So, I think we can translate it. I think we can win fans over. It might take a bit of time, but we’ve got the core fan base here already that loves the sport. We can introduce it gradually to the U.S. fans who aren’t familiar with it.\n\nI think once you see it in person and you see the adrenaline and the excitement and the fireworks and the big hitting, it feels really American as a sport. It’s got a lot of that dynamism to it. I think fans are going to love it once they get out to see a match.",

    "body": "MI New York won the first edition of the Major League Cricket. Here is the Overseas Team of the 2023 edition.\n\nA number of overseas stars stood out in the USA-based league, and we have picked the best overseas XI of MLC 2023.\n\nMatthew Wade (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\n168 runs @ 33.60, SR: 163.10\n\nWade’s powerplay strike rate of 188 was the highest among all openers in the season. Though he made only one fifty, he gave his team fiery starts throughout, the highlight being a 41-ball 78 against Los Angeles Knight Riders that propelled San Francisco to 212.\n\nQuinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas) – wicketkeeper\n\n264 runs @ 44, SR: 151.72\n\nApart from Wade, de Kock was the only opener to make 100 runs at a strike rate of 130 at the 2023 MLC, forcing us to go in with two left-handers at the top. While not at his best in the first six overs – he struck at 117 – he made up for it in the middle overs, scoring at 159. De Kock ended as the second-highest run-scorer in the league, topping his season with 87 in the final.\n\nNicholas Pooran (MI New York) – captain\n\n388 runs @ 64.66, SR: 167.24\n\nPooran’s unbeaten 137 in 55 balls in the final helped New York clinch the title, but he was as lethal in the group stage as well. He started with a 28-ball 40 in the opener and also struck two successive sixties and ended as the only player with more than 300 runs in the MLC.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen (Seattle Orcas)\n\n235 runs @ 58.75, SR: 197.47\n\nKlaasen had the best strike rate among all players in the league with 30 runs, and made one of two hundreds in the edition. He reached 25 four times, and had a strike rate of more than 190 thrice. His knock of 110 not out against New York was off 44 balls.\n\nAndre Russell (Los Angeles Knight Riders)\n\n206 runs @ 68.66, SR: 156.06\n\nLAKR finished last, but Russell was the lone performer as he often is with Knight Riders franchises around the world: no one else from the side made more than 135 runs. In the first game, LAKR were all out for 112, Russell top-scoring with a 34-ball 55. He then powered the side in their chase of 213 against San Francisco, and starred in their only win of the season, with an unbeaten 37-ball 70 against Washington Freedom.\n\nCorey Anderson (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\n190 runs @ 47.50, SR: 145.03\n\nThere was stiff competition for this spot, but Anderson edged ahead of Tim David for performing better under pressure. He started with an unbeaten 91 after his team had collapsed to 50-4, hitting seven sixes during his match-winning knock. His 20-ball 39 also proved to be a game-changer as the Knight Riders fell 21 runs short of the target of 213.\n\nShadab Khan (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\n127 runs @ 25.40, SR: 142.69\n\n5 wickets @ 31.20, ER: 9.17\n\nShadab was the only player to pick up five wickets and make 125 runs in the first MLC. He played a number of handy knocks throughout the season, including a 30-ball 61 in his team’s game against MI New York. He top-scored for San Francisco against Seattle with a 23-ball 37 and rose through the batting order to No.4 as the tournament progressed.\n\nImad Wasim (Seattle Orcas)\n\n10 wickets @ 15.30, ER: 6.33\n\nImad was the top wicket-taker among spinners in the tournament, and got a scalp every 14.50 deliveries. He picked up at least one wicket in every match that he played, including ending with two-fors thrice.\n\nRashid Khan (MI New York)\n\n8 wickets @ 20.50, ER: 6.83\n\nAdam Zampa had nine wickets at a better average, but we picked Rashid due to his heroics in the final against Seattle. In a high-scoring game, Rashid stood out for his spell of 3-9 in four overs, ending as the most economical bowler by a huge margin across both teams, establishing his class in high-octane clashes once again.\n\nTrent Boult (MI New York)\n\n22 wickets @ 10.36, ER: 7.39\n\nBoult picked twice the number of wickets as second-placed Cameron Gannon and Andrew Tye, and was miles ahead of the rest in the league. He finished with less than two wickets only once in eight games, and scalped three successive four-wicket hauls, and claimed 3-34 in the final, including the wicket of de Kock.\n\nAndrew Tye (Seattle Orcas)\n\n11 wickets @ 20.90, ER: 9.20\n\nThough Tye was expensive on occasions, he got the wickets, and ended with a strike rate of 13.63. He was the standout pacer in the team alongside Gannon and picked at least a wicket in his six games.",

    "date": "Fri Jul 14 20:22:13 2023",
    "body": "Major League League 2023 is the latest T20 league which has been launched by USA. The competition has attracted lots of cricket fans following the involvement of numerous international stats. However, the competition will operate without any official status and records achieved during the tournament will not reflect on the players career stats playing in the league.\n\nWhy is MLC 2023 not counted as an official T20 tournament?\n\nThe Major League Cricket has been sanctioned by USA cricket after their dispute with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the league organisers. When the country's official administrative body allowed the league to take place, the International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctioned the league as well. The approval by ICC allowed members to issue No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to their cricketers participating in the tournament.\n\nIf the league was not sanctioned by ICC, the tournament would have been termed as Disapproved Cricket, with members requested not to provide NOCs to their players.\n\nWhichever tournament is not approved following ICC's guidelines, is an unsanctioned league. Players who take part in these kind of tournaments face major consequences. The Indian Cricket League (2007 and 2009), was deemed as a \"rebel league\" with all players facing bans in other events.\n\nThe MLC lacks official legitimacy because it is taking place in the USA, an Associate nation. The MLC is still a valid competition despite its lack of official recognition. Simply said, it indicates that the players' tournament records won't be included in their career statistics.\n\nBoth the 2018 and 2019 Global T20 Canada events and this year's ILT20, which was hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a non-Full-Member nation, also lacked official status.\n\nComing back to MLC 2023, a total of six teams are playing in the tournament. The tournament kickstarts on July 14. The good news for Indian fans is that the league will be available to watch in India. There are going to be 19 matches played in this tournament for 18 days. Four of the six teams in this tournament are backed by IPL franchises.",
    "summary": "**Overview**: The Major League Cricket (MLC) 2023 is a T20 league launched in the USA, featuring international stars, but without official status.\n\n**Reason for non-official status**: The tournament lacks official legitimacy because it is taking place in the USA, an Associate nation, and not a Full Member nation.\n\n**Tournament details**:\n\n* The tournament starts on July 14 and will feature 6 teams playing 19 matches over 18 days.\n* Four teams are backed by IPL franchises.\n* The tournament will be available to watch in India.\n* The league has been sanctioned by USA Cricket and the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\n**Consequences of non-official status**: Records achieved during the tournament will not be reflected in players' career statistics.",

Other cricket investors include Iconic Ventures, Madrona Venture Group and executives from Google .\n\n\"What gets me excited is seeing if cricket can become a mainstream sport in the U.S.,\" said Soma Somasegar, venture capitalist and managing director at Madrona.\n\nSomasegar and Nadella are among the key owners of Seattle's cricket team, named the Orcas. They're also investors in the overall league.\n\n\"Satya [Nadella] and I have been talking about bringing cricket to America for many years,\" Somasegar told CNBC.\n\nNadella is such a die-hard cricket fan that Microsoft has a cricket field at its campus in Bellevue, Washington.\n\n\"A lot of us immigrants grew up with this sport. We'd study and watch cricket — on repeat,\" said Somasegar.\n\nIn total, nearly $850 million is currently in the process of being invested in building a viable cricket league in the U.S., people familiar with the funding said. The people asked not to be named because the funding information is private.\n\nCurrently, there are six professional teams in Major League Cricket, with each team expected to spend between roughly $75 million and $100 million over the coming years. That includes the cost of putting together a team, hiring the right talent and building stadiums where live cricket matches can be played.\n\nAdding to the fanfare is the T20 World Cup, which is being held at three locations in the U.S. and several in the West Indies throughout June.\n\nOn Thursday, in a stunning blow, the U.S. team beat Pakistan in a match held near Dallas. Fans are now counting down to the highly anticipated India vs. Pakistan match Sunday at the newly developed Nassau County stadium in New York.\n\nThe last time India and Pakistan matched up, more than 300 million people in India tuned in to watch the game, according to The New York Times.\n\nTicket reseller StubHub said the average price of tickets for Sunday's rivalry match is $1,300. The average price for the other 54 matches of the tournament is $120, the company said.\n\nVenture capitalist Anurag Jain, part owner of Major League Cricket team the San Francisco Unicorns, said the U.S. national team is primarily made up of players in the league.\n\n\"The goal is to make cricket a mainstream sport,\" said Satyan Gajwani, the vice chairman of Times Internet, the digital arm of the Times of India. He heads up Willow TV, which has the exclusive streaming rights for cricket in North America, including the T20 World Cup.\n\nGajwani is also one of the investors in the U.S. league. He said his group is going after the incredibly loyal fans from South Asia who live in the U.S.\n\n\"You essentially have five million really hard-core fans that love cricket,\" Gajwani told CNBC, referring to the South Asian diaspora in the U.S.\n\nHe added that expats from the U.K. and Australia who live in the U.S. are also big consumers of cricket.\n\nSouth Asians on average have the highest gross income of any ethnic group in the U.S., according to research from Indiaspora, a nonprofit community of Indian leaders around the world.\n\n\"That leaves a lot of discretionary income that is available to be spent on sports and entertainment,\" said M.R. Rangaswami, founder and chairman of Indiaspora.\n\nRangaswami, who said he will be at the match Sunday, acknowledged that the U.S. sports scene is tough to crack, with Americans consumed by basketball and football. He said a potential entry point could be through fans of baseball, which has some resemblance to cricket.\n\n— CNBC's Jessica Golden contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Seattle Orcas welcome former New Zealand pacer and one of the fastest bowlers to have played the game, Shane Bond as the club’s new bowling coach for Major League Cricket Season Two!\n\nWith former bowling coach Johan Botha taking up the Head Coach role at Queensland Cricket, he was no longer available during MLC Season 2. Pace ace Shane Bond was happy to be part of Seattle Orcas, and with his pedigree, there could be no better fit than the former Kiwi speedster.\n\nWith an experience of 120 international games including 18 Tests, 82 ODIs and 20 T20Is, Bond featured at the top level from 2001 to 2010. He was feared by a lot of batters around the world due to his threatening pace which helped him take 259 wickets in the internationals in which he featured.\n\nShane Bond started his coaching career as a bowling coach with the New Zealand cricket team in October 2012 and continued until the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup where the Kiwis finished runners-up. He was widely credited with shaping Trent Boult and Tim Southee to become the legendary bowlers they are. He has also been the bowling coach of the Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals franchises in the Indian Premier League. Bond also was the assistant coach for the Brisbane Heat in Big Bash League 2015, working with fellow Kiwi Daniel Vettori. In March 2018, he was appointed as head coach for Sydney Thunder.\n\nOn his new role with the Seattle Orcas, Bond said, “I’m excited to be a part of Major League Cricket and the Seattle Orcas. I’m looking forward to working with all the staff and players, especially the domestic players. The United States is a fantastic destination and to be able to be a part of a tournament that’s only going to get bigger and better is fantastic.”\n\n“Shane's a fantastic addition to the Seattle Orcas coaching team\", said Sanjay Parthasarathy, operating partner and co-owner of the Seattle Orcas. \"Shane's experience as a fast bowler, plus his recent coaching experience in the IPL will be an asset to our players and the coaching staff. I want to thank Johan Botha for setting a really high bar last year, and wish him the best as the head coach for Queensland and the Brisbane Heat,\" said Sanjay Parthasarathy, Owner of the Seattle Orcas.\n\nOur young and hungry bowling side is looking forward to being guided by our cool yet experienced bowling coach and it will be safe to say our group is in extremely good hands during MLC 2024!\n\nThank You, Johan Botha, for everything you have done for Seattle Orcas and its fans. Wishing you well in your new role. Welcome Shane Bond to Seattle Orcas.",

So it goes when Grand Prairie has become the epicenter of the world’s second-most popular sport and its attempt to conquer America.\n\nBut as impressive as Major League Cricket was in its debut season last summer, that only set the table for what kicked off—er, bowled off?—last weekend: the T-20 World Cup, otherwise known as the biggest cricket competition on Earth. North Texas is one of three American sites hosting matches, and as Kunwar Khuldune Shahid wrote last week, it could bolster the sport’s presence domestically better than any franchised league could hope to.\n\nThat hope burns brighter than ever after a moment like yesterday, when the United States upset Pakistan in Grand Prairie Stadium. For the uninitiated, Pakistan is cricket royalty, routinely vying with subcontinental rival India for dominance of the sport. The Americans? Uh, way less so. This is the United States’ first appearance in the competition. And yet, when both teams had completed their allotment of overs, the score was level. Enter the “super over”—cricket overtime—where the United States pulled away in no small part due to the heroics of Saurabh Netravalkar, an Oracle engineer by day. The Americans have now won both of their opening matches, which means all they need is one win over India (extremely unlikely) or Ireland (much more doable) to advance to the quarter-finals.\n\nBig things could be happening for American cricket, in other words. But even if the United States doesn’t advance, they’ve already won by creating a cricket moment that will be remembered for a long, long time. Think of yesterday’s five-run victory as something like the Miracle on Ice of cricket. And every time the highlights get played, Grand Prairie will forever be the setting. Pretty cool!",

    "body": "Steve Smith is reportedly considering a move to America to take part in a new T20 cricket league. Major League Cricket will hold its inaugural season this July, taking part in Texas and North Carolina over a three-week period.\n\nThe six-team league has been bankrolled by a number of heavyweights in India, with a reported AU$174 million invested by Microsoft boss Satya Nardella and Bollywood legend Shah Rukh Khan. Last week, Cricket NSW unveiled a partnership with Major League Cricket that will see American players come over to play in NSW Premier Cricket, and Aussies go the other way to play in the MLC.\n\n'UNUSUAL FOR HIM': Steve Smith's dressing room blow-up revealed\n\n'WHAT A JOKE': Cricket world rages at 'pathetic' Aussie women's farce\n\nCricket NSW has also entered into a partnership with the Washington DC franchise - one of six teams with a $1.5 million salary cap each season. The other teams are based in New York, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, with a number of IPL franchises engaging in similar partnerships with the US teams.\n\n“With the global cricket landscape currently undergoing significant transition, we view the United States as a market with immense growth potential,” Cricket NSW chief executive Lee Germon said last week. “Cricket NSW’s track record in high performance cricket and elite match operations is second to none and we believe we can bring a raft of experience to MLC and the Washington DC franchise in the coming years.”\n\nThe partnership will see Cricket NSW provide players and coaches to the Washington team, which could eventually include Smith. The talismanic Aussie batter won't play in the American T20 League this year due to the Ashes, but is reportedly weighing up a move to the States once he finishes his Test career.\n\nAccording to News Corp, Smith has been in talks with Major League Cricket bosses about making a cameo in 2024. The T20 World Cup will take place in the US and West Indies next year before the Major League Cricket season, opening a window for Smith to stay in the States and play.\n\n“We’ve been in touch with Steve about his plans and what he’s thinking,” MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta told News Corp. “What he’d love to do at some point is play cricket in the US as his schedule permits.\n\n“His view was that if he could make it work and if we could make it work – I know this season, he has commitments. I don’t know what the Australian calendar is next year but I believe there is enough space for him to potentially play.” Long-term … our view is that we might see a lot of him in the US.”\n\nSmith has a second home in New York and a connection to the Big Apple.

So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nAnd it might come sooner rather than later, with Smith revealing in January that he wasn't sure how much longer he wants to play Test cricket. \"We'll see. I'm enjoying it at the moment,\" he told reporters during the SCG Test. \"I really can't say how long I'll play for. I'm not sure.\n\n\"I'll take it one tour at a time, just enjoy it, enjoy training and trying to get better as well. Whilst I'm doing that, I'm happy playing but I don't know how long that'll last.\"\n\nHe later hosed down speculation he is on the verge of walking away from international cricket, but he's clearly thinking about what his future looks like.",

    "body": "The Knight Riders Group (KRG), backed by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside actor Juhi Chawla and businessman Jay Mehta, is investing in a 10,000-capacity cricket stadium near Los Angeles.\n\nLocated at a 15-acre land parcel in Great Park, Irvine, Southern California, some 40 miles from downtown Los Angeles, the plan is driven by Major League Cricket (MLC). The org has revealed that an exclusive negotiating agreement with the city of Irvine to move forward with lease negotiations and design approvals has been approved. The investment in the stadium is likely to be in the range of $30 million, Variety understands.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nBollywood Superstar Shah Rukh Khan Teams With Hitmaker Rajkumar Hirani for 'Dunki'\n\nShane Warne, Australian Cricket Legend, Dies at 52\n\nBBC Studios Sets Content Deal With India's MX Player - Global Bulletin\n\nKRG are owners of the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the lucrative Indian Premier League cricket tournament and Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nThe stadium, which will have the capacity to be expanded, will be designed by architects HKS and will be home to MLC’s Southern California-based franchise, in the heart of one of the largest cricket-loving populations in the U.S., including an estimated 100,000 cricket fans with a further 200,000 more located in Los Angeles County. Two Minor League Cricket teams, the SoCal Lashings and Hollywood Master Blasters, along with local adult and youth leagues in the area provide a base of grassroots support for cricket in the region.\n\nThe stadium plans include state-of-the-art training facilities, locker rooms, luxury suites, dedicated parking, concessions, field lighting and an international-grade pitch to meet International Cricket Council (ICC) accreditation. There are two major events that the proposed stadium, if completed in time, could host – the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2024, which will be co-hosted by the U.S. and the West Indies, and if cricket is included in the 2028 Olympic Games to be held in Los Angeles, which the ICC is bidding for. U.S.A Cricket is also expected to bid for future men’s and women’s World Cup tournaments.\n\n“Our investment in MLC in America is based on our belief in the exciting future of cricket in the U.S.A and is well aligned to our strategy of establishing Knight Riders as a global brand in T20 cricket,” said Khan, per an MLC press release. “Plans to build a world class cricket stadium in the greater Los Angeles area is exciting for us and MLC. This will no doubt have a transformational impact for cricket in one of the world’s most iconic metropolitan destinations.”\n\nSameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders, MLC, added: “Great Park’s position as a hub for community recreation and its array of first-class sports facilities makes it an ideal location for the addition of a venue serving the local cricket-loving community and the broader Greater Los Angeles region with major international cricket events set to take place there.”\n\nBest of Variety\n\nMolly Shannon's Memoir 'Hello Molly' Is Already an Instant Bestseller on Amazon\n\n2022 Primetime Emmys Awards Season Calendar: The Governors Balls are Back After Two Years\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney Plus in April 2022\n\nSign up for Variety’s Newsletter.

    "body": "Jones' 40-ball 94 was an eye-opener as his team notched a convincing seven-wicket victory over rivals Canada here, beginning the home team's campaign on a rousing note in a tournament they are hosting for the first time, along with the West Indies.\n\nJones, whose place in the T20I side was under scrutiny and was released by Major League Cricket franchise Seattle Orcas after its inaugural edition, said he showed he was \"good enough\" to play at the highest level. He was not picked in the last MLC draft.\n\n\"When I wasn't selected in the Major League, I just took it as a stepping stone in the journey,\" he said.\n\n\"I would have loved to get drafted, so it goes sometimes. Hopefully tonight's innings will probably open the eyes of those who don't know me or USA cricket.\n\n\"We have great players here and that we have a lot of talent here and are willing to play at the highest level for sure.\"\n\nSet a target of 195, USA stuttered initially, losing opener Steven Taylor for zero in the second ball of the innings, and were 42/2 after 6.3 overs.\n\nBut Jones had other ideas as he came up with a counter-attacking innings to script a memorable win with as many as 14 balls to spare.\n\n\"I don't think it is easy to put it into words. We know Canada come hard against us since it is a big rivalry. Happy to take the team over the line,\" said Jones.\n\nJones smashed 10 sixes on the day, the second most in a T20 World Cup innings behind West Indian Chris Gayle's 11 against England in 2016.\n\n\"Sometimes as a cricketer, you could go a bit under the radar if you have a few low scores,\" Jones said. \"I always back myself and know that I am capable of performing at every level. happy that I came out on top and won the game for USA.\n\n\"Hope it opens the eyes of some people around the world that I am good enough to play T20 cricket.\n\n\"I believe in myself, I work hard and I just use as motivation. I know that I'm good enough to play at the highest level, and whenever given the opportunity, I'll do my best for sure.\n\n\"When I went out to bat tonight, I just saw it as another game to fight for me and bring my team as close as possible to the line, and if we get as close as possible to the line and over the line, it's great for the team.\"\n\nDespite losing two early wickets, Jones said he was confident of chasing down the total with their long batting lineup. He got a helping hand from Andries Gous, who made 65 off 46 balls in a 131-run partnership with Jones.\n\n\"With our batting line-up, knew anything under 200 is chaseable. Outfield and pitch were good and we knew that,\" said Jones after USA's highest run chase in T20Is.\"\n\nUSA will next take on Pakistan at the same venue on Thursday and play India in ten days' time, while Canada face Ireland in New York on Friday.\n\nJones said they will continue to play fearless cricket.\n\n\"We just want to keep winning as much as possible, of course we can't win every single game for the rest of our lives.\n\n\"I don't think our plan is going to change much. We want to play fearless cricket, we want to play hard cricket, we want to play smart cricket.\n\n\"We are going into the Pakistan game with the same mindset. We want to play fearless cricket, regardless of who we play against.\"\n\nAll praise for Jones, USA skipper Monank Patel said: \"We've always known, he has the game. He played fearless cricket and backing his shots. It was clean hitting.\n\n\"We want to continue the way we are playing. Don't want to change our fearless cricket whether we play Pakistan or India.\"\n\nCalling it a team effort, Patel said: \"The way we've been playing against Canada in previous series, I thought it was a whole team effort.\"",

    "title": "Nosthush Kenjige: From dwelling in Bengaluru PG to star performer against Pakistan",
    "date": "Fri Jun  7 15:52:00 2024",
    "body": "Synopsis\n\nIn 2013, Nosthush Kenjige, disillusioned after failing to break into Karnataka's cricket scene despite rigorous training, returned to the US with a biotechnology degree. His passion for cricket reignited in New York, leading to his rise in the USA national team and impressive performances in Major League Cricket. Key to his journey was catching Dwayne Bravo's eye at the US Open T20. Kenjige now stars for the USA, notably taking crucial wickets in their stunning T20 World Cup victory over Pakistan.\n\nBack in 2013, Nosthush Kenjige shacked up in his PG room close to the CBD here, sulking. Then a 22-year-old, Kenjige was nowhere near fulfilling his dream of becoming a professional cricketer. A rigorous training at the Karnataka Institute of Cricket (KIOC) notwithstanding, Kenjige, one of the stars in USA's stunning win over Pakistan in the ongoing T20 World Cup, was not even close to breaking into the state cricketing eco-system.\n\nLatest from the Election Surpirse\n\nLok Sabha Elections: Track all the political movements Live\n\nThe fine print of Das & Co's first post poll policy\n\nShah, Nadda hash out deals with allies as Jun 9 looms\n\nFilled with disillusion, Kenjige, a US citizen by birth, returned to his mother nation armed with a degree in bio-technology from Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering.\n\nHis passion for cricket was not extinct but remained dormant as Kenjige explored a career in medical equipment inspection in New York.\n\n\"It was a phase I was merely floating around without much aim. But a year so later, I joined Columbia Cricket Club in NY, and that sort of reignited my desire to pursue cricket,\" said Kenjige, who was here on a personal visit a few months back.\n\nIrfan Sait, his early coach at the KIOC, said Kenjige made a timely return to the USA.\n\n\"He was talented for sure. He used to put in a lot of hard work at nets and played in the state league too. But as it happens here, thousands of cricketers want to break into the Karnataka state cricket team. Some will make it, some won't and Nosh, unfortunately, could not make it but that was no reflection of his talent or work ethics.\n\n\"When he decided to go back to the USA, I thought it was a good move and thought he may get to play at a higher level there,\" said Sait.\n\nIt was not a wrong assumption either. Kenjige rose through the ranks quite quickly in the next few years, earning a central contract with the USA national team and signed up for MI New York in the Major League Cricket.\n\nIn fact, the left-arm spinner was quite impressive for his side taking six wickets from as many matches at an outstanding economy rate of 5.76. His wickets included some top batters like Martin Guptill.\n\n\"The experience really helped me because it improved my confidence of standing up to bigger players and occasions,\" said Kenjige.\n\nBut there was a stroke of luck for Kenjige as former West Indian player Dwayne Bravo took notice of him at the US Open T20 tournament, an annual cricket exhibition event in Florida where some top cricketers from around the world participate.\n\nAli Khan, the USA teammate of Kenjige, too was picked by Bravo, who has an excellent eye for talent, during that tournament at the Cricketplex resort.\n\nSometimes minute moments can irrevocably change the course of someone's career or life and Kenjige admitted this as his turning point.\n\n\"I never thought that would change the whole course. It was a good spell but never thought that it would propel me into a bigger league.\n\n\"I had to do 800 hours of community service to be eligible to play for the USA, including teaching young cricketers, but all that effort was worth it when I made my national debut,\" said Kenjige.\n\nThe big day came in 2019 when Kenjige stepped on to the field against UAE, and since then he has played 40 ODIs and seven T20Is, including the one against Pakistan in New York on Thursday.\n\nKenjige grabbed the wickets of Usman Khan, Azam Khan and Shadab Khan to break Pakistan's charge in the middle overs.\n\nThe 33-year-old might have foreseen his glory day when he spoke about the need to exploit the chances.\n\n\"Coming from an Associate team, we don't often get chances to play against big teams. So, we need to ensure to grab those chances with both hands once they come our way. It's a tight situation but that's the challenging part for players like us,\" noted Kenjige, who was the USA's highest wicket-taker in the ICC Qualifiers last year.\n\nOne more challenge will come Kenjige's way on June 12 when USA face India, the country of his parents Pradeep and Keerthi.\n\n\"During those years (in Karnataka), I was ready to move away from cricket. But destiny has taken me to a different route, but one that I always wanted to travel,\" he signed off.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Sikkim Election Results News,Arunachal Pradesh Election Result News Election Results News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Sikkim Election Results News,Arunachal Pradesh Election Result News Election Results News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless",

    "body": "The USA had played the first international cricket match in history, back in 1844, but the sport had faded away after the First World War. Of late, however, there has been a conscious effort to make the sport popular in the nation again – through the Major League Cricket, the 2024 T20 World Cup, and a return of cricket in the Olympics after 128 years, in 2028 at Los Angeles.\n\nThe USA are co-hosting the 2024 T20 World Cup along with two-time champions West Indies. Eight matches, including the marquee India-Pakistan clash, will be played at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, while the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas and the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill will host four games each.\n\n“I’m unbelievably excited about going and watching a game in New York because I've just come back from the IPL where everybody is talking about you know the biggest game in cricket happening in New York,” said Eoin Morgan in conversation with Mel Farrell on the Wisden Cricket Weekly podcast.\n\nPart of the ICC commentary team at the World Cup, Morgan spoke about New York hosting a match featuring India and his former team, Ireland: “It’s going to be great to see India playing against the Men in Green, Ireland. I’m going to be there at that game as a fan, not as a commentator, and there are a few of my friends attending as well.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a great spectacle and a huge opportunity, when you think of the MLC last year being a success and sort of raising awareness about the opportunity that cricket could pose in the States.\n\n“You get a lot of people in England saying, ‘Well, do you think it will work?’ The answer is it’s already worked. I’m sorry, we’re already late to the party. When you have players having to choose between their home tournament and a tournament abroad, a player will always pick his home tournament if they you know if the opportunity is right. If the contract is right, there’s not one person that I’ve ever played cricket with that would turn down a big opportunity at home over something else.\"\n\nThe MLC's pull as a tournament is expanding. Former England opener Jason Roy will play there instead of the second half of the T20 Blast group stage (the English domestic T20 competition), while several high profile Australians are likely to compete in the second edition of the American franchise competition as well.\n\n“So, you have to give credit where credit is due. They’ve launched a good tournament [MLC] in the lead into this year’s World Cup. Over the last four months, we’ve seen social media reaction of the Nassau County international Cricket Stadium, which is just amazing. You really do get the impression following American sport in general that if they commit to something, they are all in. I get the feeling about that this World Cup is no different. So yeah, it will be brilliant.”",
    "summary": "* The MLC is a key factor in promoting cricket in the USA, along with the 2024 T20 World Cup and cricket's return to the Olympics in 2028.\n* The MLC has been successful in raising awareness about cricket in the States, with former England captain Eoin Morgan stating that \"it's already worked\".\n* The tournament's popularity is growing, with high-profile players like former England opener Jason Roy choosing to play in the MLC over the English domestic T20 competition, the T20 Blast.\n* Several Australian players are also likely to participate in the second edition of the MLC.\n* The success of the MLC is seen as a positive development for cricket in the USA, with Morgan praising the tournament's launch and the country's commitment to the sport.",

    "body": "Cricket is spreading its wings. Someone like the great Vivian Richards, the West Indian legend, had some years ago wished that this should happen after his experience of seeing the huge enthusiasm for the sport, particularly the T20 variety in the Gulf region. Now the big-time event in cricket, the T20 world cup has arrived in the USA which along with West Indies are hosting this marquee championship this time. Not that cricket is new to America, the Major League Cricket is there and indeed India and West Indies had played a few matches of their 2016 and 2023 T20 series there. But for a country which has hosted the Olympics multiple times and even the World Cup football (1994), this will be a first, a World Cup cricket on its soil. What better indication than that, thanks to the T20 version, cricket is truly becoming a global event if not still comparable yet to soccer. But the big march has begun. Indeed, the USA would look at this major championship as one more effort to strengthen the interest for this sport in the country and there is another reason. The 2028 edition of the Olympics is to be hosted by the USA and cricket (men and women) is one of the disciplines planned.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nThat much for USA’s interest and enthusiasm but for the cricket lovers around the world it is another occasion to delve into the thrills of the bat and ball that T20 always promises. The just concluded IPL, a hugely accepted event, perhaps world over, gave a sample of what cricket excitement can be all about. The venue now changes to a larger locale spread over two countries, one, the West Indies a traditionally big power in the sport. Picturesque settings are in place to match the high-quality cricket expected with around a third of the 55 matches scheduled in three cities in America. Twenty teams are in the fray including the three debutants, host USA, Canada and Uganda. All three gained acceptance by dint of their fine performances. USA, automatic entrant as host, had last month carved out a 2-1 win against Bangladesh in a T20 series, Canada in the warm up campaign had a significant win over Nepal while Uganda gained notice after finishing second in the T20 world cup Africa qualifier. What will be their influence on the big stage amidst the seasoned campaigners will be one area of curious interest for the cricket aficionados.\n\nWhatever flashes that the newcomers or lesser-known nations can throw up in the course of the championship it still becomes difficult to see anything beyond the fancied teams to make the super eight phase, where starts the true fight for supremacy. Here again, considering the way T20 can surprise and shock, there can never be a true prediction of who would lift the coveted Cup. Evidence of this can be seen in the way results had panned out from the time (2007) this Cup was instituted. Since the inaugural edition was held in South Africa, six teams had won the title with West Indies and England the only ones to lift the Cup twice each.\n\nAll said and done, close matches should be the feature with some big hitting the highlight. Already USA gave a glimpse of its capability with a convincing win over Canada in the championship opener. USA’s Aaron Jones must have been the toast of the home team supporters with his free-wheeling unbeaten 40-ball 94 that had ten hits over the fence! That probably sets the tone as every day from now on surely would promise many more spectacles of this kind and more. Perhaps the initial look out for fans would be the much publicised India-Pakistan encounter. An assured high voltage drama when the two face each other, this time too it should not any less. One thing it can be said with certainty there would be more eyeballs for this than perhaps any other contest!\n\nThis is not to put in the shade the abilities of the others like Australia, England, New zealand, West Indies, Sri Lanka and South Africa. India fans will in particular not forget what Australia can do having seen it grab the ODI world cup title in Ahmedabad last year. Having recorded ten straight wins before coming to the final, many had expected a home team triumph. The huge stadium was filled to capacity but in the end it was Travis Head who did the impossible, ensuring a grand victory for Australia and leaving the fans dumbstruck. Head who was a delight in the IPL will be there for more heroics. Not that India does not have its own heroes but the day’s performance that will be the key to everything around success. Still India has an additional pressure of being ranked number one even if history has not been too kind to it here. Except for winning the inaugural edition in 2007, India has hardly sparkled barring finishing runner up to Sri Lanka in 2014.\n\nMuch interest surrounds West Indies, considering the talents from this country have had good time in franchise cricket the world over. Besides, West Indies in the run up to the World cup had come up with a convincing 3-0 win over South Africa in a T20 series. That should have done the side a world of good in confidence. There is then much to look forward to even as the USA settles down to becoming an important centre for this sport in the seasons to come. Good for cricket, as they say.",

The initial 15 matches will be split between the two venues - Church Street Park and Grand Prairie Stadium. However, the final six group matches and the knockout fixtures will all be held at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas.\n\nThe teams will face each other once in the league phase, after which the top four sides will progress to the playoffs. The MLC 2024 final will take place at the Grand Prairie Stadium on 29th July.\n\nFour of the six MLC teams are owned by franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

A few more, like T20I captain Mitchell Marsh, are expected to join them soon.

According to the former English player, the Major League Cricket (MLC) has received funding of 100 million sterling pounds from private investors such as Microsoft and Adobe.\n\nQuote\n\nPlunkett’s words\n\nPlunkett, who recently signed a three-year deal with Minor League Cricket’s Philadelphians, said, “It’s go big or go home. That is how they do stuff in America. And with the money that is behind this, it is going to be massive. I think it will explode.” The pacer who represented England in 89 ODIs and 22 T20Is also added that the upcoming T20 league will attract legendary cricketers from every corner of the world.\n\nInformation\n\nCricket in the USA\n\nCricket is a fast-emerging sport in the United States of America. Next year, the country will host its first-ever domestic T20 league and in 2024, the States will co-host the ICC T20 World Cup along with West Indies. Shahrukh Khan-owned Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders have acquired one of the six franchises. The six teams will represent six cities, such as Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC.\n\nPlunkett, who shifted to the States last year after retiring from English cricket, also added, “Americans want to watch the best and I think we can attract them. I think they will definitely jump on board when they see how big it is. With how many people love cricket here and the way Americans put on a show, you will get packed-out crowds. Hopefully, you will get people like Jonny Bairstow, Andre Russell, and all of these guys coming across to play. It is a lot of people’s dream to play the sport in America.”\n\nAccording to a report, the MLC is constructing six venues that are in line with the standards of the International Cricket Council (ICC). “The first will open in Grand Prairie, Dallas County next year and will be the main venue for MLC’s inaugural season with a permanent capacity of up to 9,000, increased to 12,000 with temporary seating,” the report added.",

He brings a wealth of expertise to the group, and I’m looking forward to leaning on him as a mentor when it comes to game strategy and leadership.”\n\n“After experiencing the inaugural MLC season, I have high expectations for 2024 both on and off the pitch, and will be fully focused on delivering success to the growing Unicorns fanbase – once I’ve done all I can to take the USA as far as I can in the current T20 World Cup.”\n\nThe former multi-format representative for New Zealand has made a name for himself with a powerful striking style that once saw Anderson hold the record for fastest ODI hundred in just 36 balls. He has since gone on to earn 38 International T20 caps, averaging 26.41 with a strike rate over 130, and represent various T20 franchises including the IPL’s Royal Challengers Bangalore and Big Bash League’s Hobart Hurricanes.\n\nShane Watson, Head Coach of the San Francisco Unicorns, added: “Corey has been pivotal in shaping this franchise’s DNA since the inaugural season last year. He is a natural leader on and off the field and has an immense amount of experience at the highest level, which translates perfectly into leading the San Francisco Unicorn’s this season.\n\n“I am super excited about building a very successful coach-captain relationship with him.”\n\nPat Cummins, Australia Test and ODI Captain and recent Unicorns signing, said: “The culture of the Unicorns group, put into place by the likes of Corey and Shane, is one of the reasons why I’m here. As a USA international and fan favorite, he’s a deserving captain and I can’t wait to play for him and the rest of the team in July.”\n\nCorey Anderson will lead the Unicorns out in his first match as captain against the LA Knight Riders on July 7, 2024, at the Grand Prairie Stadium, near Dallas, TX – the same venue that saw USA edge out Pakistan – featuring a team packed full of global superstars, including recent signing Pat Cummins, NZ batter Finn Allen, and Pakistani pace bowler Haris Rauf.",

    "body": "The BCCI should use the American Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise to give talented but unproven young players the chance to hone their skills in foreign conditions\n\nAmericans are not fans of cricket. They do not understand it and see it as slow, complicated (how do you score again?), and somewhat effete (so what is it with the preppy sweaters). So the game has been confined to purely amateur cricket leagues in cities as far flung as Los Angeles, Birmingham Alabama, and of course New York. Yet America is a globalized nation with large Diasporas from the cricket playing world. Also, the clever marketing of the International Cricket Conference (ICC) has led to the creation of a domestic T20 League that is backed by wealthy Indians like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and has teams owned by franchises in the IPL as well as a team owned by the Australians. While this is promising, the question is can the league succeed and the answer is an unqualified yes! There are several reasons for this.\n\nFirst, the success of cricket lies in the fact that the Indian diaspora, much like the nation of India, could drive it to being a financial success. The cricket crazy Indian diaspora has the highest median household income of $126,000 in the USA while the median American household income is $74,580. This gives the Indian diaspora both purchasing power and consuming power and this used to be reflected in the way Bollywood stars were generously feted in the USA or in the way Narendrabhai Modi was greeted in the lavish Howdy Modi event. Indians have never had a sporting event to call their own but with the T20 league they do.\n\nThey are also good at organization. In Toronto, the Indians took over the local city league from the West Indians—who ran it as a social event—and professionalized it to the extent that Canada now has a team in the T20 World Cup. The Indian diaspora will effectively market the matches, make sure facilities are up to par, and provide both the players and the local fan base to support the game. Players like Saurabh Netravalkar, who works at Oracle and moonlights as a cricketer for the USA, are good examples of the ability to bring in local talent.\n\nSecondly, cricket will never be the multi-million Dollar sport American football, baseball, and basketball are but it could provide a semi-amateurish wage potential for players who are most likely playing for the love of the game. In this sense, Major League Soccer (MLS) is instructive since the lowest salaries in the league are around $60,000, a far cry from the multi-million Dollar packages athletes in the traditionally “American” sports receive. Yet, despite the lower wages, soccer is now wildly popular in the US and games are played to packed stadiums.\n\nA league that starts off modestly and systematically builds up a fan base and local traditions—where fans support their city team much in the way an older generation of Indians supported Mumbai, Delhi, and Karnataka—has a good chance of happening. But what will primarily drive the success of the new league is the ability to bring in marquee players who have name recognition across the cricketing world. Again the MLS is the guide for this because it brought in aging stars like Kaka, Thierry Henry, David Beckham, Wayne Rooney, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic to boost attendances. Henry, Beckham, and Ibrahimovic in the off-season continued to play for premier European clubs. Thus aging draws like Chris Gayle and Andre Russell would boost attendance and viewership in the US. But the most important tool for success will be the cooperation of the BCCI.\n\nThe BCCI has jealously guarded its properties and the value of the IPL by not allowing marquee Indian players like Kohli, Bumrah, and Sharma to play in foreign leagues like the Australian Big Bash. But sending second tier players and even famous retired players to play in the US would be a great hit with the crowds and jump start the league. If, for example, Mahendra Singh Dhoni finally retires from the IPL, he would be a hugely popular draw playing for the Texas Super Knights who are partly owned by the Chennai Super Kings. And if the way Sachin Tendulkar was mobbed by adoring fans at the India-Pakistan game in New York is any indication, Mumbai Indians should ask the great man to play a few games for their New York franchise (for the record, Sachin, while long retired, would still be among the best players in the league).\n\nTo put this in perspective, MLS brought in Lionel Messi and it was a masterstroke for all the games he plays in are sold out and you cannot buy a ticket under $200. Tendulkar, Dhoni, Sehwag (if interested) would draw large crowds and seal the future of the game. Nor do they need to play for the entire season but, instead, show up for a few games to whet the appetite of the fans.\n\nFurther, the BCCI should use the American Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise to give talented but unproven young players the chance to hone their skills in foreign conditions. Bob Woolmer used to say that South Asian cricketers are flat track bullies who do not perform as well in foreign conditions. While not strictly true, the fact remains that both Indian bowlers and batsmen could benefit from playing in different conditions and on a tricky wicket like the one in New York. Sending maybe two young cricketers to each team in the MLC would both help the league and improve the skills of these players.\n\nTo sum up, this is a great chance to bring the game to the US, provide joy to cricket crazy fans, and to create a sporting league that is integrated into the IPL. Moreover, the advertising opportunities for Indian firms cannot be overlooked since this would be a cheap venue and way to attract eyeballs in the United States. Put simply, this is not an opportunity to pass up.\n\n(Amit Gupta is a Senior Advisor on Peace and Conflict Resolution to the Forum of Federations, Ottawa.

    "body": "As administrator Justin Geale assessed the arrival of a jewel of world cricket to the USA, he declared “the train has left” Grand Central Station when it comes to establishing the sport in the United States.\n\nThe Canberra-born Geale is the tournament director for Major League Cricket, which was granted List A status by the International Cricket Council in May, and is among the Australians featuring heavily in the expansion of the sport across America.\n\nAn historic summer in the US, which will host a World Cup for the first time in conjunction with the West Indies, is a significant step forward in what shapes as an important decade for cricket in America — a nation that already boasts a rich and eventful cricketing history.\n\nWatch selected NRL & AFL games, along with every F1 race live in 4K on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial today\n\nSTAR IS BORN: New York-born hero powers USA to historic opening win\n\n‘MUST BE BETTER’: Fallen giants in massive World Cup scare as minnows announce arrival\n\nThe USA will host 16 of the 55 matches in the T20 World Cup ahead of the second edition of MLC — featuring Australians Steve Smith, Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell — which runs throughout July and involves six franchises across the country.\n\nAs important as hosting a World Cup is, the biggest step forward for cricket in the US is its inclusion in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, according to Geale.\n\n“The LA28 Olympics is going to be huge for cricket. For the first time, what that does is open up different funding avenues in terms of America, so there are great opportunities there,” he told foxsports.com.au.\n\n“It’s no surprise we’ve got a franchise base (in Los Angeles). That’s a key market for us to get going, because they’re going to play cricket at the Olympics.\n\n“I think it’s all going to happen together over here. The MLC is really important. The minor leagues are important. The US national team is getting stronger and being competitive, which is really important.\n\n“The bigger play here, though, is to make cricket a more mainstream sport is to get into colleges and high schools. It’s a phenomenal setup here in terms of high school and college sports.\n\n“(But) that’s a much longer term play and that’s going to take all main stakeholders from the ICC, USA Cricket and the MLC pulling together.\n\n“But I think that momentum, if you look at the successful MLC launch last year (and hopefully) a strong follow up season on the back of a World Cup, and the US getting stronger into LA28, I think it shows that cricket can work here.”\n\nCRICKET? IN AMERICA? WHY HISTORY SUGGESTS THE WHITE BALL GAME CAN FLOURISH IN THE USA\n\n“A tiger? In Africa?”\n\nThe Monty Python quote sprang to mind when the location of this year’s T20 World Cup was confirmed by the ICC in November, 2021.\n\n“A Cricket World Cup? In America?”\n\nThe tournament serves as a litmus test — America has been earmarked as one of cricket’s growing markets due to its financial power and thriving South Asian immigrant community.\n\nIt is hoped the World Cup will broaden awareness and have a similar impact to what was achieved with soccer in America following the FIFA World Cup in 1994.\n\nThe ICC estimates there are around 30 million cricket fans in the US and the organisation is embarking on a mission to rebuild the sport to mainstream status in a country it considers a sleeping giant.\n\nCricket Victoria’s chief executive Nick Cummins noted the prospective fanbase in the US after his state affiliated with the San Francisco Unicorns ahead of the MLC launch last year.\n\n“It’s not something you would expect to say about America, but there is a significant cricket-supporting population in the country,” he said last year.\n\n“If we just focus on the Bay Area with the Unicorns, there are about 500,000 South Asians interested in cricket just in the Bay Area – so that’s Tasmania. So you’ve got a potential cricket fan base of Tasmania in just one city.”\n\nIt is a point made by Geale, whose organisation is looking to expand the number of cricket venues across the US for a competition currently hosted at grounds in Texas and North Carolina.\n\n“We don’t shy away from the fact that we have an existing fan base here which is really massive by world standards,” he said.\n\n“That is first or second generation (and) there is a strong Indian, Pakistan, Afghani and Sri Lankan population. We break down to an Australian, English, West Indian population on the East Coast.\n\n“The expat market is huge. It’s a very well educated market over here, particularly in the Asian markets, because they have come here to go to college, or their parents have come here, and they are second or third generation now. So we have that fan base already.\n\n“We need to tap into that properly and not shy away from that. So if you come to a ground, you will get a samosa, but you’re also going to get a hot dog as well. The bigger play is to make it more mainstream.\n\n“Do we need to be Major League Baseball? No, absolutely not. But they’re constantly looking at what we’re doing and trying to make sure we’re not stepping on their toes, though I think it’s a big enough market for all of us, to be honest.”\n\nREBUILD CRICKET TO MAINSTREAM STATUS? THE SPORT PREDATES THE ASHES IN THE US.\n\nCricket was one of America’s first outdoor team sports, with archived references to it being played in the United States from 1709.\n\nGeorge Washington’s troops are said to have played a version of the game at Valley Forge during the American Revolution in 1778, while Benjamin Franklin owned a copy of the 1744 Laws of Cricket.\n\nAs cricket spread across the globe via the British Empire, embedding itself into the national identity of Australia and India, the sport also became a popular pastime in the US, with nearly 1000 cricket clubs across 22 states during the 19th century.\n\nThe first international cricket match was played between the USA and Canada in Manhattan in 1844, more than three decades before Australia’s first Test match against England, and is reported to have drawn 10,000 fans.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln reportedly attended a match between Chicago and Milwaukee in 1849, while the Philadelphia Cricket Club had first-class status between 1874 and 1913 and rivalled some of the world’s best teams during the late 19th century.\n\nBut perhaps it is best that some history is left unknown, for the club defeated Australia three times through this period.\n\nCricket’s golden age in America came to an abrupt end when the Civil War started in 1861, with baseball becoming entrenched in the national identity.\n\nAmerican cricket went into a seemingly irreversible decline over the coming decades, fading into obscurity following the world wars.\n\nThe sport’s popularity grew marginally after the United States was admitted to the ICC as an associate member in 1965, but cricket remained relatively unknown until the turn of the millennium, with about 30,000 people playing or watching cricket in America.\n\nCourtesy of the mass influx of immigrants from cricket-obsessed South Asian nations such as India and Pakistan, that figure has since ballooned to more than 200,000.\n\nAmerica’s South Asian population has increased exponentially from 3.4 million in 2010 to 5.4 million in 2023, while the Indian diaspora in the United States is among the wealthiest of any migrant community.\n\nMeanwhile, North America is already the third-largest television market for cricket behind India and the United Kingdom.\n\nA WHITE BALL FUTURE FOR THE STARS AND STRIPES\n\nThe 2024 T20 World Cup is cricket’s latest attempt to push into the largely-untapped American market but it is not the sport’s first attempt to win over the US.\n\nA prototype of T20 cricket called One Season was played in America in 2004 before West Indies legends greats Clive Lloyd and Desmond Haynes launched an early edition of Major League Cricket the following year. Both competitions folded and faded into insignificance.\n\nA decade later, cricket icons Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar hosted a series of exhibition matches across the United States, recruiting former teammates for games in diamond-shaped baseball stadiums. It drew the attention of expats from South Asia and the Caribbean, but failed to capture the attention of the wider American public.\n\nThe US didn’t have the multipurpose facilities required to host an international-quality cricket tournament, partly due to well-documented governance issues between USA Cricket and the ICC.\n\nHowever, the sport’s recent privatisation paved the way for the development of purpose-built cricket stadiums across the country.\n\nIn 2019, American Cricket Enterprises received exclusive sanctioning rights to set up a T20 league in the United States, pledging to invest in local cricket pathway tournaments and help fund cricket stadiums nationwide.\n\nThe deal meant more than $US 1 billion would be invested into the development of domestic US cricket and a couple of years later, the organisation announced the inaugural season of its new T20 tournament — Major League Cricket, the most ambitious attempt yet to establish professional cricket in the US and a competition being steered in part by Geale.\n\nBankrolled by four Indian Premier League franchises and leading Indian-American tech executives, including the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan, MLC quickly became one of the wealthiest T20 tournaments in the world, receiving investments that exceeded AU$174 million.\n\nCricket NSW and Cricket Victoria also joined the venture, signing on as operational partners for two of the competition’s six franchises.\n\nMLC’s inaugural season was played across three weeks at Texas’ Grand Prairie Stadium and North Carolina’s Church Street Park in 2023.\n\nEach of the six franchises — based in Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Seattle and New York City — were given a $1.5 million salary cap to secure 18 players, including seven overseas stars.\n\nThe roster included former Australian captain Aaron Finch, World Cup champion Adam Zampa, T20 globetrotter Tim David, West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell, New Zealand quick Trent Boult and South African prodigy Dewald Brevis.\n\nThe 2023 season surpassed financial expectations, with most of the 19 matches selling out.\n\nMLC has already secured the services of Smith, Head and Maxwell for an expanded 2024 campaign, along with Ricky Ponting as a head coach, while plans are in motion to build more stadiums and infrastructure over the coming years.\n\n“When I came to Seattle in 1989, there weren’t any cricket teams,” Soma Somasegar, co-owner of the Seattle Orcas, told The Athletic.\n\n“Today, there are about 250 to 300 cricket teams in Seattle spread across multiple leagues. That grassroots energy and excitement is true, not just in Seattle but in a lot of cities in the country.\n\n“We’re trying to think for the long term. Attracting the stars is part of how we start; using what they do to penetrate school and college environments to help people see cricket is interesting. Our dream is that kids can see that and then grow up here to play at college or professionally.”\n\nHead, for his part, is excited to be heading to the US to represent the Washington Freedom.\n\n“I just wanted an opportunity to see what that circuit looked like. It is going to be nice to be in the States after the World Cup,” he told foxsports.com.au.\n\n“It is important to have a little bit of a spell before we go to England for those one-dayers and I have to try to prioritise a little bit of rest at some point.\n\n“But to get my first look at T20 franchise cricket, I’m early in the scheme of things in terms of the IPL and there is still a lot of touring to go, but I am enjoying it. It is good. It is fun.\n\n“I feel like I am at the right stage of my career to be able to prioritise all three formats, which is nice. It is a nice feeling from my end.”\n\nHIGH HOPES FOR THE MLC POST THE WORLD CUP\n\nThe 2024 MLC season kicks off four days after the T20 World Cup final and is aiming to capitalise off the buzz generated from the marquee tournament.\n\nThe T20 World Cup will have legitimate cricket fields with drop-in pitches and temporary grandstands, including a $30 million venue in New York that will host the blockbuster match between India and Pakistan.\n\nCurrently, ticket prices for the event range from $2,000 to $22,000, but those prices are expected to leap further closer to the game.\n\nThe 34,000-seat modular Nassau County Stadium, located in a repurposed public park about 50 kilometres east of Manhattan, has finished construction just in time for the event.\n\nA drop-in pitch was grown in the temperate subtropics of Florida and transported in sections across a 2000-kilometre journey along America’s east coast.\n\nGeale believes the wicket for the MLC-operated venue in Dallas, which hosted the opening match of the tournament between the USA and Canada, is world class.\n\n“It has taken four years to get this stadium up in Dallas and the head curator, who is from Adelaide, has done an amazing job,” he said.\n\n“It really is a world class wicket and we can’t wait for the world to see that with the World Cup and with the best players,(which) means that we can showcase the game the best it can be.”\n\nThe T20 World Cup will be competing for airtime alongside the NBA Finals and Major League Baseball, but there otherwise aren’t any major sporting events happening in the United States in June.\n\nThe window in July used for the MLC is also favourable in terms of the international calendar, with the only competition The Hundred in England during July.\n\nCricket has thrown everything it has got at the United States.\n\nThe next decade will provide a gauge as to whether the sleeping giant has awoken and has the muscles to become a power.",
    "summary": "* The Major League Cricket (MLC) tournament is set to take place in the United States, with the second edition of the tournament running throughout July.\n* The tournament has been granted List A status by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n* The MLC features six franchises across the country, with Australian cricketers Steve Smith, Travis Head, and Glenn Maxwell set to participate in the tournament.\n* The tournament director, Justin Geale, believes that the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles will be a significant step forward for cricket in America, as it will open up different funding avenues.\n* The MLC is part of a larger effort to make cricket a more mainstream sport in the US, with plans to expand the number of cricket venues across the country.\n* The tournament aims to tap into the existing cricket fan base in the US, which is estimated to be around 30 million cricket fans.\n* The 2023 season of the MLC surpassed financial expectations, with most of the 19 matches selling out.\n* The 2024 season is expected to be even bigger, with plans to build more stadiums and infrastructure over the coming years.\n\nOverall, the article suggests that cricket is on the rise in the US, with the MLC tournament playing a key role in promoting the sport and increasing its popularity.",

Cummins will be the next big signee in the league following fellow Aussies Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith and Jake Fraser Mcgurk.\n\nAs per a report in Cricbuzz, Cummins is set to feature for San Francisco Unicorns in the upcoming MLC and will likely be Aaron Finch's successor after the latter's retirement. He will join fellow Aussies Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk, both of who have signed for the team.\n\nThis tournament will extend Cummins' gruelling cricket schedule, which began in February with Australia's tour of New Zealand. He recently led Sunrisers Hyderabad into the final of IPL 2024 in his maiden stint as T20 captain. Cummins's SRH fell short on the final hurdle, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders in a lop-sided showdown clash last week.\n\nDespite the loss, Cummins' credentials as captain speaks volumes due to his achievements on the International circuit. He has led Australia to the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup victories in 2023. He also led the Aussie team to retain the Ashes in England with a 2-2 draw in a five-match series last year.\n\nThe upcoming MLC will begin on July 5, five days after the T20 World Cup in the Americas. The league recently got the List-A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC), becoming the second Associate-run franchise competition to get this status. The first one to get the List-A status was UAE's ILT20.\n\nThe second edition of the tournament will commence from 5 with defending champions MI New York taking on runners-up Seattle Orcas at the Church Street Park in Morrisville.

Cricket has been on the rise in the USA over the past couple of years. The Major League Cricket (MLC) has played a crucial hand in the growth of cricket in the country. Recently MLC became the second Associate Franchise Tournament after the United Arab Emirates' International League T20 to acquire List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\nThe fever of cricket has seen an influx of interest in the USA as the T20 World Cup is just on the verge of commencing. Ahead of the tournament, while talking about the sport's growth in the USA, Kohli stated he never expected to play any cricket format in the USA.\n\n\"Honestly, I never thought that we would be playing cricket in any form in the States. But now it's a reality. That tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world. The United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first one on a global scale to accept it in a way with the World Cup, which is I think it's a great start. It's the ideal way to begin. So I think it's going to have a huge impact,\" Kohli said in a video posted by the U.S. Consulate Mumbai on X.\n\nMLC's debut season in 2023 transformed the landscape of American cricket, bringing world-class domestic T20 action to the United States for the first time with most of the matches played in front of sold-out crowds in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nAfter a successful end of the inaugural season of MLC, the second season will feature top stars from the cricket giants.\n\nKohli talked about the influence of MLC and its potential in developing interest in cricket among the fans and added, \"In starting off a kind of a domino effect and I hope that it carries on for a long period of time. We have enough people as I said from our regions to keep the game up and alive in the States and make the others more aware about what it feels like to play cricket and watch cricket. I think it's got great potential with the MLC as well. There's already franchise cricket happening there. So I think it's moving in the right direction.\"\n\nWashington Freedom will be Australian-stacked in the upcoming season. Top players like Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, and coach Ricky Ponting will feature for the franchise.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns will be bolstered by hard-hitting opening New Zealand batter Finn Allen.

    "body": "The league is also planning to expand from the current six teams to 10 in the coming seasons\n\nESPNcricinfo staff\n\n27-May-2024\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC), the season-old T20 tournament in the USA, has become the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire List A status from the ICC, following on from the UAE's ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThe status means that MLC will now be recognised as an official T20 league, with tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics. \"We are really excited for the news as it's a recognition of the standard and high quality of players taking part in the tournament,\" tournament director Justin Geale told ESPNcricinfo. \"By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale.\n\n\"The most important part for me though is it ensures the performances of some of the world's best players alongside their peers are adequately reflected in their career statistics.\n\n\"Really thankful to the ICC for taking the time to look at it as cricket in the USA doesn't always fit into a template. We are an Associate nation and proud of that, one with a unique opportunity in front of us. It's our hope that on the back of the upcoming World Cup and a successful season we can continue to build a platform for the sport to grow and ultimately succeed in the USA.\"\n\nThe 2024 edition of MLC will start on July 5, a week after the T20 World Cup ends on June 29 in Bridgetown. The T20 World Cup begins, however, in Dallas, USA on June 1, in what is an important season in the game's continuing efforts to crack the US market.\n\nThe Guardian, which reported on the awarding of List A status on Monday, also revealed MLC's plans to expand from the current six teams to 10 over the next few years, jumping from 19 games in 2023 to 34 by 2025. Twenty-five games have already been scheduled for this season.\n\n\"It was always intended to be a 10-team league,\" MLC's chief executive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the Guardian. \"Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that's our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.\"\n\nSrinivasan said they wanted the league, which clashes with the Hundred in 2024, to start in early June in 2025.\n\n\"Ultimately for us, our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,\" Srinivasan said. \"With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That's how we would like to establish our window.\"\n\nAn early June start avoids a clash with the Hundred's July-August window, but it could mean an overlap with the T20 Blast. This scheduling clash became a major talking point in the last English summer when Jason Roy opted out of his ECB contract to play in the MLC and went on to represent LA Knight Riders, who have the same owners as that of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), who won their third IPL title on Sunday.\n\nLast year, MLC ended two days before the start of the Hundred, though this time there will be an overlap of six days between the two leagues, with the MLC ending on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. As a result, as many as half of the overseas players in the Hundred could arrive in the UK late after the MLC ends. Twelve out of the 24 overseas players under contract in the men's Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in MLC and more could follow before the tournament starts.\n\nFour of the six teams in the MLC are owned by IPL team owners - Mumbai Indians, KKR, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals.\n\nThe first season ran from July 13 to 31 with 15 group-stage games followed by four playoff matches, and ended with MI New York lifting the trophy under the captaincy of Nicholas Pooran. The second season will be played across the same two grounds which hosted the first season - the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and the Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.",

    "body": "Had the driver been one of the curious American-born spectators who ventured inside the venue and witnessed the USA's first ever T20 World Cup game -- a pulsating seven-wicket victory over Canada -- he would have had the answer.\n\nYes, team game it is, but in the shortest form it is also one that can be largely won by the brilliance of an individual.\n\nFor the USA's maiden victory, in front of a passionate crowd inside the purpose built, 7,000 capacity home of Major League Cricket, that individual was Aaron Jones.\n\nJones' unbeaten 94 of 40 balls, featuring 14 boundaries, ten of them sixes, with the stadium PA blasting out Miley Cyrus's \"Party in the USA\" after the biggest hits, transformed what could have been a very low key American debut in elite cricket into a spectacular celebration.\n\n\"Especially because America is not really a 'cricketing country'. I wanted to win the first game of the tournament for our fans and we did that,\" a smiling Jones said after the game.\n\nNow the USA must prepare for a much bigger test of their credentials in the sport's elite, when they take on Pakistan, at the same venue, on Thursday.\n\nConverting Americans?\n\nBut there is a bigger context to this tournament for the co-hosts because as much as organiser's play down the attempt to convert American sports fans to the pleasures of the old game, part of the whole idea of holding the biennial tournament in the USA is to establish some firmer roots for the sport here.\n\nThere were two things to note about the crowd at Grand Prairie -- as expected the majority of spectators were drawn from the Indian community in Texas but as they showed throughout, they are fervent backers of the national team of their adopted country.\n\nEvery one of New York born but Barbados-raised Jones' sixes was greeted with a massive roar and the final one, to seal victory, set off wild celebrations in the stands.\n\nThe second element was that, scattered among those Indian-heritage fans were local Americans who have, to a greater or lesser degree, been won over by the game.\n\nSean Fortner, who drove three hours from Houston with his family and friends, was attending his first ever match but said he had watched many games on television after studying Indian society and culture at University.\n\n\"I watched it for a long time, trying to figure it all out,\" he told AFP, \"Finally I got one of my Indian friends to explain all the rules to me and I just got hooked on it\".\n\nSo much so that Fortner even made a seven-minute video explainer that he shared with his companions before they made the trip to the game.\n\nAnother Texan first-time fan Ryan Ubl from Dallas, was also at his first game.\n\n\"I got into it really during the ODI World Cup in India. I worked with a bunch of people from India and they were very enthusiastic about it all and so I watched a bit of it and tickets weren't so expensive, so here I am,\" he said.\n\nUbl is a baseball fan and knows there are limits to how far cricket could go in the USA but thinks there is a future beyond this tournament.\n\n\"Obviously I don't think it'll ever eclipse baseball but it could carve out its own little niche,\" he said.\n\nFortner agrees even if he knows the sporting mainstream remains far away.\n\n\"Just watching how hard it has been for soccer to get a (foothold) when half the people that live here love soccer already, it's a hard hill to climb. But it can catch on, we know fandom and we get loyal,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not going to get a lot of fans but we'll get loyal fans,\" he said.\n\nJones, still buzzing from his spectacular innings was understandably in no mood for measured considerations even with Pakistan and top-ranked India to come.\n\nHis accent may be Bajan but the attitude and rhetoric was all-American.\n\n\"We want to play fearless cricket. We want to play hard cricket. We want to play smart cricket and I think we're going to go into the Pakistan game with the same mindset. We want to play fearless cricket regardless of who we play against,\" he said.\n\n© 2024 AFP",
    "summary": "The USA cricket team won their first-ever T20 World Cup game against Canada, thanks to a brilliant unbeaten 94 from Aaron Jones. The match was played in front of a passionate crowd of 7,000 at the purpose-built stadium, which is also the home of Major League Cricket. The win was a significant milestone for cricket in the USA, where the sport is not widely popular. The tournament organizers hope to increase the sport's popularity in the country. The crowd was largely made up of Indian-Americans, but there were also some local Americans who were attending their first cricket match. The USA team will next face Pakistan in a tougher test of their skills. Jones, the star of the match, is confident that his team can play fearless cricket and make a mark in the tournament.",

    "body": "The second edition of Major League Cricket set to be played from the 5th of July till the 28th is set to be a blockbuster affair. Australian Test and ODI skipper Pat Cummins has signed for the San Francisco Unicorns for the upcoming season.\n\nIn the inaugural edition of Major League Cricket in 2023, San Francisco Unicorns finished 5th in the table just above LA Knight Riders with 4 points from five matches. Pat Cummins will have a few more Australians for the company in the form of Matthew Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Josh Inglis and young Brody Couch.\n\nThis year the likes of Steve Smith, Travis Head, Nathan Ellis, Lance Morris, Glenn Maxwell, and Andrew Tye will be some of the other Aussies taking part in the tournament. MI New York are the current champion having the first season in a one-sided final.\n\nAustralian stars face travel hassles\n\nThe Australian is in West Indies for the T20 World Cup but most of their stars had to face a few issues. In a report published by the official website of the Australian Cricket Board, Pat Cummins was in transit for more than 48 hours. It is also learnt that the 31-year-old has lost his baggage while coming to the Caribbean.\n\nAustralian spinner Ashton Agar while addressing the media said “A lot of the boys are coming off a long time in India in the IPL, maybe 48 hours at home for a couple of them, so to do something like that is so refreshing”. Pat Cummins and the rest of the Australian stars are scheduled to start their practice for the tournament soon.\n\nAgar also added that “I think mentally once you’ve done that, you go into the sessions ready to go because you’ve already enjoyed what the Caribbean has to offer. We were sitting on the roof of the catamaran as we were coming back last night and ‘Stoin’ (Stoinis) actually mentioned that, ‘I don’t know if many other teams would be like this”\n\nEnding his chat with the media the left-arm spinner said “Getting them hitting to the side the wind is not going to is important. There’s been a lot of weather around so I imagine it will be windy every day here in Barbados. The good thing is we won’t be surprised,”",

    "body": "Two enterprise data protection companies, one old, one new – both public – are sponsoring two US cricket teams.\n\nNewly public Rubrik is the official cybersecurity sponsor for the San Francisco Unicorns’ Major League Cricket (MLC) season starting July 5 this year. The Unicorns’ roster features World Cup winners and global talents from international teams including Australia, Pakistan, and New Zealand. Long-time public company Commvault is an associate sponsor of the defending champions of Major League Cricket, MI New York, where Accenture is the principal sponsor. MI (Mumbai Indians) New York is a T20 cricket team established in 2023. The T20 format is shorter and, hopefully, faster paced than world test cricket games, entailing just 20 overs per innings.\n\nRubrik CMO Andres Botero said: “Unicorns are unique, special – a phenomenon. This notable Bay Area team brings innovation, excellence, and resilience to the cricket pitch, making this partnership a perfect match.”\n\nRubrik said it shares a common philosophy with the SF Unicorns built around a commitment to recruiting exceptional talent, delivering innovation, and relentlessness. Rubrik’s brand will be prominently displayed on the Unicorns’ team assets and uniforms throughout the season.\n\nSF Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman said: “Rubrik is exactly the kind of game-changing Unicorn the team is named for. This agreement is a testament to our shared commitment to excellence through talent, innovation and teamwork.”\n\nCommvault CMO Anna Griffin also said in a statement: “Sponsoring the MI New York cricket team is Commvault’s opportunity to support one of the most dynamic and fast-growing sports in the world. It’s a no-brainer.”\n\nCommvault’s sponsorship will feature opportunities to engage with fans including exclusive watch parties, contests, and cricket clinics with professional players. Fans, partners, and customers will also have the chance to join these events in the Dallas and Morrisville stadiums.\n\nGriffin said: “This partnership not only allows us to engage with cricket fans but also reinforces our dedication to fostering community and resilience. We’re excited to share the Commvault spirit and support the MI New York team on their journey. We’re thrilled to connect with cricket fans and bring the Commvault spirit to the pitch.”\n\nCommvault said cricket is the second most watched sport globally, with more than 2.5 billion fans. As cricket’s popularity surges in the United States, Commvault’s collaboration with MI New York aims to bring the thrill of the game to a broader, more diverse audience. In Commvault’s view, it serves as an opportunity to educate an untapped global fan base about the importance of resilience – critical knowledge that is applicable to both personal and professional life, whether on the pitch or in a Commvault Cleanroom defending against cyberattacks.\n\nMumbai Indians play in the Indian Premier League and is owned by Indiawin Sports Pvt. Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, one of India’s largest conglomerates. MI is a global cricketing force, with five T20 teams spanning three continents, and four countries including both men and women.\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns, in partnership with MLC, plan to build a world-class home for the team in the Bay Area, which will seat up to 15,000 people and be capable of hosting major international cricket events. The team’s primary investors are Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, who are founding partners of data-driven venture firm rocketship.vc, and previously founded US-focused database technology provider Junglee, which was sold to Amazon in 1998 for $250 million.",

    "body": "Cricket in the United StatesCountryUnited StatesGoverning bodyUSA CricketNational team(s)United StatesFirst playedbefore 1700\n\nNational competitions\n\nInternational competitions\n\nCricket in the United States is a sport played at the amateur, club, intercollegiate and international competition levels with little popularity, with 200,000 players (<0.1% of the population) across the country.[1] Major League Cricket is the highest level of domestic T20 cricket currently played in America, with T20 being the format of the game that much of the recent growth in American cricket is occurring in.[2][3]\n\nIn 2006 it was estimated that 30,000 people in the United States play or watch cricket annually.[4] By 2017, this figure had risen to 200,000 people playing cricket in 6,000 teams.[5] Cricket in the United States is not as popular as baseball and is not as popular among as large a fraction of the population as it is within either the Commonwealth nations or the other ICC full member (or Test cricket) nations.[6] There are at least two historical reasons for the relative obscurity of cricket within the United States. One reason was the 19th-century-rise of the summer time bat-and-ball sport now called baseball, which displaced cricket as a popular pastime.[6] Another reason was that in 1909 when the ICC was originally organized as the Imperial Cricket Conference it was open only to Commonwealth nations and thereby excluded the U.S. from participating in the sport at the highest level.[7]\n\nNevertheless, in 1965 the U.S. was admitted to the renamed ICC as an associate member and the sport grew in popularity in the second half of the 20th century. An oft mentioned reason for the growing popularity of cricket is the growing population of immigrants to the U.S. who come from cricket playing nations.[4][6]\n\nWith the launching of the United States Youth Cricket Association in 2010, a more focused effort to bring the game to American schools was begun, with the intention of broadening cricket's fan base beyond expatriates and their children.[8] In addition, USA Cricket has begun offering various championship tournaments for youth cricketers, such as the MLC Jr. Championship.[9]\n\nESPN has been stepping up its coverage of cricket in recent years, buying the cricket website Cricinfo in 2007, and broadcasting the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 competition, the 2014 Indian Premier League, English County Championship games, and international Test cricket.[10]\n\nIn 2021, Minor League Cricket, a professional Twenty20 cricket league sanctioned by USA Cricket, began play. Major League Cricket is planning to launch its first season in 2023.[11][12] In addition, various championships and pathways are being offered for youth cricketers, such as the MLC Jr. Championship.[13]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nCricket was played by British colonists in North America by the start of the 18th century.[14] Archived references to cricket played in America date from 1709. A New York newspaper from 1739 contains an advertisement for cricket players and the first documented competition occurred in 1751 in Manhattan.[15] According to William Byrd II's diary, cricket was played on the slave plantations of Virginia, including on his Westover estate among neighbors and slaves.[16] By 1793, Dartmouth College students were playing cricket on the Green.[17]\n\nPhiladelphia was the crucible of North American cricket and remains so today.[4] Haverford College formed a cricket team in 1833, generally accepted as the first cricket club exclusively for Americans.[18] Haverford and the University of Pennsylvania formed a strong rivalry, with the first match played on May 7, 1864, believed to be start of the third-oldest intercollegiate sporting contest in America, after the 1852 Harvard-Yale crew and 1859 Amherst-Williams baseball matches.[19] Haverford and Penn then proceeded to play each other for three consecutive years until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds.[20] From 1875 and through 1880, Haverford College, Columbia College and University of Pennsylvania fielded a varsity elevens, which played a few matches each year against each other and other club teams.[21]\n\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association,[22] which Cornell University later joined.[23] During the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924) Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the de facto national championship) 23 times (3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford), Haverford won such championship 19 times (3 shared with Penn and Harvard, 1 shared with Penn and Cornell, and 1 shared with Penn), and Harvard won it 6 times, none after 1899 (3 shared with Haverford and Penn).[24][circular reference][25]\n\nIn July 1895 an international cricket match between Canada and the United States was played on the Manheim grounds in Germantown section of Philadelphia with six of the United States team being Penn student athletes and, in September of that year, past and then current members of Penn's varsity cricket team played past and then current members of the English cricket teams of Oxford and Cambridge resulting in Penn defeating the Oxford-Cambridge team by one hundred runs.[23] This was not surprising as in the last two and a half decades of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century, Philadelphia was the center of cricket in the United States[26] Cricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the Merion Cricket Club and the Germantown Cricket Club).\n\nThe eleven-person team cricket familiar with Americans today took root most effectively at the St. George's Cricket Club, founded in 1838.[16] Clubs from the United States (St. George's CC) and Canada participated in one of the first international cricket matches on record in 1844 in Bloomingdale Park in Manhattan.[27][28] Cricket received a significant amount of media coverage at the time. In the mid-19th century, the sport was played in approximately 125 cities in 22 states. Roughly 500 officially established clubs existed and it is probable that in 1860 there were 10,000 boys and men in America who had actively played the sport for at least a season.[15]\n\nSt. George's CC employed Sheffield native Samuel Wright as its professional cricket playing groundsman. Wright's two sons, Harry and George, played for the United States XXII against the All England XI in 1859 in New York and Philadelphia.[29] Both Wright brothers became renowned in baseball circles after they played for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, America's first professional baseball team.[29] English cricket teams toured American regularly. Richard Daft's England side visited in 1869, when they played in New York and Philadelphia. Then with the spread of cricket to Boston, Lord Hawke's England XI played George Wright's New England Cricket XI at the Longwood Country Club in Boston. On the same tour in 1891 Lord Hawke's XI defeated a Germantown CC XI in Philadelphia, which included George Patterson, regarded as America's best batsman, with several centuries to his credit. George Patterson – referred to as America's W.G. Grace – was an American-born cricketer and lawyer by profession, described as brilliant under pressure when facing first-class English sides.[29]\n\nIt may have been during the Civil War that baseball overtook cricket and secured its place as America's game.[30] An army making a brief stop at a location could easily organise a game of baseball on almost any clear patch of ground, while cricket required a carefully prepared pitch. After the Civil War, baseball became a much more organized sport than cricket in America, with more money and competition available to baseball players across the country;[31][32] thus, baseball began to poach players and administrators from the world of cricket. It has been suggested that the fast-paced quick play of baseball was more appealing to Americans than the technical slower game of cricket,[30] which at the time was played over a much longer duration than baseball;[33] some attempts were made to nativize cricket in a way that would reduce its length and other perceived disadvantages relative to baseball, such as the American innovation of wicket, a variation of cricket which could be played in an afternoon.[34][35] However, the natural tendency toward baseball was compounded by terrible American defeats at the hands of a traveling English side in 1859, which may have caused Americans to think that they would never be successful at this English game.[36] By the end of the Civil War, most cricket fans had given up their hopes of broad-based support for the game. Baseball filled the role of the \"people's game\" and cricket became an amateur game for gentlemen.[30][37]\n\nGoverning bodies[edit]\n\nThe United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) previously served as the governing body for cricket in the United States, as an associate member of the ICC from 1965 to 2017. The USACA faced turmoil and governance issues in the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2005 the USACA was suspended from the ICC's annual conference due to issues with the association's election process, but that suspension was lifted in March 2006.[38] In February 2006, a competing commercial body, Major League Cricket (MLC), proposed that it replace the USACA as the United States' representative in the ICC, citing its more substantial efforts in developing the sport in the country (especially at grassroots levels such as schools, which the USACA had ignored), and accused the USACA of having \"the morbid opinion that they do not need any outside assistance whereas the development of the game.\"[39][40]\n\nThe USACA was suspended by the ICC in 2007 for its failure to adopt a constitution and hold elections in a timely manner, and the U.S. team pulled out of the World Cricket League Division Three.[41] The organization was suspended once again in 2015, citing \"significant concerns about the governance, finance, reputation and cricketing activities\" of the organization. However, the U.S. team was still allowed to continue competing in events such as the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, with ICC Americas serving as an interim caretaker of its cricket operations.[42][43] In 2017, the ICC voted to expel the USACA, citing its increasing debt and failure to ratify a certified constitution.[42]\n\nIn January 2019, a new body known as USA Cricket was approved as a new associate member of the ICC, replacing the USACA as the United States' representative.[44][45]\n\nNational teams[edit]\n\nMen's team[edit]\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. men's team was promoted to Division Two of the World Cricket League for the first time.[46] In 2019, the United States qualified for the inaugural season of its replacement, the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, whose top teams will move on to the qualifier for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.[47][48] On November 16, 2021, the ICC announced that the United States and West Indies would co-host the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup.[49] It will be the first ICC World Cup tournament to feature matches played in the United States - with three venues finalized in New York, Florida & Texas.[50]\n\nIn December 2021, the United States hosted Ireland in a T20I and ODI series, which marked the country's first-ever home series against a Test-playing nation.[51][52] The two teams split the T20 series.[53][54] However, the ODI series was cancelled due to COVID-19 issues.[55]\n\nWomen's team[edit]\n\nIn November 2021, the United States won the 2021 Women's T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier, advancing to the global qualifier for the 2023 Women's T20 World Cup.[56]\n\nDomestic competitions[edit]\n\nThere have been various attempts at domestic cricket leagues in the United States: Pro Cricket was formed in 2004 as a commercial cricket league not sanctioned by the ICC, which played a modified T20 format with changes intended to further increase the pace of the game, including five-ball overs.[57] The USACA, later in partnership with New Zealand Cricket, proposed a T20 competition known as the American Premier League, patterned after competitions such as the Indian Premier League. It was announced in 2009, but never came to fruition.[58][59] The American Twenty20 Championship was later held in 2011 as a three-day event in New Jersey between regional teams, to help develop and promote American players.[60]\n\nVia the investment arm American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), USA Cricket has sanctioned the domestic T20 league Minor League Cricket, and plans to launch the professional competition Major League Cricket (no relation to the aforementioned organization) in 2023.[61]\n\nInternational competitions[edit]\n\nOn November 16, 2021, the International Cricket Council announced that the United States along with the West Indies will co-host the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, making the first ICC World Cup Tournament to take place in the United States.[62][63] Team USA upset Team Pakistan in the 2024 Cricket World Cup.[64]\n\nCricket grounds[edit]\n\nThere are only a few purpose-built cricket grounds in the United States, they include the Germantown Cricket Club Ground and the Philadelphia Cricket Club Ground[65] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Randolph St. George Walker Park on Staten Island, New York; the Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill, Florida; and the Leo Magnus Cricket Complex in Van Nuys, California.\n\nThe Indianapolis World Sports Park in Indianapolis, Indiana, which features cricket grounds, was completed in 2014, and hosted the USACA's national championship that year.[66]\n\nThe game is also played on a number of shared purpose venues, they include Van Cortlandt Stadium in Bronx, New York and others.\n\nIn 2021, American Cricket Enterprises leased AirHogs Stadium, the home field of the defunct Texas AirHogs baseball team, to redevelop it as a cricket-specific stadium and USA Cricket training facility.[61] The revamped stadium was completed in 2023 and it was named as Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nThe main cricket grounds in the United States include:\n\nCentral Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill - Hosted 4 T20I since 2010. It is the home ground for the Ft. Lauderdale Lions in Minor League Cricket. It is also scheduled to host a few matches during the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie - The stadium is used for the Major League Cricket matches, it is also home ground for the Texas Super Kings.

    "title": "Here's The Out-Of-The-Box Boost World Cricket Needs — Include US In West Indies",
    "date": "Sat Jun  8 12:42:35 2024",
    "body": "The United States of America (US) and the West Indies, both co-hosts of the ongoing men’s T20 cricket world cup, are on an ascendency in cricket, though in different ways.\n\nWhat if these two regional ascendant forces of cricket came together and played as one?\n\nThe US has been creating space for cricket to grow in its shores for at least a handful of years in a significant way. They have been building stadiums, hosting professional tournaments like Major League Cricket, and developing the supporting infrastructure for cricket to flourish within the country.\n\nAs for letting the bat and ball do the talking, they have been on a roll there, as well. They recently beat Bangladesh 2-1 and before that gave neighbours Canada a 4-0 hammering, both at home.\n\nBy courtesy of these wins, they came in hot into the T20 world cup. Then, they beat rivals Canada in the tournament opener — and they did it in style, posting the third-highest successful run chase in a T20 cricket world cup.\n\nAnd then came the big win — beating the 2022 T20 world cup runner-up, Pakistan.\n\nThey will face a much stiffer opponent in India, and Ireland is decent too, in the days to come. But it’s safe to say that they can’t be ruled out from registering an upset after what they did against Pakistan — especially in the shortest format of the game where, as is said routinely, anyone can beat anyone else on a given day.\n\nHowever, for the US to come out of this group and move to the next stage would only be a bonus, an extraordinary one at that. By simply playing good competitive cricket and hosting the world cup well, the US would have already made a mark in cricket.\n\nDon't forget that they are playing host to a cricket world cup for the first time ever and are staging the biggest game of the tournament in India versus Pakistan — biggest because the US has a large diaspora from both countries.\n\nThese wins, both on and off the field, would probably be sufficient for the US to sustain its ascendency in a game billions of people around the world love, but is yet to hit its strides in a significant way in North America.\n\nUnlike the US, cricket is deeply rooted in the West Indies. They were the cricket powerhouse in the early years and remained competitive most years. Then, they found a format where they could once again claim the big prize and stamp their authority — and they did, becoming the T20 world cup champions twice in the previous decade. (Only England has matched them in this feat.)\n\nIt made sense for them to develop their version of the Indian Premier League (IPL), and thus was born the Caribbean Premier League (CPL). Just like in India, local talent got a domestic platform in which to perform and shine. The Caribbean players benefited especially by playing among some of the best cricket players in the world to ever do it.\n\nHowever, the West Indies hit a rough patch early this decade. The defending champions crashed out of the 2021 T20 world cup by failing to go past the super 12s, the main round preceding the semi-final and final rounds. They won a solitary game out of the five they played in this stage.\n\nIn the subsequent edition in 2022, they failed to make it past even the first round — losing against Scotland and Ireland, and winning one against Zimbabwe — finding themselves unable to move to either of the two main groups that would fight for the prize.\n\nIn a bigger blow, they failed to even qualify for the 2023 one-day international (ODI) world cup in India, after losing to Scotland in the super six stage of the world cup qualifiers in Zimbabwe. It was the first time that they didn’t feature in an ODI world cup since the coveted tournament began in the mid-1970s.\n\nSo, not only were the T20 world cup exits a major setback for a team whose slam-bang style was best-suited for success in the shortest format, they didn’t even get a chance to flex their muscle in ODIs. (They only just made it to the 2019 ODI world cup through the qualifiers, in more evidence, if necessary, of the team’s decline in limited-overs cricket over the years.)\n\nBut since then, the Windies have made a bit of a comeback. In the T20s, they won 3-2 against India and England at home in 2023. This year, they swept the T20 series against South Africa 3-0 playing at home. In the ongoing T20 world cup, they beat Australia in the warm-up game and won their first official game of the tournament, against Oman.\n\nThey’ve got a good taste of success of late and would want to keep the winning momentum going right through this tournament. After all, winning at home is a motivation that little else can match.\n\nTherefore, the US and the Windies have a lot to prove right now, both in their own ways. That being the case, here’s returning to the radical idea proposed earlier — club the US with the Windies for cricketing purposes.\n\nThe precedent for such a grouping lies in the Windies itself. The West Indies aren’t a political unit. They are a grouping of 15 nation-states and territories in the Caribbean region, all administered by one cricketing body — Cricket West Indies (CWI).\n\nMoreover, this composite unit isn’t set in stone. The fluid setup is open to more sign-ups, such as potentially the Bahamas. The US would make for a great cricketing addition to the Windies.\n\nThe US’ strength is their finances and infrastructure, alongside the experience of hosting world-class sporting events. In an interview with ESPNcricinfo, CWI and T20 World Cup chief executive Johnny Grave described the US as “the most developed sports market in the world” and added that “the more we can reach out to it, the more we are likely to attract high-value sponsors and broadcasters.”\n\nTwo of the three venues picked for the US leg of the T20 tournament, Grand Prairie (Dallas Texas) and Broward County (Lauderhill, Florida), already had the infrastructure in place to be a world cup venue. Still, the capacity at both these venues was lifted further by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\nThe third venue, at Nassau County in New York, came into being from scratch only this year. Modular stadium technology was used for the purpose, adopted previously at ICC events to increase venue capacity. There are several other cricketing venues in the US waiting to be developed further in order to accommodate more games and people in the stands.\n\nIn any case, the North American market is ripe for cricket to be embraced in a more significant way, potentially benefiting both the region and the game. And in the shorter term, the ICC is eyeing the addition of cricket in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.\n\n“We strategically decided to bid for the men's T20 World Cup… jointly with the US because we wanted to grow the sport in our time zone, which we believe is crucial to our long-term survival,” Grave told ESPNcricinfo.\n\nWhile the US can lead the physical infrastructure side of things, the Windies can show the way with its talent. Some of the best ever cricket players have come from the West Indies over the years — Joel Garner, Clive Lloyd, Malcolm Marshall, Vivian Richards, Michael Holding, Brian Lara, Curtly Ambrose, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, to name only a few.\n\nThis is not to say that the US takes a backseat with its players. They have extraordinary talent to offer themselves — consider captain Monank Patel and some of the heroes of the Canada and Pakistan contests, Andries Gous, Aaron Jones, and Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nFurther, left-arm seamer Tara Norris, who played for Delhi Capitals in the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in 2023, made history by bagging the tournament’s first five-wicket haul and took player-of-the-match honours. She went on to pick up seven wickets in five games. (Shockingly, she went unsold in WPL 2024.)\n\nStill, there are places up for grabs in the US' cricket team, as is evident from the ambitious recruitment drive pursued by USA Cricket for years.\n\nThe effort has led to the inclusion of foreign players like New Zealand’s Corey Anderson, England’s Liam Plunkett, Pakistan-origin Ali Khan, and India’s Harmeet Singh. US team’s deputy, Jones, is also originally from Barbados.\n\nUSA cricket’s idea has been to win games before thinking about achieving an all-US composition.\n\nA potential US-Windies grouping could comfortably put together tens of elite cricket players, who could fill up additional teams in the way that India has its A, B, and C teams alongside the main national team. The supplementary teams could act as a feeder to continuously keep putting the very best talent out there on the world cricket stage.\n\nIt’s easy to imagine how competitive such a team would be, making global cricket more competitive than it is now.\n\nThat’s that about the venues and players. What about the US viewers? Will they watch games of cricket?\n\nInitially, of course, the viewership will have to be driven primarily by the country’s 50 lakh-odd-strong South Asian diaspora. The hope will be that they will turn up to the ground in sizable numbers and enjoy watching cricket, before the fever gradually catches on to the rest of the population.\n\nPerhaps, cricket might never become as popular as baseball or basketball in the US, but it doesn’t need to. The US is a large enough country to accommodate the sporting interests and needs of a 33-odd-crore-strong population.\n\nThere’s enough cricket interest to go around already. “I don't think people know actually how much cricket there is in this country,” Gous told the Washington Freedom franchise last year, as per ESPNcricinfo. “It's ridiculous. Everywhere in the country there's cricket. If you want to play 12 months a year, you'll find it.”\n\nA joint statement hailing CWI and USA Cricket’s successful joint bid to host the 2024 men’s T20 world cup spoke of “aims to unlock the potential of the USA and fast track the growth of the sport; to inspire the next generation of young West Indians and ignite the cricketing passion in the Caribbean; and to combine these two forces for the benefit of world cricket.”\n\nWhile they may not have thought of uniting as one cricketing unit when they said “combine these two forces,” it might be an idea to consider “for the benefit of world cricket.”",

    "body": "US Major League Cricket Drawing High-Profile Cricketers With Unrivalled Commercial Opportunities\n\nThe US Major League Cricket continues to make waves, signing Australian Test captain Pat Cummins to a substantial four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns in the rapidly expanding US T20 tournament. This move underscores the growing appeal of cricket in America, where major commercial opportunities are luring high-profile players.\n\nCummins’ decision was influenced by the potential long-term prospects beyond cricket and the chance to network in Silicon Valley, a global hub of technology. This strategic signing enhances Major League Cricket’s (MLC) reputation as a premier T20 destination, indicating a power shift from traditional leagues like the Big Bash League in Australia.\n\nThe inclusion of Australian stars such as Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell further boosts the competition, which is in its infancy with just one season completed. Cummins, who last played in the Big Bash in 2018 due to national commitments, has maintained his connection with the league through ambassadorial roles. Despite his success in the IPL, where he earned over $3 million as captain of the Sunrisers this season, Cummins is seeking new challenges and opportunities in the flourishing American cricket scene.\n\nCummins expressed his optimism for cricket’s future in the US, noting the rapid development of Major League Cricket and the vast market potential. The global connections and extended possibilities offered by the team owners and Silicon Valley’s thriving ecosystem are significant attractions beyond the game itself.\n\nThe MLC, scheduled from July 6 to 29 this year following the World Cup, could pose availability challenges for Cummins next year due to a two-Test series in the West Indies during June and July. Joining Cummins at the San Francisco Unicorns this season is batting sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk, further strengthening the team’s lineup. The Washington Freedom has also secured renowned Australians like Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, and Steve Smith for the upcoming season.\n\nIn a significant boost for the league, MLC has gained List A status for its second season, elevating its standing as an official T20 competition with records now contributing to official T20 statistics. As cricket continues to evolve in the USA, stay tuned for more exciting developments in this burgeoning sports market.",

    "body": "Reports are indicating that a new women’s T20 franchise tournament might soon take place in the United States. Although the idea is still in its nascent stages, key figures in American cricket are eager to leverage a unique opportunity.\n\nThis opportunity arises from the upcoming 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the recent success of the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) men’s T20 tournament.\n\nWith cricket poised to debut in the 2028 Olympics and the USA women’s national team likely qualifying as hosts, there is a growing recognition of the need to foster the women’s game domestically. The recent success of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in India, where international stars have earned substantial salaries, underscores the commercial viability of women’s T20 cricket.\n\nThough the proposed tournament is still in the discussion phase, it would aim to attract top global players and potentially run alongside the existing men’s franchises in the MLC. Owners of several MLC franchises, including the Ambani family who own MI New York, have shown interest in developing women’s teams. This initiative could significantly enhance the profile and earnings of women’s cricketers worldwide.\n\nShould these plans come to fruition, they could impact the international schedules of England’s women cricketers and their participation in domestic tournaments such as The Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has already increased domestic women’s players’ earnings, but these still lag behind the lucrative offers seen in the WPL.\n\nStarting a Women’s T20 Cricket League in the USA: A Major Boost for the Sport\n\nEstablishing a women’s T20 franchise league in the USA would be a landmark event for cricket, providing a stage for the best talent globally to display their skills and potentially inspiring a new generation of American women cricketers.\n\nOver recent years, USA Cricket has made significant strides in the sport. Notably, the upcoming ICC men’s T20 World Cup in 2024 will be the first ICC event hosted in America.\n\nThe development of a women’s T20 franchise league in the USA is seen as a timely and strategic move to enhance the sport’s domestic presence. It represents not only a significant boost for women’s cricket but also an important step in the broader growth and popularity of cricket in the United States.\n\nThe initiative aligns with the global trend of increasing investment in women’s sports, highlighting the growing recognition of women’s cricket as a commercially viable and exciting proposition.",

    "date": "Fri May 31 07:48:12 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC) has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the United States.\n\nThe Guardian said the US league now has six franchises but plans to launch two more in the near future, and two more soon after that.\n\nThe announcement comes just after MLC has been fully legitimised by the news that its matches have been awarded List A status by the International Cricket Council.\n\nThe significant development marks yet another crucial milestone in the growth and status of Cognizant Major League Cricket, and cricket more broadly in the United States.\n\nIt recognizes Cognizant Major League Cricket as an official T20 league and America’s first world-class domestic tournament.\n\nNow, every century, half-century, ‘five-for’, run-out, win, loss, and championship will be documented as official career statistics in an internationally recognized format of the game.\n\nThis will also provide local US players and upcoming stars of the game the opportunity for international recognition, furthering the development of domestic talent by the MLC.\n\nThe List-A Status comes after the MLC’s successful inaugural season and underscores its unwavering dedication to delivering premier cricket in the United States.\n\nIn addition to the official List-A status, MLC CEO, Vijay Srinivasan, recently announced aspirations to expand from what began as a 19-game season in 2023 to a 34-game season by 2025.\n\nHe said, “It was always intended to be a 10‑team league. Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nThe Guardian further stated that the move will have significant implications for the landscape of the professional sport in England.\n\nThe second season, which starts at the end of the men’s T20 World Cup, runs for 23 days and overlaps with The Hundred.\n\nThe US tournament next year will be significantly longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC is keen to play in June.\n\nHe said, “Ultimately for us our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer. With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nThat would clash with the T20 Blast season in England but leave The Hundred to run from late July through August.\n\nMLC’s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed that it was the “direction of travel” for the game on 10 May, but there is frustration about slow progress.\n\nMLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local players. It is now working on developing more List A venues. “We’re not here to play a league and go away every year,” Srinivasan said.\n\n“We feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think 10 years from now, I think you’ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we’ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.”\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.

    "date": "Fri May 31 12:34:13 2024",
    "body": "Read Also: England Clinches Series Victory\n\nEarly Investors and Launch of Major League Cricket (MLC)\n\nThe US Cricket Board has talked about starting a franchise-based cricket league in 2018. Overcoming the initial hurdles, $120 million i.e. about Rs one thousand crore was raised for the league in May 2022.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, Shah Rukh Khan co-owned IPL franchise KKR, technology entrepreneur Anand Rajaraman, and former Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan were among the early investors. The first season of the MLC was played in July 2023 with 6 teams. All the teams consisted of Indian investors. Actor Shah Rukh Khan is a co-owner of IPL franchise KKR, IndiaWin Sports, the company that runs Mumbai Indians (MI), GMR Sports, the owner of Delhi Capitals, and Chennai Super Kings bought teams with different partners.\n\nStructure and Results of MLC’s First Season:\n\nThe first season of the MLC had 15 group-stage matches played between July 14 and July 26. The four playoff matches took place on July 27, 28 and 30. All 19 games were played at the Dallas and Morrisville stadiums. The group stage saw 6 teams playing 5-5 matches, i.e. one team played a 1-1 match with the other 5 teams.\n\nLike the IPL, the first season of the MLC had the top-4 teams qualifying for the playoffs. MI New York played the final match after winning the Eliminator and Qualifier-2. The team defeated Seattle Orcas by 7 wickets in the final and won the title of the first season.\n\nNicholas Pooran scored a century, he was also the highest run-scorer in the tournament. MI’s Trent Boult took the highest number of 22 wickets. American Cameron Gannon was the Man of the Tournament by taking 11 wickets for Seattle Orcas.\n\nUpcoming Second Season of MLC\n\nThe final match of the T20 World Cup will be held on June 29. Six days after this, the second season of MLC will start in America on July 6. This time also matches will be played in only 2 stadiums, but 21 matches will be played in the group stadium instead of 15. A team will play 7 matches instead of 5. Season 2 of MLC will start immediately after the World Cup, which will connect the global cricket audience with the American audience. The matches of the second season will start at 12:30 pm and 6 am Indian time. According to America, this time it will be night, so more fans will reach the stadium and watch the match.\n\nChallenges for MLC in Competing with IPL:\n\nThe brand value of IPL is Rs 89 thousand crore, while the brand value of MLC is Rs 1 thousand crore. Rs 1,000 crore is spent on the salaries of players in IPL, while only Rs 57 crore is spent on the salaries of players in MLC.\n\nWhile cricket is not among the top 10 most watched sports in America, no other sport is watched more than cricket in India. Major League Cricket (MLC) is currently in its initial stages, where 6 foreign players can play in the playing-11. In comparison, only 4 foreign players play in IPL. The biggest reason for the success of IPL in India is Indian players. Therefore, if MLC has to compete with IPL, it will first have to improve the quality of players in its country. Which now seems to take a lot of time.\n\nThe International Cricket Council approved List-A for Major League Cricket on May 28. This means that now the statistics of players and teams in this tournament will also be counted in T20 records. The second season of MLC will begin on July 6, just 6 days after the T20 World Cup.\n\nIn the second season, there will be an increase from 19 to 25 matches. It is planned to increase to 34 matches by 2025, increasing the number of teams from 6 to 8. The MLC chief executive said the MLC plans to eventually make it a 10-team tournament. Barring the IPL, no country has ever had 10 teams in any franchise tournament. It will be important to see how the T20 World Cup will affect Major League Cricket.",
    "summary": "**Launch and Investors**: The MLC was launched in 2022 with an investment of $120 million from investors including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Shah Rukh Khan, and others.\n\n**First Season**: The first season of MLC was played in July 2023 with 6 teams, all owned by Indian investors. The season consisted of 15 group-stage matches and 4 playoff matches, with MI New York winning the title. Nicholas Pooran was the highest run-scorer, and Trent Boult took the highest number of wickets.\n\n**Upcoming Second Season**: The second season of MLC will start on July 6, with 21 group-stage matches and 7 matches per team. The matches will be played in two stadiums, and the timing will be adjusted to attract more fans.\n\n**Challenges**: MLC faces challenges in competing with the Indian Premier League (IPL), with a significant difference in brand value and player salaries. To succeed, MLC needs to improve the quality of American players.\n\n**International Recognition**: The International Cricket Council approved List-A status for MLC, allowing player and team statistics to be counted in T20 records.\n\n**Future Plans**: The MLC plans to increase the number of matches to 34 by 2025 and eventually become a 10-team tournament, a first for any franchise tournament outside of the IPL.",

    "date": "Wed Jun 26 09:26:00 2024",
    "body": "Apparently, the United States national cricket team’s victory against Pakistan in the 2024 T20 World Cup earlier this month has created higher enthusiasm for the sport domestically. That’s the gamble Monumental Sports Network is taking, at any rate. The regional sports network (RSN) which serves fans in Washington, D.C., the DMV and parts of Pennsylvania has announced a new partnership with Willow by Cricbuzz to distribute a package of Major League Cricket matches featuring the Washington Freedom, beginning with a match on Saturday, July 6.\n\nMonumental Sports is available on DIRECTV STREAM, Hulu Live TV, and YouTube TV.\n\nKey Details:\n\nMonumental Sports Network’s coverage of Washington Freedom cricket will continue through July.\n\nViewers can watch Monumental as part of a pay-TV subscription, or in-market with the Monumental Sports Network App.\n\nMajor League Cricket matches are normally broadcast on Willow TV in the United States.\n\nMonumental is partnering with Willow to offer seven Washington Freedom cricket matches, beginning on July 6 and continuing through July 22. The matches will join WNBA basketball contests from the Washington Mystics, though they won’t be available on Monumental long enough to air alongside NBA games from the Washington Wizards or NHL matchups featuring the Washington Capitals on the channel.\n\nCheck out Monumental’s schedule of Washington Freedom matches:\n\nDate Time (ET) Opponent Saturday, July 6 3 p.m. MI New York Monday, July 8 3 p.m. Texas Super Kings Thursday, July 11 8:30 p.m. Seattle Orcas Sunday, July 14 3:30 p.m. LA Knight Riders Tuesday, July 16 8:30 p.m. MI New York Friday, July 19 8:30 p.m. Texas Super Kings Monday, July 22 8:30 p.m. San Francisco Unicorns\n\nThe presentations are being made in partnership with Willow, which carries all MLC matches on the Willow TV channel and Willow on-demand streaming platform. Chief operating officer of Willow Todd Myers specifically cited the U.S. national team’s victory at the T20 World Cup as an inciting factor for the partnership with Monumental.\n\n“The unexpected success of the US national cricket team in the T20 World Cup has vividly shown us the untapped potential of cricket in America,” Myers said. “We are now at a pivotal turning point where we can leverage the country’s excitement and passion for the sport to build a broader, more engaged fan base nationwide. Our partnership with Monumental Sports Network is key in this transformative era, bringing premier cricket directly to American viewers and giving them a hometown team, the Washington Freedom, to cheer for.”\n\n“Washington Freedom matches are an electric addition to our summer programming lineup and further our commitment to all sports fans throughout the DMV,” added Caitlin Mangum, VP, Content & Programming at Monumental Sports Network. “Cricket is undergoing a surge of popularity in the U.S. and we’re excited for a new audience to get exposure to the plethora of live, local sports programming on our air.”\n\nWill Other RSNs Try to Add Live Cricket Rights?\n\nThe addition of live cricket matches based off what’s likely a temporary ratings boost for the sport thanks to a single World Cup victory from Team USA may seem like a bit of an overreaction to some. But with the cost of marquee sports rights climbing inexorably, providers are looking for any way to bring new content to their airwaves without paying extreme amounts to get it.\n\nThat could lead more RSNs to add small cricket packages of their own in the near future. Major League Cricket only has six teams at the moment, but some are stationed in cities like Los Angeles and New York where viewers have access to SportsNet-branded RSNs. I don’t think any cricket teams playing in areas where a Bally Sports channel is the dominant RSN will see a new deal with Willow to distribute games in the near future; Diamond Sports Group, which owns the Bally Sports channels, has enough problems with the partner leagues it currently has at the moment.",

    "body": "Pat Cummins became Cricket Australia’s first $3 million player last year, and earned another $3.67 million at this year’s IPL, but money had nothing to do with him joining the San Francisco Unicorns in America’s fledgling Major League Cricket competition.\n\nAustralia’s Test and one-day captain was planning some time at home but has instead jumped at the opportunity to build relationships with some of America’s most successful entrepreneurs in nearby Silicon Valley.\n\nThe most an MCL player can earn is about $300,000 for seven regular games and, potentially, two finals. Cummins earned more than $216,000 a match in the IPL.\n\nThe lead investors in the San Francisco team, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, friends from Chennai who completed computer science PhDs at Stanford University and have become successful entrepreneurs, initiated the chase for Cummins.\n\n“Of course we’re huge fans of Pat Cummins and really wanted him to join the team,” Rajaraman told this masthead. “But what really helps us out is how sort of tech-savvy and forward-thinking Pat Cummins is.\n\n“He was thinking of his career beyond cricket, and he’s thinking about how to do interesting things at the intersection of technology and cricket, even after his playing days are done.\n\n“He felt it would be valuable for him to develop deep relationships with Silicon Valley. We are, fortunately, in Silicon Valley, and we can help connect that.\n\n“All the top companies and the top venture capitals are here, and we can help him network and build the kind of knowledge that he wants about start-ups and venture capital and so on. That’s why it kind of worked out.”\n\nCummins’ manager, Neil Maxwell, said the player was excited about the opportunities.\n\n“He’s a very curious bloke, and he likes to learn,” Maxwell said. “He finds that learning about these things is really interesting.\n\n“There’s a range of people connected to this franchise, including the CEO of YouTube, CEO of Adobe. It just opens up Silicon Valley.”\n\nCummins, who is in the West Indies preparing for Australia’s Twenty20 World Cup match against Bangladesh on Friday morning (AEST), may be the world’s only premier fast bowler with a degree in business management.\n\nIt was a strange signing because the Unicorns are supported by Cricket Victoria, while his home state of NSW supports the Washington Freedom. The four other teams in the MLC are run by IPL franchises.\n\nLoading\n\nRajaraman and Harinarayan approached Cricket Victoria chief Nick Cummins about signing the elite paceman.\n\nNick Cummins once worked with Pat Cummins as general manager of the Sydney Thunder, and knew it would take more than another T20 competition to clinch the deal.\n\n“Pat was pretty clear: ‘I’m not looking for more opportunities to play cricket,’” Nick Cummins told this masthead.\n\n“My conversation with him and Neil was more around, ‘This is so much more than cricket, thinking about your aspirations and what you want to do beyond cricket.’\n\n“It’s a chance to connect with the tech community in Silicon Valley, connect with the greenest state in America around what he’s doing for Cricket for Climate [an environmental organisation], and I think that’s what really excited him about it.”\n\nSports news, results and expert commentary.

    "body": "Alright, enough with the mean jokes, it’s no fault of the good people of Long Island. While the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup leaves American shores over the weekend and heads out for the West Indies, the hard yards of ‘taking cricket to America’ story continue. Five days after the World Cup final, Season 2 of Major League Cricket begins, featuring six franchise teams over two venues — Grand Prairie in Texas and Morrisville in North Carolina.\n\nSeason one of MLC was deemed a success, Forbes reporting revenues at $8m with 17,000 spectators across the 18-day, 19-match league last year. Sanjay Govil, owner of MLC franchise Washington Freedom who moved to the US in the 1980s, said for decades “we never thought cricket was going to come to us”. But it’s here and he has a hand in it, as the only solo owner of an MLC franchise. Freedom gets its name, he says, from striving, throwing away shackles, taking a different path. Of the other five franchises, three are owned and run by IPL big dads: Texas Super Kings, LA Knight Riders and defending champions MI New York. The other two, Seattle Orcas and San Francisco Unicorns, have many millionaire co-owners.\n\nGovil is pleased that Freedom, who partnered with Cricket NSW for game management, made the playoffs and finished third in Season 1. Season 2 should have them better prepared, with a new CEO, Cricket NSW still involved and a roster that reads Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, Steve Smith, Marco Jansen, and T20 World Cup Team USA superhero, Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nWhat MLC is doing, Govil says, is unlike mainstream cricket. “We’re not just building a league but we’re also building the sport in the US. That’s a very different paradigm as compared to other countries. A harder thing to do.” Within the first decade of the MLC, he says, the dream is that cricket becomes a “semi mainstream” game — “like lacrosse or rugby” and MLC occupies a spot just behind the top US leagues: gridiron football, basketball, baseball and ice hockey.\n\nThis will mean “not just promoting major cricket, but also minor cricket, academies, cricket in schools, having an expanded grassroot kind of thing. That is going to be very, very paramount in how we approach cricket in the US.” Increasing playing numbers from more than 100,000 weekend players, from a predominantly South Asian diaspora audience, is also part of the mission. The size of the cricket-viewing audience in the US ranges between three million to a wild consultancy figure of 25 to 30m. Govil overall is realistic. “To get to where we want — is a 20, 30, 40-year journey.”\n\nIn MLC1, 12 of 19 matches were held in the Grand Prairie (GP) cricket stadium in suburban Dallas. The ground was repurposed from an abandoned baseball venue called AirHogs Stadium for the Texas AirHogs, which folded in 2020. This exercise led to MLC being called the “hermit crabs of sports leagues by D Magazine sports editor Mike Piellucci. Like the hermit crab, MLC found an empty shell of the AirHogs stadium, climbed into it, and from there have turned Grand Prairie into “Cricket City, USA”.\n\nIn the World Cup, Grand Prairie provided the best playing surface and spectator experience. Once again, it will host 16 of the 25 MLC2 matches, with Morrisville’s Church Street Park staging the other nine. Piellucci, Dallas-born and bred, reminds me that cricket has made its entry into Dallas at a time when the city/region is enjoying its golden era across the big leagues.\n\nThe Texas Rangers have won the Major League Baseball world series, the Dallas Mavericks are in the NBA finals, its NHL team Dallas Stars have made two conference finals in a row. “And the football team (Dallas Cowboys) is the most valuable sports franchise in the world.”\n\nHe says not only will cricket have to “break through” the buzz created by the other leagues, “there’s no lull period because you are going from success to success.” Time for the Texas Super Kings to pull out their cricket league A-game, no doubt.\n\nMLC has been positioned for July, which is known though as a ‘dry season’ for US sport in between the leagues. With summer temperatures in Dallas rising, Piellucci suggests getting a roof over the cricket ground would be a good idea. “The owners will have to convince people to go out and engage in a sport that they might not know about and do it when the weather is really, really hot...it’s a tough sell to kind of work with.”\n\nIn trying to explain Dallas’ response to its sports teams, Piellucci told contrasting stories between football/soccer and ice hockey. Dallas was an original market for Major League Soccer (Dallas Burn/FC Dallas) “but they’ve never had this huge groundswell of support…” this despite the fact that people love the sport and that Dallas is a big hub for youth soccer and its talent development pathway.\n\n“There's a ton of talent that comes out of here… but the (MLS) team itself doesn't have the support because I guess they’re not successful… they’ve not been a consistent winner…” While the Dallas Stars ice-hockey team is much loved — even in this non-traditional ice hockey market — because, Piellucci says, “they never really tank…what they do is they’re consistently very good.” Plus, the last two seasons have had them produce “truly excellent” results.\n\nCricket must grab eyeballs in a multi-sports-league-saturated market. Dallas-Fort Worth teams also play in leagues across rugby, ultimate frisbee, and the spring football minor league called United Football League. In May 2024, Dallas Trinity FC women’s professional soccer team joined the USL Super League.\n\nThe MLC, however, cannot be the only event to build cricket's popularity in the country because, Piellucci says, the other leagues “are constantly on people’s minds.” He says, “It can’t just be major league cricket, there have to be more competitions, other competitions… going a few different times a year… you have to get a foothold on the calendar and claw to stay in people’s minds, to remind them.”\n\nCricket's growth story in the most lucrative market outside South Asia has to somehow stay relevant even after MLC2 ends in mid-July. Piellucci says it’s not just about gaining a foothold now, but also “don’t get people to forget about you the other 46 weeks of the year?” It’s no surprise that he and his magazine called MLC, and through it cricket in the US, as the “greatest experiment in pro sport”.",

    "body": "The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by the US and Caribbean countries, quickly delivered a thrilling surprise. Team USA — largely comprised of non-resident Indians, some sharing alma maters with their Indian counterparts — stunned Pakistan with an unexpected early victory in the tournament.\n\nCricket, overshadowed by America's beloved baseball, is experiencing a remarkable revival. Last year's launch of Major League Cricket has ignited a wave of enthusiasm, drawing significant investments from notable South Asian-Americans like Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai.\n\nWhat's behind this cricket craze in America? While the sport is still warming up to locals, its resurgence is fuelled by the fervent support of the South Asian diaspora. Looking ahead, cricket's integration into the 2028 LA Olympics as a primary sport — the first such occurrence in over a century — signals a bright future.\n\nThis scenario presents a win-win: South Asians in the US can indulge in their beloved sport, while the International Cricket Council (ICC) taps into a lucrative new market, expanding cricket’s global footprint.\n\nOn to best of Mint’s journalism this week:\n\n🇮🇳 Finally, after seven weeks of marathon elections, the new government was sworn in on Sunday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi opted for continuity over sweeping changes as he began his third term. Modi reaffirmed his confidence in key ministers like Amit Shah and Nirmala Sitharaman, retaining them from his previous Union cabinet. Key allies, including the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal (United), also secured Cabinet posts, indicating a coalition setup. Mint’s Rituraj Baruah, Manas Pimpalkhare, and Subhash Narayan report on the swearing in and appointments, which took place amid a sizable gathering of around 9,000 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, with political figures and celebrities in attendance. The new Union cabinet consists of 30 ministers, featuring a notable presence of veterans from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and leaders from allied parties who have demonstrated strong electoral performances in their regions. This composition is seen as an effort to stabilize the government's position, given the BJP's reduced majority.\n\n🎥 India's independent films, celebrated at international festivals, struggle to secure a spot in domestic theatres, overshadowed by blockbuster hits. Titles like the recent Cannes winner All We Imagine As Light and other festival favourites such as All That Breathes, Agra, and Kennedy find themselves eclipsed by mainstream blockbusters. The business model of cinema in India has shifted, favouring multiplexes with high ticket prices, making it harder for indie films, which often lack big stars and mass appeal. Unlike in the past, when ticket costs were low and films reached a bigger audience, today's indie films face prohibitive marketing costs that many cannot afford. This need for significant marketing investment, often in the millions, puts these films at a disadvantage, confining them to less than 100 screens in major cities, compared to thousands for mainstream films. Mint’s media and entertainment correspondent Lata Jha reports on the challenges indie flicks face in their bid to reach mainstream audiences.\n\n💼 Maniraj Pattamsetti, a mechanical engineering graduate from Bengaluru, hoped that Simplilearn Solutions’ job guarantee programme would be his gateway to a new career in data science. Despite investing over ₹2 lakh in a six-month course, Pattamsetti found himself working a customer support role in a BPO, earning far less than promised and without any job offers in his field of study. Simplilearn had assured Pattamsetti and others a job with a minimum salary of ₹5 lakh per year upon completion of the programme—and a full refund if they failed to secure employment. However, two years on, only 271 out of 900 enrollees have landed jobs through the programme. Many, like Pattamsetti, feel cheated, having invested significant amounts in an education that didn’t pay off as expected. Mint’s startup correspondent Samiksha Goel reports on the situation, which has led to numerous complaints, with some students considering legal action against Simplilearn, a company valued at $600 million and backed by private equity giant Blackstone. Simplilearn has since discontinued the programme, leaving many students grappling with debt and disappointment. This scenario underscores the challenges within the edtech sector, where aggressive sales tactics and overpromising can sometimes lead to significant consumer dissatisfaction.\n\n📊 N. Chandrababu Naidu was sworn in as the 18th chief minister of Andhra Pradesh on 12 June. Naidu’s term begins under challenging conditions, as he inherits a financially strained state that has been largely overlooked industrially. His Telugu Desam Party (TDP), along with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners, secured a sweeping victory, capturing 164 out of 175 seats in the state assembly. During his campaign, Naidu promised to enhance governance and kickstart economic development, aiming to revive industrial activity and generate 2 million jobs. However, the financial reality of Andhra Pradesh could complicate these plans. The state is grappling with a high debt level—44% of its GDP—and its finances are stretched thin, primarily going towards revenue expenditures rather than building productive assets. This fiscal strain makes the ambitious welfare promises and the revival of the Amaravati capital project, initially estimated to cost ₹50,000 crore, particularly challenging. Mint’s senior editor N. Madhavan explains the hurdles Naidu faces as he takes over from Jagan Mohan Reddy as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.\n\n✅ During the recent Lok Sabha election, many urban voters seemed reluctant to visit their polling booths. The Election Commission highlighted this trend, noting a particularly low turnout in urban areas. Ultimately, only about 65.8% of eligible voters cast their ballots, down from 67.2% in 2019. Regions like Nagaland and Manipur saw significant decreases in turnout, while Jammu and Kashmir experienced an increase. Why does this matter? Niti Kiran from Mint’s data team explains through charts and maps. Lower turnouts can sometimes indicate voter satisfaction with the current government, which appeared to be the case in this election. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) held more seats in areas with lower voter turnout. However, it's not just about the numbers—it's about who shows up, or rather, who doesn’t. Metros saw a sharper decline in turnout compared to rural regions. Despite this, the overall gender gap in voting was virtually non-existent, similar to the previous election. Women turned out in higher numbers than men in nearly 20 states. The reasons behind voter participation or apathy can vary widely from state to state, influencing everything from local policy to national politics.\n\n🫀 India is on the verge of significant changes to its organ transplant policies, aiming to address the massive shortfall between the supply and demand of organs. The Union government is considering allowing organ exchanges between unrelated individuals to bridge the gap when blood groups within families do not match, potentially shortening the long wait times endured by patients. Currently, India faces a significant disparity between the demand for transplants and the number performed each year. While the country needs approximately 200,000 kidney transplants annually, only 6,000 are carried out. The situation is even more dire for heart transplants, with just 10 to 15 procedures conducted yearly One significant move under consideration is the introduction of \"swap\" donations, where families could exchange organs with one another if they are compatible, a practice currently not allowed for non-relatives. Additionally, the government is in talks with the insurance regulator to extend health insurance coverage to organ donors, who are presently excluded from most health insurance plans. Mint’s Priyanka Sharma reports on these pivotal policy changes.\n\n🦹‍♂️ The 2024 Lok Sabha election brought a significant political shift, yet the prevalence of criminal charges among newly-elected Members of Parliament (MPs) remains a concerning issue. With 46% of the MPs having declared criminal cases against them, this marks a slight increase from the previous assembly. The data suggests a persistent and troubling connection between politics and crime in India's legislature. More alarming is the nature of these cases. A significant portion of the MPs face 'serious' criminal charges involving severe crimes such as murder and rape. This situation casts a shadow over the credibility of the lawmakers and raises ethical questions about the integrity of those elected to represent the public. Mint’s Manjul Paul illustrates, with charts and maps, the extent to which individuals with criminal cases have been elected as public representatives in the 18th Lok Sabha.\n\n📉 For India's IT sector, FY24 has been a year to forget, and FY25 doesn't look much brighter. Discretionary IT spending, crucial for the sector's growth, remains subdued amid weak global macro-economic situation. This gloom is reflected in the muted performance across key business verticals like banking, financial services, insurance (BFSI), high-tech, and retail. Even robust deal wins in the March quarter haven't translated into expected revenue growth, adding to the uncertainty, Mint’s Harsha Jethmalani reports. Cost-efficiency measures and sluggish client decision-making, making the revenue recovery timeline unpredictable, has exacerbated the situation. Notably, projections for technology spending in 2024 by major US banks suggest a slowdown compared to the previous year. This has led to a cautious outlook for FY25, with leading IT companies like Infosys and HCL Technologies setting modest growth targets that have failed to boost investor confidence. Amid these challenges, there's a silver lining. Possible interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve could revive the BFSI sector, potentially increasing IT spending.\n\n🔋 On 9 February 2023, the Geological Survey of India announced a groundbreaking discovery of 5.9 million tonnes of lithium reserves in Jammu and Kashmir, catapulting India into the top 10 nations with lithium resources and sparking immediate interest from major companies like JSW Group and Hindalco Industries. This announcement shifted the dynamics of India's mineral exploration focus, as lithium is essential for batteries used in various technologies, including electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy storage. However, the excitement was tempered by the auction for these reserves, which saw only two bidders and had to be cancelled due to insufficient interest. This highlighted the speculative nature of the unproven reserves, still classified under G3, indicating a low level of confidence and substantial further exploration needed. Exploration of the lithium reserves in Kashmir—the least mined region of India—remains a tricky situation many companies are reluctant to engage in. The reserves were found merely 50 km from the Line of Control (LoC), a highly volatile geopolitical location. Mint’s Sumant Banerji examines the reasons behind the lack of interest in India’s white gold reserves.\n\n👩‍🎓 🧑‍⚕️ The recently concluded National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), crucial for admissions for medical course,has faced serious scrutiny. An unusual outcome where 67 candidates, including six from one centre, topped the rankings triggered allegations of leaked papers, and in turn protests. This scrutiny led to the National Testing Agency (NTA) scrapping grace marks for 1,536 students due to procedural issues and announcing a re-test option. Coaching institutes across the country, have now made their apprehensions clear about the irregularities in the NEET exam. Mint’s Krishna Yadav and Devina Sengupta report.\n\nSoumya Rajan, chief executive of Waterfield Advisors, has strategically diversified her investment portfolio, which includes equity, debt, real estate investment trusts (REITs), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), and funds of funds that invest in venture capital and private equity.Mint Money’s Neil Borate writesabout how over the past year, Rajan has shifted her focus from small-cap to large-cap stocks due to concerns about overvaluation in smaller company stocks. She has also increased her investments in REITs and InvITs, seeking stable yields from these assets. Her portfolio adjustments reflect a cautious approach to market volatility and an emphasis on capital preservation. Rajan's firm, Waterfield Advisors, manages about ₹45,000 crore in assets and is exploring fresh equity funding from global family offices.\n\nThat's all for this week, I hope you have a pleasant weekend!\n\nIf you have feedback, want to talk about food, or have anything else to say about our journalism, write to me atsiddharth.sharma1@htdigital.in or reply to this mail.

Viswanathan,[18] publicly announced their team name – the Texas Super Kings, logo and coach for the first time.[19] However, it was announced in late April that they had revamped their logo for it to look similar to the logos of the Chennai and Joburg Super Kings.[20]\n\n2023 season[edit]\n\nPrior to the launch of the official season, it was announced the MLC's inaugural domestic draft would take place on March 19, 2023.[21] The Super Kings had the final pick of the first round draft and selected Rusty Theron,[22] before adding Sami Aslam, Calvin Savage, and Milind Kumar with later selections.[23] In June 2023, the Super Kings announced seven of their nine overseas signings, including Ambati Rayudu, Devon Conway, and Dwayne Bravo. In addition, they announced their full support staff lineup, including Albie Morkel and Eric Simons, among others.[24] They subsequently announced that former South African skipper, Faf du Plessis, would captain the side[11] and on July 5, selected Mohammad Mohsin as their Domestic Wildcard Pick.[25]\n\nRayudu withdrew from the tournament following the Board of Control of Cricket in India's proposal of a year-long \"cooling-off period\" for recently retired players[26] and his place taken by Imran Tahir.[27]\n\nIn the opening match of the tournament on July 13, the Super Kings recorded a 69-run win over the Los Angeles Knight Riders.[28][29] This was followed by a 6-run defeat to the Washington Freedom in their second match,[30][31] a 17-run victory over MI New York[32] and an 8-wicket defeat to the Seattle Orcas.[33][34]\n\nA three-wicket win over the San Francisco Unicorns ensured a top-two finish going into the playoffs,[35] but losses to both Seattle and New York saw the team eliminated.[36][37]\n\n2024 season[edit]\n\nAhead of the start of the 2024 season on July 5,[38][39] on February 15, 2024, the Super Kings released a list of retentions for overseas players, including captain Faf du Plessis, Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner.[40][41] During the domestic players' draft, the Texas Super Kings selected Joshua Tromp and Raj Nannan.[42][43] Outside of the draft, the team announced a series of overseas signings from New Zealander Daryl Mitchell to Australian Marcus Stoinis.[44][45] Mitchell however, following an injury, was ruled out of the season and was replaced by Afghan cricketer Noor Ahmad.[46]\n\nCurrent squad[edit]\n\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\n\nTexas Super Kings roster Position Name Nationality Date of birth (age) Batting style Bowling style Year signed Notes Batters Faf du Plessis South Africa (1984-07-13) July 13, 1984 (age 39) Right-handed Right-arm leg-break 2023 Direct signing, captain Milind Kumar United States (1991-02-15) February 15, 1991 (age 33) Right-handed Right-arm off-break 2023 Saiteja Mukkamalla United States (2004-04-09) April 9, 2004 (age 20) Right-handed Right-arm off-break 2023 U23 player All-rounders Calvin Savage United States (1993-01-04) January 4, 1993 (age 31) Right-handed Right-arm fast 2023 Zia Shahzad Pakistan (1996-06-18) June 18, 1996 (age 28) Right-handed Right-arm legbreak 2023 Dwayne Bravo West Indies (1983-10-07) October 7, 1983 (age 40) Right-handed Right-arm medium fast 2023 Direct signing Mitchell Santner New Zealand (1992-02-05) February 5, 1992 (age 32) Left-handed Slow left-arm orthodox 2023 Direct signing Marcus Stoinis Australia (1989-08-16) August 16, 1989 (age 34) Right-handed Right-arm medium fast 2024 Direct signing Aiden Markram South Africa (1994-10-04) October 4, 1994 (age 29) Right-handed Right arm off-break 2024 Direct signing Aaron Hardie Australia (1999-01-07) January 7, 1999 (age 25) Right-handed Right arm medium-fast 2024 Direct signing Cameron Stevenson United States (1992-10-30) October 30, 1992 (age 31) Right-handed Right arm fast-medium 2023 Raj Nannan West Indies (1994-09-14) September 14, 1994 (age 29) Left-handed Slow Left arm Orthodox 2024 Daryl Mitchell New Zealand (1991-05-20) May 20, 1991 (age 33) Right-handed Right-arm medium 2024 Ruled out due to injury Wicket-keepers Devon Conway New Zealand (1991-07-08) July 8, 1991 (age 32) Left-handed Right-arm medium 2023 Direct signing Joshua Tromp United States (2005-04-01) April 1, 2005 (age 19) Right-handed Right arm medium 2024 Drafted Bowlers Mohammad Mohsin Pakistan (1996-04-15) April 15, 1996 (age 28) Left-handed Left-arm leg break googly 2023 Domestic Wildcard Pick Zia-ul-Haq Pakistan (1994-12-11) December 11, 1994 (age 29) Right-handed Left-arm fast-medium 2023 Naveen-ul-Haq Afghanistan (1999-09-23) September 23, 1999 (age 24) Right-handed Right-arm medium-fast 2024\n\nDirect Signing\n\nNoor Ahmad Afghanistan (2005-01-03) January 3, 2005 (age 19) Right-handed Left-arm unorthodox 2024\n\nDirect Signing\n\nAdministration and support staff[edit]\n\nTexas Super Kings staff[47] Position Name Head coach Stephen Fleming Assistant coach Eric Simons Assistant coach Albie Morkel Team manager Russell Radhakrishnan Strength and conditioning Greg King High performance analyst Lakshmi Narayanan Physiotherapist Tommy Simsek\n\nPerformance[edit]\n\nStandings[edit]\n\nYear League standing Final standing 2023 Second Semifinals\n\nC: champions\n\nRU: runner-up\n\nSF team qualified for the semi-final stage of the competition\n\nSeason summary[edit]\n\nYear Played Wins Losses Tied/NR[a] 2023 7 3 4 0 Source: ESPNCricinfo[48]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nChennai Super Kings\n\nJoburg Super Kings\n\nReferences[edit]",

    "body": "How the American Cricket Market Can Leverage Opportunities to Draw High-Profile Players\n\nPat Cummins, Australia’s Test and one-day captain, recently made headlines by joining the San Francisco Unicorns in the emerging Major League Cricket (MLC) competition. Despite earning $3.67 million in the IPL, Cummins’ decision to play in the MLC, where players can earn up to $300,000 for a season, was driven by more than financial gain.\n\nCummins saw an opportunity to build relationships with some of America’s most successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. The San Francisco team’s lead investors, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, both Stanford-educated entrepreneurs, played a pivotal role in securing Cummins’ involvement.\n\nThis strategic move highlights the unique selling points that the American cricket market can leverage to attract high-profile players and enhance the commercial appeal of cricket in the U.S.\n\nTech-Savvy Collaborations and Networking Opportunities\n\nOne of the primary attractions for Cummins was the potential to develop deep relationships within Silicon Valley. This region is home to top companies and venture capital firms, offering players like Cummins unparalleled networking and learning opportunities.\n\nCummins’ manager, Neil Maxwell, emphasized this aspect: “He’s a very curious bloke and finds learning about these things really interesting. There’s a range of people connected to this franchise, including CEOs of major companies. It just opens up Silicon Valley.”\n\nThis unique angle can be a major draw for other international players who are looking beyond their cricket careers and want to explore opportunities in technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nEnvironmental Initiatives and Social Impact\n\nAdditionally, Cummins’ involvement with the Unicorns aligns with his environmental advocacy. The opportunity to connect with the tech community in Silicon Valley and engage with California’s green initiatives resonated with his aspirations beyond cricket.\n\nNick Cummins, CEO of Cricket Victoria, who facilitated the signing, noted, “This is so much more than cricket. It’s a chance to connect with the tech community, and align with his work for Cricket for Climate.”\n\nBy emphasizing the broader impact and opportunities for social engagement, the MLC can attract players who are passionate about making a difference off the field as well.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Market Positioning\n\nThe American cricket market can strategically position itself by forming partnerships with tech hubs and promoting the holistic benefits of playing in the MLC. Highlighting the potential for players to network, learn, and engage with leading tech entrepreneurs can significantly enhance the league’s appeal.\n\nMoreover, leveraging the influence of successful entrepreneurs and integrating environmental and social initiatives can create a compelling narrative that attracts both players and fans. This approach not only boosts the commercial lure of cricket in America but also positions the MLC as a forward-thinking and innovative league.\n\nPat Cummins’ decision to join the San Francisco Unicorns underscores the potential for the American cricket market to attract high-profile players through strategic, tech-savvy collaborations and social impact opportunities. By leveraging these unique selling points, the MLC can enhance its commercial appeal and build a robust and dynamic cricket market in the U.S.\n\nThis strategic focus on technology and social impact aligns with Ministry of Sport’s commitment to providing authoritative and engaging insights into the business of sports, inspiring our community to innovate and thrive in the sporting industry.",
    "summary": "* Australian captain Pat Cummins has joined the San Francisco Unicorns in the MLC, despite earning less than he did in the IPL, due to the opportunities to build relationships with successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.\n* The MLC can attract high-profile players by offering unique benefits such as tech-savvy collaborations, networking opportunities with top companies and venture capital firms, and social impact initiatives that align with players' values.\n* The league can position itself as a forward-thinking and innovative league by highlighting these benefits and forming partnerships with tech hubs.\n* Cummins' involvement with the Unicorns also aligns with his environmental advocacy, and the MLC can attract players who are passionate about making a difference off the field.\n* The MLC can enhance its commercial appeal by leveraging these unique selling points and building a robust cricket market in the US.",

Mitchell's franchise, the Texas Super Kings, have replaced him by signing talented Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad.\n\nMitchell, who was one of the prized overseas signings for Texas ahead of the second MLC season, had been in poor form and was suffering from injuries over the past year. He managed just 36 runs in three innings at theT20 World Cup 2024 as the Blackcaps crashed out of the marquee event in the group stage.\n\nThe 33-year-old had previously missed games for the Kiwis due to a foot injury which ruled him out for the second Test against South Africa in February.

    "body": "New Zealand’s star batter Kane Williamson has made a significant decision, stepping down from the T20I and ODI captaincy while declining a central contract for the 2024-25 season.\n\nKane Williamson prioritizes family and overseas cricket leagues\n\nThis move prioritizes both his desire for more time with family and the pursuit of an overseas cricketing opportunity.\n\nNotably, he is set to be picked by a top team at the SA20 and might also feature in the upcoming Major League Cricket (MCL) in the USA.\n\n“Helping push the team forward across the formats is something I’m very passionate about and something I want to keep contributing towards,” Williamson said in a New Zealand Cricket (NZC) release. “However, pursuing an overseas opportunity during the New Zealand summer means I’m unable to accept a central contract offer.”\n\nWilliamson open to accept the central contract in future\n\nDespite this decision, Williamson remains committed to representing New Zealand and accepting a contract in the future.\n\n“Playing for New Zealand is something I treasure, and my desire to give back to the team remains undiminished,” he said. “My life outside cricket has changed, however. Spending more time with my family and enjoying experiences with them at home or abroad is something that’s even more important to me.”\n\nThis announcement follows a less-than-stellar T20 World Cup 2024 campaign for New Zealand, where they failed to reach the semifinals for the first time since 2014. Williamson remained unclear about his future in T20Is, stating, “On, I don’t know. We’ll see where things land,” when asked about his involvement in the 2026 edition.\n\nBy choosing a casual contract, Williamson will receive a retainer while in the camp with the Black Caps, along with the usual match fees. He is expected to be available for most Tests, potentially missing only the September match against Afghanistan in India (which lacks World Test Championship significance).\n\nThe Black Caps’ forthcoming schedule includes tours of Sri Lanka (Tests and ODIs) and India, followed by a home series against England starting in November. Williamson will likely miss the white-ball matches against Sri Lanka before rejoining the team for the home season opener.",

    "date": "Thu Jun 20 13:56:35 2024",
    "body": "The upcoming Major League Cricket (MLC) season faced an early setback as New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell was sidelined due to injury. Mitchell, a key overseas signing for the Texas Super Kings, has been struggling with form and fitness in recent times. His stint at the T20 World Cup 2024 was lackluster, managing only 36 runs across three innings as New Zealand exited the tournament in the group stage. The 33-year-old's troubles extended back to earlier injuries, including a foot injury that forced him to miss the second Test against South Africa in February. His return to cricket thereafter saw him struggle to regain his peak performance, evident in his underwhelming performances for the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL. In light of Mitchell's unavailability, the Texas Super Kings swiftly made a move by signing Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad as his replacement. Ahmad, known for his spin prowess, joins the franchise with expectations to bolster their squad ahead of the MLC season.\n\nMitchell's absence poses challenges for Texas, who had pinned hopes on his all-round abilities. Despite his recent setbacks, Mitchell's experience and potential were seen as valuable assets for the team. However, his recurring injuries and subpar performances necessitated a strategic change, prompting the franchise to opt for Ahmad as a replacement. As the MLC season approaches, the Texas Super Kings will rely on Ahmad to fill the void left by Mitchell, hoping the Afghan spinner can make a significant impact and contribute positively to their campaign.\n\nFollowing Daryl Mitchell's need for rehabilitation, the Texas Super Kings have turned to 19-year-old Noor Ahmad as his replacement. The left-arm wrist spinner boasts international experience, having featured in 10 T20 Internationals for Afghanistan where he has claimed seven wickets with an economy rate of 7.00. Noor Ahmad has also made his mark in various T20 leagues including SA20, ILT20, and IPL, accumulating 97 wickets from 96 matches with impressive figures of 5/11. Currently, he is part of Afghanistan's squad at a major tournament, showcasing his burgeoning talent and potential.\n\nMitchell's absence presents a significant challenge for the Texas Super Kings, who had planned around his contributions alongside key players like former South African captain Faf du Plessis, and New Zealand duo Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner for the upcoming MLC season. Despite this setback, the franchise has found solace in the acquisition of Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis. Recently crowned the top-ranked T20I all-rounder, Stoinis adds substantial firepower to Texas' already formidable batting lineup.\n\nWith Noor Ahmad stepping into Mitchell's role, Texas anticipates his youthful energy and spin expertise will complement their squad dynamics effectively. The team's strategy now pivots towards integrating Ahmad seamlessly into their plans, leveraging his talent to maintain competitiveness throughout the MLC season.\n\nTexas Super Kings Squad",

Among the domestic players selected was Aaron Jones, the vice-captain of Team USA.\n\nAaron Jones (PTI Photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: The Domestic Supplementary Draft for Major League Cricket ( MLC ) took place on June 18, finalizing the rosters for the upcoming second season, set to commence on July 5. Among the domestic players selected was Aaron Jones , the vice-captain of Team USA.\n\nWith the immense popularity of the T20 World Cup and the success of the American team, three MLC teams--Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, and Seattle Orcas--had an available roster spot, allowing undrafted domestic players the chance to secure a place in the forthcoming tournament.\n\nThe supplementary draft order was randomly determined on June 18, and the teams were allotted a 48-hour window to strategize and conclude any internal discussions before proceeding with their picks.\n\nThe domestic supplementary draft selections were as follows:\n\nLA Knight Riders - Chaitanya Bishnoi\n\nA top-order batsman and spin bowler, the 29-year-old played for the Chennai Super Kings championship side in 2018 before moving to the United States to pursue his cricket in early 2023. He was a part of the San Francisco Unicorns squad in the 2023 inaugural season of Major League Cricket, featuring in all five matches for the Bay Area side.\n\nHe was also a key member of the Dallas Xforia Giants during the 2023 edition of Minor League Cricket.\n\nSeattle Orcas - Aaron Jones\n\nJones finds himself back in a recognizable locker room, as he was part of the Orcas squad during the first season of Major League Cricket last year. The opening batsman has been instrumental in Team USA's impressive run in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Throughout Team USA's unprecedented World Cup journey, Jones has been making waves and was a key player in the USA's remarkable victory against Pakistan in Texas. The Orcas faithful will be eagerly anticipating more of the same from Jones during the MLC season.\n\nMI New York - Sunny Patel\n\nSunny Patel, a versatile cricketer who bats right-handed in the middle order and bowls leg spin, made a significant impact during the 2023 Minor League Cricket season. His all-round skills were instrumental in propelling the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers to the Championship match, although they ultimately suffered a defeat against the Dallas Mustangs. As MI New York prepares for the 2024 season, Patel brings a unique dimension to their domestic player contingent. He stands out as the sole domestic leg-spinner on their roster, offering a valuable asset to the team's bowling arsenal.\n\n\"Major League Cricket plays a critical role in developing domestic players and providing a pathway to play cricket at the highest level amongst some of the best players in the world. We are thrilled to welcome Chaitanya, Aaron, and Sunny to the 2024 MLC season, adding three more talented domestic players to our league,\" said Major League Cricket Tournament Director, Justin Geale as per a MLC release.\n\nThe highly anticipated second season of MLC is set to kick off on July 5, featuring a thrilling opening match between the defending champions MI New York and the Seattle Orcas at Morrisville, NC. Following this clash, the Texas Super Kings will face off against the LA Knight Riders at Grand Prairie Stadium, TX.\n\nGiven the overwhelming success and packed stadiums of the inaugural season, cricket enthusiasts are advised to secure their tickets well in advance to avoid disappointment. Fans can choose from various ticket options, with general admission tickets starting at an affordable price of $30 per person, ensuring accessibility for all.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "date": "Thu Jun 27 16:38:35 2024",
    "body": "The Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) board has announced the introduction of a new rule in the upcoming Lanka Premier League (LPL 2024), which brings in additional powerplay overs for the batting side.\n\nThe LPL 2024 season will span from July 1 to 21, clashing heavily with the Major League Cricket in the United States. The latter will feature more well-known international players; the LPL has generally failed to draw global talent despite the money on offer, but it is popular among local fans.\n\nThe tournament’s fifth season, the LPL 2024 will feature 20 league matches between five franchises, followed by three playoffs and a final. Each team will play each other twice during the league stage before four of the five teams advance to the playoffs.\n\nDambulla Sixers, a new club, is one of the teams. The Dambulla team’s ownership shift was announced earlier this month, after Sri Lanka Cricket was forced to cancel the previous franchise due to one of its co-owners, Tamim Rahman, being arrested by Sri Lanka authorities under the Prevention of Offences Related to Sports Act.\n\nWhat is the ‘Power Blast Overs’ rule in LPL 2024?\n\nThe Lanka Premier League organizers will introduce a new feature dubbed ‘Power Blast Overs’ to add more aggression and excitement to a specific portion of their league. The feature is intended to include a special powerplay in the latter part of both innings.\n\n“The Lanka Premier League 2024 will introduce an exciting new feature with the addition of a special power play towards the latter part of each innings. This innovation, named ‘Power Blast Overs,’ will provide each team with a two-overpower play during the 16th and 17th overs of their innings,” SLC said in a statement.\n\nThe newly introduced Power Blast Overs feature will be used in the 16th and 17th overs of each innings. During this phase, a team will be allowed to field only four fielders outside the 30-yard circle, rather than the typical five outside the first six overs.\n\n“This new power play will be in addition to the traditional power play that occurs during the first six overs of an inning. During the ‘Power Blast Overs,’ only four fielders will be allowed outside the circle, thus creating a more aggressive and thrilling phase of the game,” the statement added.\n\nOn the new feature, Tournament Director of the LPL 2024 Samantha Dodanwela said, “We decided to bring this innovation in order to create further excitement for the league, which is growing year by year. This new introduction is sure to generate a lot of excitement among the fans, and the teams will need to strategize effectively to make the most of this period.”",
    "summary": "* The Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States will take place from July 1 to 21, coinciding with the Lanka Premier League (LPL) 2024 season.\n* The MLC will feature more well-known international players compared to the LPL.\n\nNote that there is no additional information about the MLC tournament in the article beyond these two points, as the primary focus is on the Lanka Premier League (LPL) 2024.",

    "title": "Will the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 help cricket finally take off in the US?",
    "date": "Sat Jun  1 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Is cricket really coming to the United States?\n\nThe game has long desired to conquer the land of dreams, and it won’t get a better shot at finally making it big.\n\nAs the United States hosts 16 matches of the latest ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, there are high hopes that cricket can finally make significant inroads in a lucrative and populous market.\n\nThe stars have seemingly aligned: Following the T20 World Cup, the second edition of the privately run Major League Cricket franchise tournament will bring some of the game’s biggest stars to the US and, in 2028, cricket will feature at the LA Olympics for the first time since 1900.\n\nHowever, cricket in the US has a history of poor governance, riven by factions and financial mismanagement. The sport’s growth has been hampered by the country’s sheer size and diversity of cricket cultures – factors also considered potential strengths.\n\nHere’s the lowdown on cricket’s history in the US and a peek into its future:\n\nIs there an existing cricket culture in the USA?\n\nWhen USA and Canada meet in the opening match on June 1, there will be plentiful reminders that these two countries played the first international cricket match in 1844, when Canada won the two-day fixture.\n\nBut the game took a backseat until the latter half of the 20th century when increased immigration – particularly from the Indian subcontinent – saw the game grow – with little cohesion – in communities from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh as well as the Caribbean.\n\nDoes USA have a cricket board?\n\nA national governing board, the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA), was formed in 1965 but it struggled to unify the diverse and siloed cricket communities for the next three decades.\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC), at times, implemented sanctions – withdrawing USA from tournaments, withholding funds and suspensions – all of which failed to overcome the fundamental issues.\n\nIn 2017, the USACA was expelled from the ICC.\n\nSo who’s in charge now?\n\nA new governing body, USA Cricket (USAC), was formed in 2019 and the USA was officially back in the ICC’s fold as an associate member. There was a new board and a new constitution, but the underlying problems of geography, culture and power struggles remained.\n\nThe following year, after extensive research on potential expansion markets, the ICC identified the USA as the game’s most desirable target. This was largely down to its size, economy, broadcast market and the existing cricket infrastructure and culture.\n\nWho is running the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup?\n\nThe decision to host T20 World Cup fixtures in the US was merely the first step in a long-term strategy.\n\nThe inclusion of the US in the West Indies’ successful bid to host this year’s tournament presented a golden opportunity to expand the sport’s profile but USA Cricket was in no position to facilitate a major event.\n\nIn October 2022, the ICC installed its own local organising committee – T20 USA Inc – to oversee the event.\n\nWhat’s wrong with USA Cricket?\n\nIn the five years since its inception, USA Cricket has had minimal and – at times – no full-time staff. It has instead relied on a mix of temporary contractors, consultants and volunteers.\n\nIt has been issued multiple sanctions by the ICC and – in 2022 – its funding was temporarily suspended.\n\nIt is currently operating without a CEO.\n\nThe selection process for the T20 World Cup squad was mired in controversy and excluded numerous eligible players.\n\nThe head coach, former Australian international Stuart Law, wasn’t appointed until mid-April.\n\nHow good is USA’s T20 World Cup squad?\n\nOn the field, the team has had an encouraging build-up, trouncing Canada 4-0 and defeating Bangladesh 2-1 in bilateral T20 series.\n\nThose results are astonishing considering USA had not played a T20 International since the World Cup qualifiers in July 2022. Since USA Cricket was admitted, the national men’s side has played just seven T20Is outside qualifying events. Since the start of 2022, they have played a total of twelve T20Is. By comparison, Nepal has played 36 in the same period.\n\nHave things improved since the US was announced as the co-host?\n\nThe publicly available minutes of USAC board meetings show that off-field conflicts continue to boil over.\n\nIn the lead-up to the biggest cricket tournament ever held on US soil, there have been squabbles over the constitution, allegations of racial discrimination and disagreements on the process of choosing a new CEO.\n\nA lawsuit filed by two directors against five fellow directors and a former CEO was dropped in 2022, but in 2023 another lawsuit was filed against USAC by former USA captain and league director Sushil Nadkarni.\n\nAt the most recent board meeting on March 27, Chair Venu Pisike “reaffirmed that board members MUST conduct themselves professionally and stop interrupting the board proceedings and being disrespectful to fellow board members”.\n\nHow might cricket grow after the T20 World Cup?\n\nAmid concerns about USAC’s governance, the ICC is forging ahead with plans to create a lasting legacy from the T20 World Cup. Profits from the matches held in Nassau County (New York), Broward County (Florida) and Grand Prairie (Texas) will be funnelled into cricket’s growth in the US.\n\nICC’s game development programme, Playground to Podium, aims to reach one million children – half of them female – by the 2028 LA Olympics, and regional development manager for the Americas, Fara Gorsi, is confident of success.\n\n“By the time we reach the LA Games it will be flourishing in all three cities as a minimum,” Gorsi told Al Jazeera. “And [it] will create a framework that will then be deployed across the states.\n\n“If we want to see a different community grow cricket in the USA it has to come organically through schools, through new leaders, new communities, parents, teachers.”\n\nGorsi says the complexity of the US sporting system requires a targeted and flexible approach in each district as the ICC rolls out resources, initially in the three host cities, to develop facilitators and coaches via an entry-level training programme called Criiio. There are long-term plans to permeate the college system, a key for any sport in the US.\n\nIs there a way to improve the situation?\n\nThe ICC has expressed concerns to USAC and has given them a July deadline to appoint a CEO. They can apply sanctions of varying severity but pressure will also be applied by the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC).\n\nTo become certified as cricket’s national governing body, USAC will have to meet USOPC’s rigorous criteria and standards.\n\nAs for the legacy programme, the ICC has not yet discussed a timeframe or mechanism for any possible future handover of the development programme and its funding to USA Cricket. Gorsi hopes it will eventually happen but admits there are significant barriers to overcome.\n\n“Without wanting to sound disrespectful, they’ve held it on to like it’s their sport,” said Gorsi.\n\n“If we grow it organically we’ll grow faster. We need to take the shackles off and allow it to be fun and have that accessibility across the country.\n\n“Once we break some of those barriers down and allow the US audience to be part of this wonderful game that we all love, I think it will spread like wildfire.”",

    "date": "Sat Jun  1 19:55:00 2024",
    "body": "In the United States of America, a country where people think of cricket as a version of baseball, it is important to understand if the ICC T20 World Cup would be successful or not.\n\nHowever, over the past decade, domestic T20 leagues have taken the cricketing world by storm, transforming the sport from a backyard hobby to a global phenomenon.\n\nAs such in the US, the shortened and quick version of cricket has been gaining popularity little by little.\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC), the US equivalent of the Indian Premier League (IPL), will launch after the World Cup.\n\nUSA Cricket, the ICC's representative organisation for the US, had chosen MLC as its exclusive partner in 2019 to create a professional T20 Cricket League.\n\nIn an effort to propel the USA men's and women's teams to the pinnacle of international competition, the MLC currently also offers assistance to both groups.\n\nThe MLC has been instrumental in providing the much-needed impetus to take cricketing in this region of the world to new heights. The top tier of domestic T20 cricket in the USA was introduced in 2019 with the MLC.\n\nThis has given American cricket players, who are primarily immigrants, a professional platform and high-calibre competition to draw spectators. In 2023, the MLC burst onto the scene, reshaping the American cricket landscape. For the first time, the United States witnessed world-class domestic T20 cricket, captivating audiences with electrifying matches.\n\nBut how would the success of MLC be attributed to?\n\nFirstly, the league would unite some of the top cricket players in the world, giving them a platform where they would display their abilities and dazzle spectators with amazing shows. In addition to drawing in an entirely novel generation of cricket fans, this celebrity influence would improve the game's general standard.\n\nSecondly, it is impossible to overstate the commercial attractiveness of the MLC. The league would serve as a fertile field for rich sponsorship agreements, television rights, and product sales. The MLC attracted numerous sponsors and franchises from other T20 leagues around the world in its inaugural season which was held in 2023. After making an impact in the inaugural season in July 2023, the MLC has got tech giant Cognizant as their title sponsor for the 2024 edition.\n\nIn 2023, each team's total salary cap was $1.15M for the tournament, putting MLC amongst the elite T20 global leagues in terms of player compensation per match.\n\nBesides, Minor League Cricket is the only nationwide tournament involving the strongest male players playing against each other at the best available facilities, with almost all of the players selected in the 2023 MLC Domestic Player Draft. It is important to mention that the Minor Cricket League was introduced in the United States in 2021 to develop the 'gentleman's game' into more of a popular sport in the country.\n\nThis year, immediately following the World Cup, all six of the teams that participated in the MLC's historic debut season will return. Superstars from Afghanistan, Pakistan's Haris Rauf (San Francisco Unicorns), South Africa's Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings), Marco Jansen (Washington Freedom), and Quinton de Kock (Seattle Orcas), as well as Sunil Narine (LA Knight Riders) of the West Indies, have already been confirmed to compete.\n\nBangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan has been signed as well by the LA Knight Riders for the second season of the tournament. The MLC's games will be held in Grand Prairie Stadium, which is close to Dallas, Texas. The 7,200 seats in this recently refurbished cricket-specific stadium exceed the highest international accreditation standards for a grass wicket.\n\nFor Americans who love cricket, MLC co-founder Vijay Srinivasan has promised the 'best summer of cricket'.\n\nBeing a trailblazer in USA cricket broadcasting, Srinivasan has long questioned why not a single game played on USA soil was shown on his platform. That compelled him to establish the concept of MLC. After everything fell into place, Srinivasan made the decision. In order to develop a rich talent pool of players to support Minor and Major League Cricket in the US, the MLC is developing international-calibre stadiums, establishing elite junior academies, offering top-notch training facilities and creating high-performance paths.\n\nWith its six clubs and backing from well-known figures in the USA and Indian corporate worlds, the MLC was considered by observers to have all the makings of a successful league last year. ABC, NBC, CBS, and The New York Times are among the major American news networks that have taken an interest in the MLC. According to the league's statistics, it has 40 million views, 3 million likes, and 3 million comments on social media already.\n\nIn conclusion, MLC has transformed cricket in the USA by bringing unprecedented excitement, global appeal, and opportunities for young players. The Major League Cricket and the Minor League Cricket redefined the way the game is played and watched, captivating audiences with their explosive matches and star-studded lineups. As the popularity of MLC continues to soar, the power and significance in shaping the sport's evolution in the USA cannot be underestimated.",
    "summary": "**Introduction of MLC:** The Major League Cricket (MLC), similar to the Indian Premier League (IPL), will launch in the US after the ICC T20 World Cup.\n\n**Background:** MLC was chosen by USA Cricket in 2019 as its exclusive partner to create a professional T20 Cricket League. The top tier of domestic T20 cricket in the USA was introduced in 2019 with the MLC.\n\n**Success Factors:** The success of MLC can be attributed to two main factors: (1) uniting top cricket players, giving them a platform to showcase their skills and attracting new fans, and (2) its commercial attractiveness, with sponsorship agreements, television rights, and product sales.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n* The MLC's inaugural season was held in 2023, with a total salary cap of $1.15 million per team.\n* The league has attracted sponsors and franchises from around the world, including tech giant Cognizant as its title sponsor for the 2024 edition.\n* Minor League Cricket, introduced in 2021, is a nationwide tournament that develops the game in the country.\n* All six teams from the inaugural season will return, featuring international stars like Faf du Plessis, Quinton de Kock, and Sunil Narine.\n* The MLC's games will be held at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas, a cricket-specific stadium with 7,200 seats.\n* The league aims to develop a rich talent pool of players, establishing elite junior academies, and creating high-performance paths.\n\n**Impact:** MLC has transformed cricket in the USA, bringing excitement, global appeal, and opportunities for young players.

The talismanic Aussie batter won't play in the American T20 League this year due to the Ashes, but is reportedly weighing up a move to the States once he finishes his Test career.\n\nSmith has a second home in New York and a connection to the Big Apple.

USA is the co-host for one of the biggest sporting events in the world along with the Caribbean and it will also be a test of the International Cricket Council (ICC) trying to take the game deeper into the markets where cricket is not the first sport. The first big step from the ICC was to sanction a T20 League (Major League Cricket) and then make USA the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup and then build a modular stadium in New York to get the American public closer to the action.\n\nWith T20 World Cup, the second season of the MLC and a new Legends League (Legends Intercontinental T20 League) scheduled to be held in the USA, there is a systematic plan to slowly get the American public introduced to the sport.

But now it’s a reality. And that tells you about the growing impact of the sport in the world and the United States is more than willing to accept the change and be probably the first ones on a global scale to accept it, in a way, with the World Cup,\" Kohli said in a video shared by US Consulate.\n\n“I think it’s a great start. It’s the ideal way to begin and it’s going to have a huge impact, and in starting off a kind of a domino effect. I hope it carries on for a long period of time,” he added.\n\n“We have enough people from our regions to keep the game up and alive in the States and make the others more aware about what it feels like to play and watch cricket. And I think it’s got great potential, with the MLC as well. There is already franchise cricket happening there. So I think, it’s moving in the right direction,” Kohli further said.",

    "body": "United States of America (USA) Cricket has made a huge mistake before the start of the much-awaited T20 World Cup 2024, which is set to be played from June 1 to June 29. The United States of America didn't mention the match between the USA and Canada as the inaugural game of the upcoming T20 World Cup.\n\nCricket's popularity has been gradually increasing in the United States of America over the past few years. Major League Cricket (MLC), a professional T20 league, commenced last year in the country. The franchise cricket league attracted cricketers from international teams, starting a new era for cricket in the country.\n\nLauderhill, Florida, New York, and Dallas will host the World Cup matches in the United States. Dallas and Lauderhill will each host four matches in the ICC event. The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York will host eight matches, including the much-anticipated India-Pakistan match on June 9.\n\nOn June 3rd, this venue will host the inaugural game of the 2024 T20 World Cup between Sri Lanka and South Africa - USA Cricket\n\nThe USA Cricket Board mistakenly announced Sri Lanka-South Africa as the inaugural match of the 2024 T20 World Cup instead of the USA-Canada match. The board stated that co-hosting the World Cup signifies a new hope for cricket in the United States.\n\n\"The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium was unveiled May 15th, marking it as a historical moment in USA Cricket history. On June 3rd, this venue will host the inaugural game of the 2024 T20 World Cup between Sri Lanka and South Africa. USA co-hosting this prestigious ICC event heralds a new hope for cricket in the states,\" the statement read.\n\nThe T20 World Cup will begin with the host nations playing their opening matches in early June. The USA will take on Canada in the tournament opener at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Dallas on Saturday, June 1. The West Indies will face Papua New Guinea at the Guyana National Stadium on June 2.\n\nThe top two teams from the four groups will advance to the Super Eight stages of the tournament. The United States of America will not host any matches in the Super Eight and knockout matches, including the semi-finals and the final. The Kensington Oval in Barbados will host the summit clash on Saturday, June 29.\n\nThe Sport's Popularity Decline Due To The World Wars - USA\n\nThe statement highlighted the historical relationship between cricket and the USA. The USA board noted cricket's presence in the US since the 18th century but acknowledged its decline due to factors like world wars and societal changes.\n\n\"Cricket and the USA have had a long-standing friendship without either party fully committing to a formal union. The ardor and fervor in this connection mirrored the climate in many regions of the country, which was frigid during the winter and scorching during the summer. The history of cricket in the United States can be traced back to the 18th century. However, the sport’s popularity declined due to the world wars and other civil upheavals,\" the statement further added.",
    "summary": "* Major League Cricket (MLC) is a professional T20 league that commenced last year in the United States, attracting international cricketers and starting a new era for cricket in the country.\n\nNote that there is no further information about the MLC tournament in the provided article, as the main focus is on the 2024 T20 World Cup and the history of cricket in the United States.",

Ahmed is also the owner of America's largest cricket complex (Prairie View Cricket Complex) located on the outskirts of Houston, housing five turf-wicket grounds on its premises.\n\nThe closure of these investment rounds is a major shot in the arm for this cricket 'start-up'. As part of their deal with USA Cricket, MLC is under obligation to deliver six world-class cricket stadiums. Notably, MLC is under exclusive negotiating agreements with respective city governments in the greater Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco Bay area to construct multi-million-dollar cricket stadiums.\n\nThe procurement of funds in rounds A and A1 will add to the enterprise's financial muscle to materialise the deals presently under negotiations. MLC has already entered into a long-term lease for Airhogs Stadium near Dallas and is expected to start revamping the stadium for cricketing use this summer.\n\n\"The significant funding committed by an outstanding group of investors will allow Major League Cricket to build first-class facilities and accelerate the sport's development across the country, bringing world-class professional cricket to the world's largest sports market,\" said Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, co-founders, Major League Cricket in a statement.\n\n\"This investor group comprises leading business executives and successful tech entrepreneurs who have led some of the world's most prominent companies.

    "body": "US cricket is rising. After beating Pakistan and pushing India, the Americans have reached the last eight of the T20 World Cup. On Sunday, they play England.\n\nThe success comes at a time of vast growth for American cricket. The US, the co-host of the tournament, launched a professional league last year and added T20 cricket to the 2028 Olympics in LA.\n\nLong regarded as an oxymoron, cricket in America is being powered by serious financial backers. Its domestic championship, Major League Cricket, has secured investment from the CEO of Microsoft and the owners of four teams from the Indian Premier League, cricket’s sporting and commercial behemoth.\n\nAmerican cricket might only be emerging, but it is already a threat to the game in England. The US league clashes with the English season, and many stars – English and foreign – are choosing to play in America over Albion.\n\nLast year, World Cup winner Jason Roy exchanged his England contract for one in Major League Cricket. Sunil Narine, Surrey’s star overseas player, missed T20 Finals Day because he was playing for the LA Knight Riders. This month Pat Cummins, the captain of the Australian teams that won the One-Day World Cup and the World Test Championship, signed a four-year contract with the San Francisco Unicorns. Jos Buttler, the England One-Day and T20 captain, is also interested.\n\nThe worry for English cricket is that, financially, it won’t keep pace. The English teams, almost all owned centrally or by members, could struggle to match the wages Major League Cricket can offer the world’s best players. The pound, which has still not recovered from Brexit, remains weak against the dollar.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) currently has full control of the English summer, which allows it to manage players’ workloads and make strategic decisions to bolster the England team. But if cricket in the US flourishes, the ECB will almost certainly be forced to take private investment (probably from India) to keep salaries competitive. Such a financial model would imperil English cricket’s foundations.\n\nAmerican cricket has a lot of work to do, especially in infrastructure. The 34,000 seater stadium on Long Island (bigger than any ground in England) is only temporary, and its wicket and outfield were dreadful. And yet, as I queued for the shuttle after South Africa versus Netherlands, the Yanks in front of me – newcomers to this queer sport – were trying to buy more tickets.\n\nMainstream US culture is slowly catching on. The World Cup has been covered by the major TV networks and newspapers (even if the New York Times, rather unconventionally, reported that India had beaten Pakistan 119-113). There was even a note of congratulation to the US team issued by the White House.\n\nCricket won’t quite conquer the US – the country is too big, and the sports market too flooded – but it doesn’t need to sweep all aside to be a success. To undermine the English summer, cricket in the US only has to succeed in certain pockets of the country, among certain demographics. The South Asian diaspora in the US stands at over five million. That’s roughly equal to the total population of a major cricketing nation like New Zealand, and not far short of the countries in the West Indies.\n\nMajor League Cricket will include more matches next year, increasing the conflict with the English season. American cricket’s ties to India have brought rumours that the US could host an additional season of the Indian Premier League every year. That would draw even more of the world’s best players (including English ones) away from both domestic and international matches held in England.\n\nThe success of the T20 World Cup has fast-tracked this expansion. On Sunday, England and the US will compete in the last eight. After that, they’ll compete to control summer cricket.",
    "summary": "* Major League Cricket, the domestic championship of the US, has secured investment from the CEO of Microsoft and owners of four teams from the Indian Premier League.\n* The league has already attracted top players, including Jason Roy, Sunil Narine, and Pat Cummins, who have chosen to play in America over England.\n* The financial backing of Major League Cricket is a threat to English cricket, as it can offer higher wages to the world's best players, potentially luring them away from the English season.\n* The league plans to increase the number of matches next year, which will clash with the English season, and there are rumors that the US could host an additional season of the Indian Premier League every year, drawing even more top players away from England.\n* The success of the US team in the T20 World Cup has fast-tracked the expansion of American cricket, and the growth of Major League Cricket is likely to continue, potentially undermining the English summer.",

    "date": "Sat Jun 22 15:23:50 2024",
    "body": "The Major League Cricket (MLC) has completed its Domestic Supplementary Draft, filling the remaining roster spots for the upcoming season. Team USA’s Aaron Jones, Chaitanya Bishnoi, and Sunny Patel were the three lucky players selected. The draft comes after a successful inaugural MLC season and on the heels of Team USA’s impressive performance in the ongoing T20 World Cup.\n\nJones Back with the Seattle Orcas\n\nTeam USA vice-captain Aaron Jones secured a familiar spot with the Seattle Orcas. Jones, a top-order batsman, was a key player for the Orcas in the inaugural MLC season. His recent heroics with Team USA in the T20 World Cup, including a crucial performance in the historic win over Pakistan, undoubtedly influenced the Orcas’ decision.\n\nFans in Seattle can expect more of the same high-octane batting displays from Jones throughout the upcoming MLC season.\n\nChaitanya Bishnoi Joins LA Knight Riders\n\nLA Knight Riders opted for Chaitanya Bishnoi, a 29-year-old top-order batsman and spin bowler. Bishnoi boasts an impressive cricketing background, having played for the Chennai Super Kings in the 2018 Indian Premier League (IPL) before moving to the United States in 2023.\n\nHe quickly made his mark on American cricket, featuring in all five matches for the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural MLC season and playing a pivotal role for the Dallas Xforia Giants in Minor League Cricket last year. Bishnoi’s versatility with both bat and ball promises to be an asset for the LA Knight Riders.\n\nMI New York Welcomes Sunny Patel\n\nRounding out the draft picks is Sunny Patel, who joins the MI New York roster. Patel, a right-handed middle-order batsman and leg-spinner, impressed in the 2023 Minor League Cricket season. His all-around performance was instrumental in leading the New Jersey Somerset Cavaliers to the Championship match.\n\nPatel brings a unique skill set to MI New York, becoming their sole domestic leg-spinner for the upcoming season, adding variety to their bowling attack.\n\nEnthusiasm for Domestic Talent\n\nMajor League Cricket Tournament Director, Justin Geale, expressed his delight at the selection of these talented domestic players. “We are thrilled to welcome Chaitanya, Aaron, and Sunny to the 2024 MLC season,” Geale said in a press release. “Major League Cricket plays a critical role in developing domestic players and providing a pathway to play cricket at the highest level.”\n\nThe second season of MLC kicks off on July 5th with a doubleheader. Reigning champions MI New York will face the Seattle Orcas in Morrisville, North Carolina, followed by the Texas Super Kings taking on the LA Knight Riders in Grand Prairie, Texas. With sell-out crowds witnessed during the inaugural season, MLC is encouraging fans to secure their tickets early for the upcoming season. Ticket options cater to a wide range of budgets, with general admission starting at $30.\n\nThe excitement extends beyond the on-field action. Fans can expect a vibrant atmosphere with entertainment, fireworks, giveaways, player meet-and-greets, merchandise opportunities, food trucks, and more throughout the tournament. With the addition of these talented domestic players and a focus on fan engagement, the second season of Major League Cricket promises to be an exciting one.",

More such venues are on the way.\n\nGrand Prairie’s 7,200-seat stadium is home to the Texas Super Kings, one of the six teams that played in the U.S.’ Major League Cricket during its inaugural season last year. About 50,000 people attended games during the two-week season and postseason, Grand Prairie City Manager Bill Hills told The New York Times.\n\nInvestors are increasingly interested in the growing audience for cricket, the world’s second-most-popular sport, which has an especially large South Asian audience, the NYT reported. Major League Cricket franchises the San Francisco Unicorns, the Los Angeles Knight Riders and the Seattle Orcas and their backers are all moving toward building new venues within the next few years.\n\nThe turnout to a dozen cricket games in Grand Prairie last year exceeded expectations, Hills told the NYT. The three-day playoffs in July generated $1.7M in economic activity, including hospitality, retail, dining and entertainment, he said.\n\n“Who would have thought a city like Grand Prairie would host international sporting events” watched by millions, Hills told the NYT.\n\nGrand Prairie in 2020 greenlighted plans to turn its former minor league baseball venue into the first Major League Cricket stadium in the country, hoping to capitalize on the 15 to 20 million cricket fans who were already estimated to be in the U.S.\n\nTwo years later, a group led by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gave Major League Cricket $120M to fund the construction of stadiums and training centers and host global cricket events in the U.S. over the following decade.\n\nThat vision is now coming to life as Major League Cricket zeroes in on building more 7,000-to-10,000-seat stadiums in areas that could bloom into entertainment districts, the NYT reported.\n\nCricket stadiums make a great anchor to attract people, David Demarest, who leads the sports and entertainment development group at JLL, told the NYT. That was part of the vision in Grand Prairie.\n\n“No question it is going to be something that can serve as a springboard to development. It is located in an opportunity zone,” Marty Wieder, former Grand Prairie director of economic development, said in 2022.\n\nThe city planned to draw on the 100,000 or so Indian American people living in DFW.\n\nAbout 250,000 people originally from India or elsewhere in South Asia live in the San Francisco Bay Area, Unicorns General Manager David White said of a proposed stadium in the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds. The Santa Clara site also hopes to attract a Major League Soccer stadium and more to become a sports and entertainment hub, the NYT reported.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas plan to build a stadium at Marymoor Park in Redmond, Washington, near Bellevue, and the Los Angeles Knight Riders are eyeing a spot at the Great Park in Irvine, California.\n\nVijay Srinivasan, a Bay Area entrepreneur who founded a cricket pay television channel, told the NYT the lack of cricket infrastructure in the U.S. is the main thing holding it back from hosting the most competitive games.\n\nEven so, Major League Cricket’s short season allowed many of the sport’s top players, including Australia's Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Pat Cummins, to play in the U.S. league last year.",

The London-based outfit is one of the eight teams competing in The Hundred.\n\nThe IPL franchises are associated with a number of T20 leagues across the globe. They have teams in the Caribbean Premier League, Major League Cricket, ILT20 as well as SA20. And they could soon have their own teams in England as well.\n\nMark Nicholas revealed the IPL franchises' plans while announcing the plans for the World Cricket Connects symposium at Lord's. The ace commentator is set to take over as London Spirit's chairman in October this year. Recently, MCC CEO Guy Lavender wrote a letter to the club members to seek their approval for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)'s offer to privatize a 49 percent stake in the Spirit.\n\nWhile Nicholas did not reveal the names of the IPL franchises, he made it clear that they are interested in associating with The Hundred. The stakeholders will be finalized through a bidding process while the remaining 51 percent will remain with the franchise.\n\n\"What we are putting to a vote is to accept the ECB’s offer of a 51% share of this franchise,\" Nicholas told ESPNCricinfo.\n\n\"We will always be a members’ club. The first target is membership harmony [because] as a member you are entitled to a view. It’s very easy to knock people back because they’re difficult, but actually there is quite a lot of good thinking that comes out of activism. You have to treat people with respect, and hear their view,\" he added.\n\nThe Hundred has given us another opportunity: Mark Nicholas\n\nThe ECB is planning to privatize the Hundred. The board is planning to privatize the competition by creating eight new companies and gifting 51% of the shares in them to the relevant host county. The remaining 49 percent will be sold to private investors through a bidding process.\n\nNicholas highlighted how the ECB missed out on T20 cricket and India capitalized on it by launching the highly successful IPL. He further stated that The Hundred has given the ECB another opportunity to make amends.\n\n\"We missed out on T20 in 2003 where we could have grabbed it,” said Nicholas. \"India thought quicker than us (on the IPL) and were smarter than us, as India often is. India moves at an extraordinary pace to make things work.\n\n\"So the Hundred has given us another opportunity. The [MCC] membership quite likes being part of the chat, not being consigned to a piece of history. The members I talk to really love the idea of having a team, love the opportunity that it brings. There will be financial opportunity, either in growth of the equity or in sale of the equity,\" he added.",

He averaged just 24.78 in eight Test innings in which he split, despite hitting a hundred and the experience of a couple of ducks.\n\n“We typically support players pursuing opportunities outside the Australian season where the international schedule, playing loads and fitness allows.

    "date": "Sun Jun  2 18:00:47 2024",
    "body": "Location. Weather. Facilities. People. In four words, you have the summary of why Texas has become the hub of cricket in America.\n\n“It’s not even a question,” says USA player and Texas resident Andries Gous. “It’s 100% Texas. Whether it’s tournaments, games, camps or whatever it is that’s being held - it’s in Texas.”\n\nGous himself was born and raised in South Africa but joined the many players from around the world who moved to the USA with the advent of Major League Cricket. At first he lived in Seattle before making the move to the Lone Star State, and in particular, to Dallas.\n\n“I definitely moved for the stadium,” says Gous, talking about Dallas’s Grand Prairie facility, which will host four matches during this World Cup, including the opening fixture between USA and Canada. “I can practise at the stadium and there’s now outdoor nets being built. The facilities are just better in Dallas at the moment.\n\n“I’m a bit different to the other guys because I play tournaments outside the country, so I need some proper facilities throughout the year. Other people [elsewhere in the United States] will be stuck indoors whereas I can train outdoors [in Texas], which is what I need.”\n\nFor players, Texas represents the result of a “build it and they will come” philosophy. Dallas and Houston both now have infrastructure that attracts players domestically and from overseas. In the last year alone, more than a dozen cricketers, both international and domestic, have moved to one of the two cities.\n\nBut that doesn’t completely answer why the venue was built there in the first place.\n\n“We looked all over the country,” explains Justin Geale, tournament director for MLC, who have leased and developed the Grand Prairie facility in Dallas, completed less than a year ago.\n\n“The original thought was that it’s probably easier to convert a baseball stadium,” he says. The search for one such was extensive. “I’d be surprised if there’s a Minor League stadium in the country that’s closed or for sale that we didn’t know about.”\n\nIndeed, Grand Prairie was formerly home to the Texas AirHogs baseball team, who folded in 2020 following the Covid-19 pandemic. MLC saw the opportunity and convinced the local government of the value of a new stadium on the site.\n\nThe city of Grand Prairie owns the stadium and MLC has an exclusive lease to it. All the upgrades that have taken place, at a cost of US$21 million, have been funded by the investors and teams within MLC.\n\nThe actual site had enough space for a renovated stadium to be built, and practice facilities are now being added immediately outside it. But beyond that, Texas itself was an attractive location due its central location in the US (only three or four hours by flight from most places in the country), its climate, and a large South Asian diaspora.\n\n“The location is really important,” Geale explains. “It’s about 15-20 minutes from Dallas-Fort Worth airport, so it’s in a really accessible spot in a major city in Texas. Also, the weather means you can play around ten months of the year. So there’s an awful lot going for it from a geography standpoint, and also a demographic standpoint.”\n\nA key part of US cricket’s recent history involves Vijay Srinivasan and Sameer Mehta, co-founders of American Cricket Enterprises, which operates MLC, and crucially, are also co-founders of Willow TV, a 24x7 cricket channel in the US that broadcasts all major cricketing events in the country. Using their subscriber data allowed them to pinpoint where in the US would be best suited to building the nation’s cricketing hubs, which, unsurprisingly, were areas with large South Asian populations.\n\n“That was one of the things we looked at when allocating markets and thinking where this might work,” Geale says. “It’s a pretty expensive business so it makes sense to go for lower-hanging fruit, which is people that love the game, to start with, and building out from there.”\n\nDallas already boasted a number of indoor facilities, and it is estimated that there are over 1000 juniors playing cricket in the area. Furthermore, a Sixes Social Cricket bar is situated just north of the city, one of only two locations outside the UK where the cricket-themed bar has a venue.\n\n“I don’t think people know actually how much cricket there is in this country,” said Gous in an interview with the Washington Freedom franchise last summer. “It’s ridiculous. Everywhere in the country there’s cricket. If you want to play 12 months a year, you’ll find it.”\n\n“Until four or five years back,” says Dhandapani Devarasan, the head coach of the Dallas-based Mustang Cricket Academy, “many parents asked me what is the future of cricket here. Now, no one is asking.”\n\nMustang is owned by Lovkesh Kalia, who moved to the area in 1999. “When I arrived, we had eight teams and we all knew each other,” he reminisces. “Now there are probably more than 200 games being played every weekend. It’s amazing. And there are grounds popping up everywhere.\n\n“Literally the other week two new grounds came up, and now Celina is putting up two grounds. Prosper is putting up two grounds,” he says, referring to two towns north of Dallas. “And the reason they’re doing it is because they’ve figured out that South Asians migrate and cricket is very, very important to them. And there’s been a tremendous amount of migration in those places north of Dallas, so the cities are putting up cricket grounds. Before we had to beg them. Now they’re saying, ‘We have a cricket ground for you. Come down here.’ The growth has been tremendous.”\n\nWhile the growth has been exponential, the sport, at a recreational level at least, remains one that is played almost exclusively by the South Asian diaspora. According to Kalia, 99% of children playing in Dallas are of South Asian heritage. The question is whether that matters. After all, America is a massive country with a population of 335 million. And while those with Indian heritage make up just 1.4% of that figure, that’s 4.5 million people - only about 500,000 fewer than the population of New Zealand.\n\nAs such, the US boasts a passionate but diluted fan base that is spread across a country the size of a continent. But now, with children who are second- or third-generation Americans growing up and playing the sport their parents knew and loved, it is burgeoning and excelling in specific locations. Comparisons or questions about whether cricket will become the new baseball are lazy ones. It never has been, nor will it ever be the goal to make it that.\n\n“It’s such a big market, but I think we need to tap that community first,” Geale says. “But I genuinely do think there is an opportunity to grow a wider base because I don’t think you want to become just known as a sport played by immigrants. I think it’s probably taken Major League Soccer 20 years to shake that tag and become more mainstream. I think we need to tap that. We can go after new fans as well. But yeah, to say we’re going to be Major League Baseball is ridiculous.”\n\nThe plan now is for the USA national team to base themselves at Grand Prairie in the near future. There have also been discussions with English counties about the prospect of pre-season training camps being held in the city. But the ultimate aim is for Dallas to be the location where teams touring the West Indies add a handful of fixtures on to the end or start of a tour to play a strong US national team.\n\n“We’re building a high-performance centre,” says Geale. “And players really enjoy their time here. It’s a great place to bring the family and the golf clubs.",

Ahead of the second season of the league, the Australian skipper has been signed by the San Francisco Unicorns franchise.

With Cummins’ signing, it is expected that he will lead the side.\n\nPat Cummins set to lead San Francisco Unicorns\n\nDue to his workload, Cummins has not preferred to play much league cricket since 2019. He last played in the BBL in 2019, and since then, the IPL has been the sole league where he has participated. Now, Major League Cricket has been added to his schedule. MLC 2024 will kick off on July 6 (IST), and this window won’t witness much international cricket, as the T20 World Cup will conclude a week prior to MLC’s start.\n\nSince becoming Australia’s Test captain in 2021, Pat Cummins has been on a successful journey. During his tenure, Cummins has won The Ashes, the ICC World Test Championship, and the ICC World Cup. Recognizing his prowess as a skipper, he was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for a whopping 20.5 crore rupees. He performed brilliantly in the IPL 2024 season, leading SRH to a runner-up finish. Now, the San Francisco-based franchise has also placed their trust in him.\n\nHow did the San Francisco Unicorns fare in MLC 2023?\n\nLast season, under Aaron Finch’s captaincy, the team finished in 5th place in the 6-franchise tournament. The Unicorns won 2 of their 5 league games and missed out on the playoffs due to a low run rate. The current roster of the Unicorns features many star players, including Corey Anderson, Haris Rauf, Jake Fraser-McGurk, and Josh Inglis.

The 31-year-old ICC Men’s Cricketer of the Year and Wisden’s Leading Cricketer in the World for 2023 is already lauded as an all-time great fast bowler and will be a game-changing addition to the Unicorns roster for the 2024 season.\n\nIn an MLC first, the fast bowler, who also captains IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad, has signed to the Unicorns for a four-year period, offering the team and league a significant vote of confidence as it looks to build out the franchise’s popularity with success on the pitch and the development of its cricket stadium in the Bay Area.\n\nWith pace bowling expertise set to complement the Unicorn’s fast bowling attack, which already features international class in Pakistan’s Haris Rauf and New Zealand’s Matt Henry, Cummins has shown himself to be a handy lower-order batter in the short format of T20, once holding the IPL record for the fastest to fifty runs, taking him just 14 balls.\n\n“I’m very excited to join the Unicorns ahead of the 2024 season,” said Cummins. “MLC is developing at a rapid rate, and the US market potential is huge for cricket.”\n\nThe Unicorns are co-owned by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Anand Rajamaran and Venky Harinarayan, who have shared a number of successful tech ventures, most notably founding and selling database technology provider Junglee, which was sold to Amazon in 1998 for $250m.\n\n“While cricket is integral to my involvement, the global network and long-term possibilities offered by the owners specifically, and Silicon Valley more broadly presented a unique opportunity for me and my life beyond cricket,” added Cummins.\n\n“Anand [Rajaraman] and Venky [Harinarayan] operate in a business world that excites me enormously and I can’t wait to be a part of it.”\n\nThis latest signing comes after MLC recently received List A status from the world cricket governing body, the ICC. The league is now regarded as an official T20 tournament, with playing records now counted towards official format statistics.\n\n“Pat Cummins has been one of the world’s great players across all formats for a number of years now and we are thrilled to welcome him to the Unicorns family,” said San Francisco Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman.\n\n“Pat’s commitment to a long-term contract demonstrates his faith in our vision for growing cricket in the Bay Area and more broadly across the US.

    "body": "The Australian skipper Pat Cummins is prepared for his next assignment in the USA for the upcoming season of Major League Cricket (MLC). The financial allure of the tournament is notable, with average players earning up to INR 2.5 crore for seven games and a couple of final matches. In comparison, Cummins earned approximately INR 1.8 crore per match during the recent IPL 2024 season.\n\nFor this MLC season, Cummins has been signed by the San Francisco Unicorns. The team’s lead investors, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, are ardent fans of Cummins, and their admiration goes beyond his cricketing prowess.\n\n“Of course, we’re huge fans of Pat Cummins and really wanted him to join the team, but what really helps us out is how tech-savvy and forward-thinking he is. He’s considering his career beyond cricket and is interested in the intersection of technology and cricket, even after his playing days,” Rajaraman told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nALSO READ: White House Applauds USA Cricket Team’s Historic T20 World Cup 2024 Performance\n\nThe alignment of interests in technology played a significant role in bringing Cummins to the Unicorns. The team has connections with prominent figures in the tech industry, including the CEOs of YouTube and Adobe, offering Cummins a unique opportunity to explore Silicon Valley’s innovative environment. Cummins’ manager, Neil Maxwell, emphasized this learning aspect as a major draw for the cricketer.\n\n“He’s a very curious individual who enjoys learning about new things. The range of people connected to this franchise, including high-profile tech CEOs, opens up Silicon Valley to him,” Neil Maxwell explained.\n\nAdditionally, the San Francisco Unicorns are supported by Cricket Victoria, while Cummins’ home state, New South Wales (NSW), backs Washington Freedom. The Unicorns’ investors approached Cricket Victoria’s chief, Nick Cummins, about the signing.\n\nALSO READ: Virat Kohli Prepares for Afghanistan Clash Amid Struggles; Possible Inclusion of Kuldeep Yadav\n\nNick clarified that while Pat is not seeking more cricket-playing opportunities, the chance to delve into Silicon Valley’s tech scene made the offer appealing. The move to the MLC not only broadens Pat Cummins’ cricketing horizons but also allows him to engage with cutting-edge technology and forward-thinking individuals, aligning perfectly with his post-cricket aspirations.",

After a thrilling super-over match against Pakistan, they emerged victors, positioning the team to finish second in Group A of the main event. In the end, they were fortunate that the weather forced the cancellation of their match against Ireland.\n\nCEO of Cognizant Major League Cricket Vijay Srinivasan said that moving the team to the next round of the home World Cup is an amazing accomplishment. The USA will play South Africa, the West Indies, and England in Group 2 of the Super 8 round.\n\n“Congratulations to Team USA, who, in their first-ever World Cup appearance, gave us three thrilling matches of cricket against the world’s best teams and earned their position in the Super 8. This is a historic moment for the sport, especially for our players from Major League Cricket who are representing the USA. We hope that this inspires boys and girls around the country to pick up a bat and ball this summer, and encourages sports fans to attend an MLC game or tune into the broadcast,” Srinivasan said as quoted by the MLC release.\n\n“The USA’s advancement to the Super 8 means they’ll automatically qualify for the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, providing Major League Cricket with a strong platform for continued growth,” he added.",

Seattle is the only small market franchise in MLC, but have ties with IPL franchise Delhi Capitals.\n\n\"Atlanta and Chicago...there's very, very strong communities in those markets that have been very passionate about cricket, so those would be very logical markets for us to be looking at,\" Srinivasan said.\n\n\"I think there's a list of about four or five (cities) that are being considered right now.\"\n\nA move across the border could also be on the cards although might be complicated with Canada boasting its own fledgling T20 league.\n\n\"Vancouver and Toronto has a history of being in U.S. sports. Do I expect Vancouver and Toronto (as part of an expansion)? Absolutely,\" Seattle Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar told me.\n\n\"Locations with potential in terms of expansion will have a cricket loving diaspora in larger cities. Houston is also a location that I could see probably having a team.\"\n\nSomasegar believed a greater depth of American talent needed to emerge before an expansion.\n\nAs I reported recently, teams in the upcoming season will be allowed six overseas players per starting eleven, which is more than the quota of four accepted in established leagues. It is believed MLC is targeting to comply with International Cricket Council regulations in the coming seasons.\n\n\"We need to build a larger cadre of domestic players,\" Somasegar said. \"We need to go figure out how we are going to continue to both cultivate and nurture existing domestic players, and really broaden the footprint for domestic players.\"\n\nForbesMajor League Cricket Enters Pivotal Second Season\n\nThe ultimate vision is for more teams, more games and a season lasting around six weeks from early June-mid July, helping to avoid clashing with the Hundred competition in the U.K.\n\nMLC officials and owners want a home-and-away season - where the teams play each other twice - to underpin the competition, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds.\n\nLike last year, the entire tournament will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina. There had been hope that New York's $30 modular stadium built for the ongoing T20 World Cup could host games in MLC, but that was not possible.\n\nForbesNew York Cricket Stadium Set To Cost $30 Million As Anticipation Builds For T20 World Cup\n\n\"We were very optimistic that we could use the infrastructure, but a variety of logistical reasons proved too difficult,\" Srinivasan said. \"Obviously a bit disappointing, we would have loved to bring MLC to the New York region, which has a team, and it would really have been a great way to jump start all of that.\"\n\nThe 34,000-seat stadium in Eisenhower Park in Long Island is already being torn down with the U.S. leg of the T20 World Cup complete. As I reported previously, discussions are being held over third party use of the facility post the tournament.\n\n\"If it is available next year and it is a viable venue, we would absolutely explore it,\" Srinivasan said.\n\nThe sheen of the New York spectacle marked by the sold-out India-Pakistan blockbuster coupled with underdog U.S.' stirring performances is hoped to carry momentum into a pivotal second season of MLC.\n\nForbesCricket T20 World Cup Hoped To Return To The U.S. Within A Decade\n\n\"What the World Cup is doing is bringing a lot of attention to this sport. I think we can ride the momentum,\" Srinivasan said.\n\n\"The World Cup will come and go. But we are here to stay.\"",
    "summary": "**Current Status:** The MLC has completed its inaugural season with 6 teams: Texas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C, Seattle, and New York.\n\n**Expansion Plans:** There is no specific timeline for expansion, but the MLC hopes to reach 10 teams in the long term, with Chicago, Atlanta, and Canadian cities (Vancouver and Toronto) being possible expansion locations. Houston is also considered a potential location.\n\n**Requirements for Expansion:** Before expanding, the MLC wants to develop a larger pool of American cricket talent and cultivate domestic players.\n\n**Season Structure:** The upcoming season will feature 6 overseas players per team, with a goal to comply with International Cricket Council regulations in the future. The ultimate vision is for a 6-week season from early June to mid-July, with a home-and-away format, but this will depend on all teams having their own home grounds.\n\n**Current Season:** The entire tournament will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina, with hopes to use the new modular stadium in New York in the future.\n\n**Outlook:** The MLC is riding the momentum from the T20 World Cup and hopes to build on its success in the second season, with a focus on developing American cricket talent and expanding the league in the long term.",

    "date": "Tue Jun  4 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "In a landmark move, Australia's Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins will feature in the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC). The 31-year-old fast bowler has signed with the San Francisco Unicorns, a franchise that maintains a strategic partnership with Victoria's first-class cricket setup in Australia. Cummins’ decision to participate in the MLC marks a significant step into the T20 franchise world, having recently led Hyderabad to the final of the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nCummins has been on a relentless cricketing journey since mid-February, juggling commitments between the Australian national team and the IPL. His MLC stint, commencing just five days after the conclusion of the World Cup, will cap off an intense period of cricket that began with Australia’s tour of New Zealand earlier this year. Cummins, renowned for his blistering pace, deceptive slower balls, pinpoint yorkers, and valuable lower-order batting, will undoubtedly bolster the Unicorns’ lineup. His presence is expected to be a game-changer, not only for the Unicorns but also for the overall talent pool of MLC players.\n\nStar-Studded International Signings\n\nCummins’ signing is part of a larger trend of high-profile international players joining MLC's six teams: Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, Washington Freedom, and San Francisco Unicorns. This wave of signings underscores MLC’s growing reputation as a premier T20 league.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders: Bangladesh's veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, South African power-hitter David Miller, Irish fast-bowler Josh Little, Indian wicketkeeper-batter Adithya Ganesh, and Afghani spinner Waqar Salamkheil.\n\nMI New York: West Indian all-rounder Romario Shepherd and South African fast bowler Anrich Nortje.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Alongside Cummins, Australian wicketkeeper Josh Inglis, emerging batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk, and hard-hitting West Indian Sherfane Rutherford.\n\nSeattle Orcas: Fast bowlers West Indian Obed McCoy, South African Nandre Burger, and Australians Nathan Ellis and Lance Morris.\n\nTexas Super Kings: New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell, South African T20 captain Aiden Markram, Australian all-rounder Aaron Hardie, and Afghanistan's speedster Naveen ul Haq.\n\nWashington Freedom: Batting talents Steve Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Jack Edwards, and New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra.\n\nHistorically, Cummins has been selective about participating in T20 franchise cricket, making his decision to join MLC particularly noteworthy. This move signals MLC’s growing stature and its ability to attract top-tier international talent. Cummins joins a cadre of fellow Australians, including Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith, and Jake Fraser-McGurk, who have signed on for MLC’s second season. Rumors also suggest that Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, and other members of Australia’s World Cup squad may also be heading stateside.\n\nThe second season of MLC begins on July 5 with an exciting doubleheader. Defending champions MI New York will face off against Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season’s finale in Morrisville. Later that day, Texas Super Kings will play their home game against the LA Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in the Dallas Metro area. Cummins’ participation in MLC not only enhances the league's competitive edge but also reinforces its position on the global T20 stage. As the MLC continues to attract cricket's biggest names, fans can look forward to an electrifying season filled with high-octane action and stellar performances.\n\nTune In",

As Australia's Test and ODI captain, how Cummins' availability for either assignment might be affected remains to be seen. He does not lead in T20I cricket, but recently captained his IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad to the IPL 2024 final.\n\nHard-hitting Australian batter Jake Fraser-McGurk will join Cummins at San Francisco Unicorns this season. Washington Freedom is another franchise that has signed a number of high-profile Australians, including Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Steven Smith. Washington also contracted New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra.\n\nOther high-profile MLC signings for 2024 include Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan and South Africa's David Miller to Los Angeles Knight Riders, South Africa's Anrich Nortje and West Indies' Romario Shepherd to MI New York, South Africa's Aiden Markram and New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell to Texas Super Kings, and South Africa's Nandre Burger and West Indies' Obed McCoy to Seattle Orcas.\n\nIn its second season, MLC will have List A status, the second Associate-run franchise competition to acquire it from the ICC after the UAE's ILT20.

    "body": "Australian fast-bowling superstar Pat Cummins has sent shockwaves through the cricketing world by signing a four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns, a franchise in the up-and-coming Major League Cricket (MLC) league in the USA.\n\nGame-Changing move for Pat Cummins and MLC\n\nPat Cummins’ decision is a significant one. He has rarely ventured outside the established leagues, previously only playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nHis absence from Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL) since 2018 due to international commitments highlights his focus on the highest level of cricket. However, the lure of the MLC and its future potential has proven irresistible for Cummins.\n\nBusiness Opportunities Beckon for San Francisco Unicorns\n\nIn a statement released by the San Francisco Unicorns, Pat Cummins expressed his excitement about the MLC’s growth and the vast potential of the US market for cricket. However, his motivations extend beyond the sport itself.\n\nThe “global network and long-term possibilities” offered by the franchise’s Silicon Valley-based owners are particularly enticing to Cummins.\n\nHe sees an opportunity to engage with the business world beyond his cricketing career and is eager to collaborate with the franchise’s co-owners, Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, who are prominent figures in the tech industry.\n\nInternational Cricket vs MLC Commitments\n\nThe MLC season runs from July 6th to 29th this year. This timeframe coincides with Australia’s scheduled tour of the West Indies in June-July next year, raising questions about Cummins’ availability for the international matches.\n\nAs Australia’s Test and ODI captain, his presence on that tour would be crucial. While the impact on his T20I involvement remains to be seen, Cummins recently captained the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL 2024 final, so a complete T20I absence seems unlikely.\n\nMLC boasts star-studded roster\n\nCummins joins a growing list of high-profile cricketers signing with MLC franchises. The San Francisco Unicorns also secured the services of Australian batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk.\n\nAnother MLC team, the Washington Freedom, boasts a strong Australian contingent with Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, and the legendary Steven Smith joining their ranks. This influx of international talent further strengthens the MLC’s position as a rising force in global cricket.\n\nMLC Gains Official Recognition from ICC\n\nThe MLC’s second season brings an exciting development: List A status. This prestigious designation, previously only held by the UAE’s ILT20 among Associate-run franchise competitions, recognizes the MLC as an official T20 league.

    "body": "Australian cricket superstar Pat Cummins is all set to make waves in the USA's Major League Cricket (MLC) as the latest high-profile signing for the next edition of the tournament after the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his Australian compatriots like Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Spencer Johnson, Steve Smith, and Jake Fraser-McGurk, Cummins is all set to make his MLC debut this season.\n\nAccording to Cricbuzz, Cummins, who led the Australian cricket team to victory in the World Test Championship Final and the ODI World Cup against India, has been signed by the San Francisco Unicorns for the second edition of the MLC 2024.\n\nPat Cummins to make MLC debut after stellar IPL 2024 campaign\n\nCummins is expected to fill the void left by Aaron Finch's retirement, as the Aussie speedster will be the new captain of the San Francisco Unicorns. Cummins, who led the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) to the IPL 2024 Final, will join forces with fellow Australians Matt Short and Jake Fraser-McGurk in the San Francisco Unicorns lineup for the upcoming MLC 2024.\n\nThis move added to an already grueling schedule for Cummins that commenced with Australia's tour of New Zealand in February 2024. It is being said that Australia’s T20I captain Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, and several Australians from their T20 World Cup 2024 squad are also expected to make entry to the three-week franchise competition in America.\n\nNotably, the Australian fast bowler recently shined as a captain on his debut IPL season. However, the SRH lost the IPL 2024 final to the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) last month, but Cummins' leadership credentials were praised highly by the former cricketers and cricket experts. He was also impressive with the ball for the SRH in the IPL 2024, taking 18 wickets.\n\nMLC 2024 to start next month in the USA\n\nWell, the upcoming MLC 2024 is scheduled to kick off on July 5 in the USA, just days after the conclusion of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2024. The MLC recently earned List-A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) and joined the ranks of elite Associate-run franchise competitions after UAE's International League T20 (ILT20).\n\nThe second edition of the MLC promises an enthralling start, with defending champions MI New York locking horns with runners-up Seattle Orcas at Church Street Park in Morrisville on July 5. The opening day festivities will feature a doubleheader, with the Texas Super Kings squaring off against the LA Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nNotably, the Australian cricket team is currently gearing up for the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024 in the USA and West Indies and Cummins is expected to play a crucial role in their campaign. Australia is slotted alongside England, Namibia, Oman, and Scotland in Group B at the 2024 T20 World Cup.",

He scored 94 runs in only 40 deliveries to help the USA start the T20 World Cup 2024 campaign on a positive note. He is hoping that his inning against Canada will open the eyes of those who don't know anything about him or USA cricket. Jones was released by Major League Cricket franchise Seattle Orcas after its inaugural edition. He was not picked in the last MLC draft.\n\nRead Also: Most Sixes in the T20 World Cup\n\nAaron Jones and Andries Gous led the USA to their victory against Canada\n\n\"When I wasn't selected in the Major League, I just took it as a stepping stone in the journey. I would have loved to get drafted, so it goes sometimes. Hopefully, tonight's innings will probably open the eyes of those who don't know me or USA cricket. We have great players here and we have a lot of talent here and are willing to play at the highest level for sure,\" Aaron Jones said after the game.\n\nUSA had a poor start and they lost the wicket of Steven Taylor for a duck in the second ball of the inning. They were 42/2 after 6.3 overs. But Jones played a counter-attacking inning and completed the chase with 14 balls to spare. He smashed 10 sixes in the game, the second most in a T20 World Cup inning after Chris Gayle's 11 against England in 2016.\n\nAndries Gous also played an important inning and was instrumental in USA's victory. He scored 65 runs off 46 balls and helped Aaron from the other end. Jones and Andries Gous stood tall and added 131 runs for the third wicket.\n\n\"I don't think it is easy to put it into words. We know Canada comes hard against us since it is a big rivalry. Happy to take the team over the line. Sometimes as a cricketer, you could go a bit under the radar if you have a few low scores. I always back myself and know that I am capable of performing at every level. Happy that I came out on top and won the game for the USA. Hope it opens the eyes of some people around the world that I am good enough to play T20 cricket. I believe in myself, I work hard and I just use it as motivation. I know that I'm good enough to play at the highest level, and whenever given the opportunity, I'll do my best for sure,\" Jones further added.\n\nUSA will next face Pakistan at the same venue on Thursday and play India in ten days, while Canada will face Ireland in New York on Friday. Jones said they will continue to play fearless cricket.",

It is worth noting that the youngster had been suffering from food poisoning in the lead up to the tournament and was eight pounds lighter when he made his MLC debut.\n\nHowever, overcoming his issues, the bowler managed to deliver a brilliant spell.

Out of all, I think he had taught me so many things which I didn't know much about cricket. We worked with the video analyst as well. There were so many match-ups that they had ready. So for someone like Faf, he likes to step out a lot. He kind of goes straight towards you. So I was asked to bowl at the wide line if I saw him step out. So if he slashes, it would balloon to the fielder placed there. Or even a slower ball,” Ugarkar was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz.",

Even at the age of 17, he was not as quick as he would have liked to be when he bowled in the NCA nets against players like Hanuma Vihari. But many years later, he’s managed to get into Major League Cricket, or MLC.\n\nUgarkar, who played for MI New York in the MLC, frequently reached early 130s in the two games he played for his team that season. It’s important to remember that the young athlete was eight pounds lighter when he made his MLC debut and had been experiencing food poisoning in the days before the competition.\n\nNevertheless, the bowler overcame his problems to produce an outstanding spell. He recently opened out about his thoughts on his time spent playing cricket for a franchise.\n\nRushil Ugarkar entered MI New York following his selection as the team’s rookie pick in the draft.\n\nAs the 21-year-old made his way into the team, he was surrounded by some of the best bowlers in the world, including Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and Anrich Nortje.\n\nHe discussed how working with Lasith Malinga, a former cricket player for Sri Lanka, helped him find his path and how it was the high point of his tenure with MI New York (MINY).\n\nProbably the best part was working with Malinga. I believe that he had taught me a great deal about cricket, about which I knew very nothing. We also collaborated with the video analyser. They have an incredible amount of matchups prepared. He therefore enjoys going out frequently for someone like Faf. He kind of moves in your direction. I was instructed to bowl at the wide line in case I witnessed him leaving. He would therefore inflate to the fielder positioned there if he slashed. or even a slower ball,” according to a quotation from Ugarkar.\n\nAlso Read: MLC 2024: Pat Cummins and the San Francisco Unicorns agree to a four-year contract\n\nAt the Ebenezer school in Bengaluru, Ugarkar was bench mates with Sanjay Krishnamurthy of the USA when he was younger.

The series marked his international debut and he also claimed wickets in the third match in Canberra. But a side strain amidst the series has kept him at bay.\n\nHe was to feature for the Seattle Orcas in Major League Cricket but the scans highlighted a hot spot in his back and he missed Australia’s ongoing white-ball tour to the United Kingdom. As the pacer is currently undergoing rehab, he admitted that the recuperation process has been \"frustrating\".\n\n\"It's been a bit frustrating. I guess you call it a stress fracture, but when we scan it, it doesn't have the natural characteristics of a usual stress fracture. So there was some confusion at first around exactly what it was,” said Morris as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.\n\nAlso Read: Nathan Ellis to miss Australia's UK tour with hamstring injury\n\n\"The tricky one for me was I didn't actually have any back pain when I was bowling.

Shehan Jayasuriya (24 in 27 balls, with three fours and a six) joined Quinton de Kock (26 in 19 balls, with two fours and a six), and the pair took control of the run chase. At the end of the powerplay, the Seattle Orcas were placed at 47/1.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya eventually fell to Calvin Savage in the seventh over after a 27-ball stint at the crease.

However, both batters were outfoxed by spinners and dismissed for single digits. Mitchell Santner saw the back of Klaasen, while Bracewell was trapped by Noor Ahmad.\n\nComing together with the score at 67/5 in 10.4 overs, Shubham Ranjane (16) and Keemo Paul (25 in 17 balls, with three fours) labored to keep the Orcas in contention. However, Ranjane was run out and Keemo Paul was castled by Noor Ahmad before the 17th over, comprehensively extinguishing the run chase. Ali Sheikh chipped in with a consolatory knock, but the Orcas fell well short, finishing at 140/9.Otneill Bartman took two wickets in the tail to finish with figures of 3/20.\n\nEarlier in the day. The Texas Super Kings lost openers Devon Conway (0) and Joshua Tromp (6) early in the innings, however, Faf Du Plessis (39 in 17 balls) was in fine form, smashing six boundaries and a six before he was scalped by Keemo Paul. At the end of the power play the Texas Super Kings were placed at 56/3.\n\nMilind Kumar (29 in 28 balls, with two sixes) played a watchful knock, scoring nearly a run-a-ball before he became Keemo Paul's second wicket of the day. The experienced all-rounders, Marcus Stoinis (11) and Mitchell Santner (15) both got starts, but failed to convert them into bigger scores, falling to Aryan Desai and Matthew Bracewell, respectively.\n\nCalvin Savage (45* in 27 balls, with six fours and two sixes) orchestrated the biggest partnership of the innings, joined by Cameron Stevenson, the pair put on 43 runs in just 23 deliveries in the final phase of the innings. Stevenson (17) struck a four and six to support Savage's late innings fireworks, but was cleaned by Nandre Burger in the 18th overs.\n\nSavage hammered Bracewell for two consecutive maximums in the 16th over and went on to script a 17 run over of Nande Burger's 18th over to remain unbeaten and help the Texas Super Kings finish at 177/8.\n\nBrief Scores\n\nTexas Super Kings 177/8 (Faf Du Plessis 39 off 17, Colin Savage 45* off 27, Keemo Paul 2/18, Ayan Desai 2/30) beat Seattle Orcas 140/9 (Quinton de Kock 26 off 19, Keemo Paul 25 off 17, Ottneil Bartman 3/20, Noor Ahmad 2/19 ) by 37 runs.\n\n—ANI",

    "body": "Legendary England pacer, James Anderson, is potentially targeting the Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States. This development comes after Anderson's recent retirement from international cricket and his interest in returning to white-ball formats.\n\nAnderson, who hung up his international boots in July 2024 after claiming an impressive 704 Test wickets, has been a key player of English cricket for nearly two decades. His retirement marked the end of an era in Test cricket, but the 42-year-old fast bowler might not be done with the sport just yet.\n\nAccording to a BBC Sport report, at least one MLC team has shown keen interest in Anderson following his optimism about a potential return to white-ball cricket. The franchise is reportedly exploring the possibility of bringing the pacer on board for the third edition of the T20 tournament in 2025.\n\nNotably, the MLC, launched in 2023, has already attracted several high-profile cricketers. Australian stars like Pat Cummins, Steve Smith, and Glenn Maxwell have participated in the league, lending it significant credibility. The tournament's expansion to 34 games in 2025 and its recent acquisition of official List A status shows its growing importance in the global cricket calendar.\n\nAlso Read: ‘Don’t know if there’s a better batter while chasing in history’ - James Anderson hails Virat Kohli\n\nI'm due to go to Pakistan and New Zealand in winter: James Anderson\n\nFor the former, a stint in the MLC could prove lucrative, with potential earnings of around 135,000 euros for a short period. This figure is particularly noteworthy when compared to the ECB white-ball contract of 70,000 euros that Jason Roy turned over to sign a 300,000 euros deal with the Los Angeles Knight Riders.\n\nDespite not having played competitive T20 cricket since 2014, Anderson believes he is still fit enough and good enough to compete in the format. Meanwhile, since his retirement, the pacer engaged himself in coaching the national team as England men's bowling consultant. He also extended his contract for the upcoming winter tours of Pakistan and New Zealand.\n\n\"At the minute, I'm due to go to Pakistan and New Zealand in the winter. Then nothing concrete after that. I'm very new to this, I'm still learning as we go. It's partly me trying to figure out if this is where I want to go with the next stage of my career and also for them to figure out if I'm any good at it as well,\" Anderson told Sky Sports.",

    "body": "In a move that’s stirring the cricketing world, James Anderson, England’s legendary fast bowler, is reportedly in the sights of a Major League Cricket (MLC) franchise. At 42, with a career that has seen him amass 704 Test wickets, Anderson’s potential venture into the MLC could mark a significant chapter not just for him but for cricket’s expansion in the USA.\n\nA New Frontier for James Anderson:\n\nHaving retired from international cricket, Anderson’s interest in the MLC reflects his enduring passion for the game. The MLC, aiming to popularize cricket in America, represents an exciting new challenge for Anderson, who has primarily focused on Test cricket over the past decade.\n\nFinancial Incentive:\n\nThe offer of 1.49 crore INR for a short stint underscores the financial allure of franchise cricket. For Anderson, this could be more than just money; it’s a chance to engage with cricket in a new format and environment, potentially extending his playing career or transitioning into a coaching role.\n\nImpact on MLC:\n\nAnderson’s involvement would undoubtedly elevate the MLC’s profile. His experience and skill could mentor younger players, enhance team strategies, and attract more fans and investors to the league, accelerating its growth trajectory.\n\nStrategic Move for Cricket in the USA:\n\nThe MLC’s ambition to expand to ten teams by 2025 indicates a strategic push towards making cricket a mainstream sport in America. Anderson’s participation could be a catalyst in this mission, bringing his expertise in swing bowling to conditions that might favor such skills.\n\nFan and Cricket Community Reaction:\n\nThe news has sparked a mix of reactions. While many celebrate Anderson’s willingness to explore new avenues, there’s nostalgia about his Test cricket days. However, his move could inspire a new generation of cricketers in the USA, showing that cricket careers can have multiple phases.\n\nChallenges Ahead:\n\nAnderson’s last T20 match was over a decade ago, which might pose challenges in adapting to the fast-paced T20 format. However, his cricketing acumen and fitness could well see him thrive, especially with the shorter format’s emphasis on strategy and experience.\n\nA Broader Perspective:\n\nBeyond Anderson’s personal journey, this move highlights cricket’s global aspirations. The MLC, with its growing stature, could become a significant platform for cricketers worldwide, offering opportunities for those looking to extend or transition their careers.\n\nJames Anderson’s potential stint in the MLC isn’t just about playing cricket; it’s about contributing to the sport’s growth in new markets, mentoring, and perhaps, discovering new talents. As the cricketing world watches, Anderson’s decision could set a precedent for how retired or retiring stars engage with the game’s future.\n\nThis development in Anderson’s career, if realized, could be a testament to his love for cricket, his adaptability, and his role in shaping the sport’s future landscape. Whether for the money, the challenge, or the love of the game, Anderson’s potential move to the MLC is more than just a career choice; it’s a statement on cricket’s evolving narrative.",

    "body": "Like some of their famous Bay Area sports counterparts, San Francisco Unicorns might just have an edge in Major League Cricket through proximity and close links to Silicon Valley.\n\nAhead of the recent second season, where they finished runners-up, the Unicorns landed the biggest signature so far in the fledgling American T20 pro franchise league.\n\nForbesChicago And Atlanta Could Be The Next Franchises In Major League Cricket\n\nStar quick Pat Cummins, Australia's Test and World Cup winning captain, signed a four-year contract with the Unicorns in a major boost for the credibility of the lucrative six-team competition hoped to stir interest in cricket in the world's biggest sports market.\n\nIt was initially seen as a surprising move from the 31-year-old Cummins, who does not play much franchise cricket due to his enormous international workload. He only plays in the money-spinning Indian Premier League, where his recent deal was $2.4 million, and rarely suits up in Australia's Big Bash League because of cricket's increasingly congested calendar.\n\nLike many of his compatriots, Cummins was lured to MLC. Not necessarily for the money - although the MLC does offer healthy remuneration in line with rival T20 leagues - or playing amid the bright lights of the American sports scene. But rather for exploring business interests, with Cummins attracted to the Unicorns in a bid to get a foot into Silicon Valley.\n\nThe Unicorns are the latest partnership between co-owners Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan. They were founding partners of early ecommerce company Junglee, which was acquired by Amazon in 1998 for $250 million. They also later founded Kosmix, which was acquired by Walmart, and were early investors in Facebook.\n\nForbesWhy A Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist Decided To Invest In America’s New Pro Cricket League\n\n\"That (Silicon Valley) was the reason we were able to get him,\" Rajaraman told me. \"We are a start-up league. The attraction to him is that it is easier way for him to get connected into Silicon Valley.\n\n\"He's interested in technology and start-ups and so on. He's already an investor in start-ups and he wants to expand that and connect into Silicon Valley. We've facilitated that and it was our promise to him to make that happen.\"\n\nWith perfectly manicured hair, and thick glasses that makes him look like Clark Kent when he's not playing Superman on the field, Cummins has been divisive for some of his compatriots due to his advocacy for climate change, a stance that Australia's dominant right-winged Murdoch media pile into him creating a certain perception.\n\nUnlike the traditional hard-bitten, beer-swigging, Australian cricketer, Cummins represents a more cultivated modern player that has smashed to bits stereotypes. Cummins took just four wickets from six MLC matches, but saved his best performance for the final when he dismissed compatriots Travis Head and Steve Smith.\n\n\"He's a fantastic guy, amazing human and very, very, very sharp,\" Ramarajan said of Cummins. \"So happy that we had him on the team and so happy that I got to spend some time with him.\n\n\"He's one of those guys, who just by his presence elevates the whole atmosphere of the team and it just lifts everyone.\"\n\nCummins' off-field attraction to the Bay Area is reminiscent of NBA superstar Kevin Durant's famous move to the Golden State Warriors in 2016.\n\nThe Unicorns have wisely decided to embrace Silicon Valley as an identity. Not just as a means of luring those wanting to expand their financial acumen, but also in the franchise's approach to analytics and AI to evaluate T20 cricket.\n\nForbesSan Francisco Unicorns Embracing Silicon Valley Identity As Major League Cricket Takes Off\n\n\"Silicon Valley is our brand,\" Ramarajan said. \"We used data and analytics quite significantly. We've been trying to push the envelope. Some of the success we had in assembling the team and decisions we made were backed by new data driven methods that we've been developing.\n\n\"That's all part of our Silicon Valley brand.\"",

    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC), the burgeoning T20 tournament in the USA, has achieved a significant milestone by acquiring List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) just before its second season. This achievement places MLC as the second Associate-run franchise competition to receive List A status, following the UAE's ILT20 earlier this year.\n\nThe elevation to List A status signifies a formal recognition of MLC as an official T20 league, with all tournament playing records now counted as official format statistics. Justin Geale, the tournament director, expressed enthusiasm about this development, highlighting the recognition of the tournament's high standards and the quality of players involved. He mentioned that this recognition would enhance the credibility of cricket in the USA on a global scale.\n\nGeale thanked the ICC for acknowledging MLC's unique position as an Associate nation, emphasizing the tournament's role in providing a platform for some of the world's best players to showcase their skills alongside their peers.\n\nMLC's 2024 edition is set to commence on July 5, immediately following the conclusion of the T20 World Cup on June 29 in Bridgetown. This timing marks a crucial period for cricket's efforts to establish a strong presence in the US market.\n\nIn addition to the List A status, MLC has unveiled plans for expansion, aiming to grow from six teams to 10 over the next few years. The number of games is also set to increase, from 19 in 2023 to 34 by 2025, with 25 games scheduled for the upcoming season.\n\nVijay Srinivasan, MLC's chief executive, outlined the league's vision for expansion and scheduling adjustments to avoid clashes with other prominent cricket events. He discussed plans to start the league earlier in June to coincide with the school holidays in the US, providing a favorable window for MLC's growth.\n\n\"It was always intended to be a 10-team league,\" MLC's chief executive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the Guardian. \"Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that's our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.\"\n\n\"Ultimately for us, our ideal calendar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,\" Srinivasan said. \"With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That's how we would like to establish our window.\"\n\nLast year, the MLC concluded just two days before the start of the Hundred. However, this time there will be a six-day overlap between the two leagues, with the MLC ending on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. Consequently, up to half of the overseas players in the Hundred may arrive in the UK late after the MLC ends. Twelve out of the 24 overseas players contracted in the men's Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in the MLC, and more may follow before the tournament begins.\n\nFour out of the six teams in the MLC are owned by IPL team owners: Mumbai Indians, KKR, Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals.",

    "body": "On the face of it, this should be a World Cup that suits South Asian teams. Pitches in the Caribbean have tended to be slow, in Guyana, Kingstown, and Antigua in particular.\n\nIf the trends seen in last year's Major League Cricket are any indication, surfaces in Dallas are likely to tend towards the slower side also. And in Lauderhill, Florida, only once has a team breached 190 in the six men's T20 Internationals played there this decade.\n\nBut this is a World Cup in which so little can be confidently predicted. So, few matches have been played in the three United States venues. Although drop-in pitches are being imported, and technically should play fairly evenly, there is no real telling how those tracks will fare in the particular climatic conditions that prevail in each of these venues, or how they will wear through the course of the tournament. New York is an especially tricky proposition. One month out, the stadium there is still being constructed.\n\nWith so much uncertainty about how the tournament will pan out, it could be the all-rounders in each squad that define teams' progress.\n\nWhen a side turns up at the ground and the track looks like there will be some seam early on [particularly in the morning matches, some of which start as early as 10:30am local time], captains would ideally like to have a high-quality seam-bowling all-rounder to boost the fast-bowling stocks, while compromising little in the way of batting.\n\nIf, mid-tournament, the pitches begin to change after several matches have been played on the same square, teams with spin-bowling all-rounders may find themselves in advantageous positions, in terms of picking their XI.\n\nMost South Asian sides have the spin-bowling all-rounder spot covered, of course. Bangladesh have Shakib Al Hasan, India have Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, Sri Lanka have Wanindu Hasaranga, Afghanistan have Rashid Khan, and Pakistan have Shadab Khan. So good is South Asia at producing spin bowlers that can bat, that all these players would likely make it into the team based only on their bowling.\n\nBut when it comes to seam-bowling all-rounders, South Asian sides tend not to have as high-quality a production line. Sri Lanka, for example, have Dasun Shanaka and Angelo Mathews in their squad. Both are batting all-rounders, and limited bowlers -- Mathews can be effective with the new ball when there is seam and swing on offer, but struggles in the middle overs, and cannot really bowl at the death except in extreme circumstances. Shanaka prefers bowling a quiet over in the middle, but has been in poor hitting form over the past year.\n\nIndia have Hardik Pandya, but he's coming off a rough IPL season, when for the first time in his career, he has faced the ire of India fans. Shivam Dube is also in the India squad, but at the international level, his bowling returns don't inspire a lot of confidence.\n\nPakistan are unlikely to pick any seam-bowling all-rounders. Afghanistan have the likes of Gulbadin Naib and Karim Janat. Again, these are players with only passable bowling statistics. Unlike the spinners, many of South Asia's seam-bowling all-rounders would not make the XI on one skill alone.\n\nUnusually for a World Cup year, there has also not been an Asia Cup. This year the IPL has imposed itself in the months leading up to the global tournament. Many have noted that the Impact Player rule in the IPL has seriously disadvantaged all-rounders. How India pivots back to a competition in which they cannot call on ultra-specialists to take care of specific passages in the game, remains to be seen.\n\nThe counter to this, of course, is that South Asia perhaps has the finest seam bowling cohort it has ever sent to a World Cup. Bangladesh have Mustafizur Rehman and Taskin Ahmed. Pakistan have Naseem Shah and Shaheen Afridi. Sri Lanka have their fastest seam-bowling battery ever -- Dushmantha Chameera, Dilshan Madushanka and Matheesha Pathirana all capable of breaching 145kph. India, of course, have the most valuable quick of them all, Jasprit Bumrah, as well as Mohammad Siraj, who is likely to prosper when movement is on offer.\n\nBut at a tournament that involves so much travel between time zones, such a diversity of venues, and a huge variety of teams, versatility is likely to be key. How well can you fine-tune your strategy for this particular match? All-rounders may be key to that.\n\nAndrew Fidel Fernando is a senior writer at ESPNcricinfo.",

    "date": "Mon May 27 13:01:00 2024",
    "body": "Synopsis\n\nCricket returns to North America through the T20 World Cup, aiming to capture local interest despite limited awareness. With 30 million U.S. fans, the ICC sees potential. The event sets the stage for cricket's 2028 Olympic comeback. Major League Cricket's launch and strategic marketing aim to expand the sport's U.S. presence.\n\nCricket, a popular pastime in the United States in the mid 1800s, makes a big-ticket return to North American shores through the T20 Word Cup but will it be able to leave an impression on the local audience that knows little to nothing about the gentleman's game? Cricket globally is driven by India but the International Cricket Council sees huge potential in the American market and claims there are already 30 million fans that follow the game in the massive country.\n\nThe T20 showpiece is also seen as a major stepping stone to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make a comeback after 128 years when the big event kicks off on June 1.\n\nA total of 16 games will be played across three venues -- New York, Dallas and Lauderhill -- with a majority of 55 matches scheduled in the Caribbean including the knock-outs.\n\nDay three of the competition will have South Africa and Sri Lanka battling it out in New York, where the first ever international cricket game was held between USA and Canada back in 1844.\n\nIt was a phase when the sport was played widely across America before a much faster alternative in Baseball gained prominence during the Civil War in the 1860s.\n\n\"...(T20) it's entertainment and that's what people look for. That's what Americans look for, you know, they want entertainment,\" says legendary West Indian Brian Lara, one of the most recognisable cricketers in the world but someone who admits that he could walk around Miami without getting a second look.\n\n\"You know, you speak to an American and I've done that many times and they'd say 'you play a game for five days and then you end up in a draw? What's that all about?' So it's, it is difficult,\" he explains the challenge of selling Test cricket to an American, who might just warm up to the shortest format though.\n\nA couple of weeks of international cricket in an alien land will not be enough to evoke long-lasting interest from the local audience and to ensure the game grows beyond the South Asian and Caribbean expat community, the stakeholders will need more time.\n\nFor a beginner, cricket can be rather complex to understand especially when one is introduced to \"third man\", \"fine leg\" or \"deep mid-wicket\", some of the terms used for the many field placements in the game.\n\nThe ICC is pulling out all stops to engage with the American audience, whether it is getting eight-time Olympic gold-winning sprinter Usain Bolt on board as the World Cup ambassador or promoting the event at the recent Formula 1 race in Miami.\n\nTo distract the average American household from the world of baseball, NFL and NBA, cricket will need to grow at the grassroots level.\n\n\"I surely think the game can grow in the USA. When you have presence in a country people start gravitating towards it and want to know more about,\" Bolt, who belongs to the cricket-loving Caribbean, told PTI in a recent interview.\n\nThe Americans have surely one reason to follow the event. Their team, mainly made up of players from South Asian and Caribbean heritage, will be making its World Cup debut.\n\nVenu Pisike, head of USA Cricket, reckons the ICC event will bring much-needed awareness around the game but eventually, it is the lure of taking part in the 2028 Olympics that will draw masses to the sport.\n\n\"So far, cricket is predominantly an expats' game, but with the marketing and promotion activities during the World Cup, there is some momentum and the World Cup will definitely boost the opportunities to expand the game in the USA,\" said Pisike.\n\n\"Definitely, the World Cup is bringing a lot of awareness and then the opportunity for cricket to be in the Olympics, that will definitely attract the community because the US is a huge sports country.\n\n\"Olympics is the prime area where all the sports bodies are focusing on since cricket is going to Olympics, that will actually give more opportunities to expand the sport between the World Cup and the Olympics,\" added Pisike.\n\nThe USA squad picked for the tournament makes up for a bunch of semi-professionals who rely on full-time jobs to run their families. That will have to change if the sport is to appeal to a broader audience in America, believes India-born USA squad member Nisarg Patel.\n\n\"Ultimately what needs to change in the USA is that an American kid in a high school needs to see a future in the game.

    "title": "Report: ICC Grants List A Status to Major League Cricket",
    "date": "Tue May 28 15:00:44 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket Gains List A Status from ICC\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) in the United States has taken a significant step forward by acquiring List A status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) ahead of its second season. This recognition places MLC alongside other official T20 leagues, affirming the quality and competitiveness of the tournament.\n\nEnhancing the Credibility of American Cricket\n\nJustin Geale, the tournament director, expressed his excitement about this development, noting that it acknowledges the high standard of players participating in the league. “By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale,” Geale told ESPNcricinfo.\n\nGeale emphasised the importance of this status for the players’ career statistics, ensuring their performances are officially recorded. This milestone is crucial for cricket’s growth in the US, an Associate nation with a unique opportunity to build a robust cricketing culture. Geale added, “It’s our hope that on the back of the upcoming World Cup and a successful season we can continue to build a platform for the sport to grow and ultimately succeed in the USA.”\n\nUpcoming Season and Expansion Plans\n\nThe 2024 edition of MLC is scheduled to begin on July 5, shortly after the T20 World Cup concludes on June 29 in Bridgetown. The T20 World Cup itself starts in Dallas, USA, on June 1, marking a pivotal season in efforts to popularise cricket in the US market.\n\nMLC’s plans for expansion are ambitious, with a vision to grow from the current six teams to 10 over the next few years. The number of games will also increase significantly, jumping from 19 matches in 2023 to 34 by 2025. Vijay Srinivasan, MLC’s chief executive, outlined this growth strategy to The Guardian, stating, “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan.”\n\nScheduling and Global Cricket Calendar\n\nThe league’s scheduling is strategic, aiming to find an optimal window in the crowded global cricket calendar. Srinivasan explained that the ideal start would be in early June, aligning with the end of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the start of school holidays in the US. This timing would avoid clashes with other major leagues like the Hundred and the T20 Blast.\n\nThis year, MLC will overlap with the Hundred by six days, with MLC concluding on July 28 and the Hundred starting on July 23. This overlap means that several overseas players contracted to the Hundred might join their teams late. Currently, 12 out of the 24 overseas players in the Hundred have commitments in MLC, indicating a significant crossover of talent.\n\nOwnership and Infrastructure\n\nFour of the six teams in MLC are owned by IPL franchises – Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals. This association with established IPL teams has helped MLC attract high-calibre players and gain credibility.\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC ran from July 13 to 31, featuring 15 group-stage matches followed by four playoff games. MI New York emerged victorious, led by captain Nicholas Pooran. The second season will be hosted at the same venues as the first: Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.\n\nFuture Prospects for MLC\n\nThe official List A status and the planned expansion underscore the growing importance of MLC in the global cricket landscape. The league’s success could play a pivotal role in embedding cricket into the American sporting culture. With strategic planning and support from major cricketing bodies and franchises, MLC has the potential to become a significant player on the international stage.\n\nAs the league prepares for its second season, the anticipation is high. The players, teams, and fans are eager to see how MLC will continue to evolve and impact the sport globally. The future looks promising for Major League Cricket, and its journey will be closely watched by cricket enthusiasts around the world.",

    "body": "In a major boost to America’s premier T20 tournament, Major League Cricket has officially been given the List A status by the International Cricket Council. Started in June last year MLC has played a vital role in promoting the game of cricket in the United States which is evident by the fact that the tournament was able to grasp the attention of the audience in a country like India which is said to have one of the biggest consumer base of cricket in the world. Despite the odd time at which the matches were being televised and streamed the T20 league was watched by the cricket-loving nation.\n\nWhat They Said?\n\nIn the words of tournament director Justin Geale “By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Success\n\nAnother reason for the tournament’ssuccess was the involvement of big players gelled with talented local players like USA’s national team captain Monak Patel, and Aaron Jones former Indian all-rounder Harmeet Singh to name some. If we talk about experienced players it includes the likes of Kieron Pollard, Sunil Narine, and Andre Russell all of whom have made a name for themselves in T20 leagues around the world.\n\nAlso Read: Star Batters Quinton De Kock And Heinrich Klaasen Stay With Seattle Orcas For MLC 2024\n\nThe Impact\n\nThe MLC has made a huge impact on the performance of the national team as well which was on show during USA’s first-ever series win against a Test-playing nation as the Monak Patel-led side beat Bangladesh by the margin of 2-1 in the three-match T20 series. This was USA’s second series win on the trott having defeated Canada 4-0 in the previous series.\n\nAlso Read: MLC Franchises Pick One Domestic Player Each Through A Wildcard Draft\n\nThe Start\n\nThe second season of the Major League Cricket will begin from July 5 2024 which is a few days after the conclusion of the 2024 T20 World Cup scheduled to be held in the West Indies and USA from June 1 to June 30 a tournament which can be a stepping stone in ICC’s bid to promote cricket in the US as it is one of the biggest market after India as far as the value of the media broadcasting rights are concerned. USA will kick off their T20 World Cup campaign with the opening match of the tournament against Canada on June 1.\n\nThe Timing\n\nOne of the reasons why the league is starting in early July is to avoid the clash with England’s new competition The Hunfred. If we talk about last year’s scenario in 2023 the league ended just two days prior to the start of the Hundred which resulted in a jam-packed schedule for the players that participated in both leagues as they had to travel from one continent to another in a short span of time.",

    "date": "Mon May  6 12:20:17 2024",
    "body": "The 2024 Cricket World Cup is a big step toward popularizing the sport in America.\n\nI believe an exciting future awaits cricket in America, and it won’t be long before we see results. The International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup begins on June 1, and the competition will span the entire month. The U.S. is not only one of 20 countries participating; the U.S. is also co-hosting the tournament with Caribbean countries.\n\nTo make things even more exciting, America’s first game–against Canada on June 1–will be played on home soil at Grand Prarie Cricket Stadium in Dallas, TX.\n\nTournament games will also be played on Long Island, in Florida, and in various locations in the West Indies, with the final match on June 29 in Barbados.\n\nLearn more about the 2024 tournament here. You can watch tournament action on Willow TV.\n\nI have no doubt that co-hosting and playing cricket here will boost domestic interest in the game. When India hosted the 2023 World Cup, the ICC reported that it recorded over a trillion viewing minutes. While India has a significant headstart on cricket interest, there’s no doubt that the World Cup will draw new U.S.-based fans to the game.\n\nBut the rise of interest in America was a long time coming. Cricket was introduced in the 18th century through British colonization, and the U.S. played its first international cricket match in 1844 against Canada at St. George’s, New York. While there’s no question that cricket’s popularity lags behind America’s big four sports–football, baseball, basketball, and ice hockey–the sport is more popular here than many people think.\n\nRecently, the U.S. kicked off Major League Cricket (MLC), and the response has been encouraging. More than 77,000 people attended the inaugural season of the MLC and bought in around $2.8 million in ticket sales revenue. MLC also reported that this league reached audiences of all levels, generating 110 million+ social media impressions and around 9 million engagements/15 million match views worldwide on YouTube.\n\nThere’s more, too. In addition to co-hosting the Cricket World Cup this year, the U.S. will also be home base to cricket’s return to the Summer Olympics after a 128-year absence. That will happen in 2028 at the Los Angeles games.\n\nSo, there are good reasons to be optimistic about cricket’s popularity here. But “likely” and “possible” popularity needs to be translated into tickets sold, customers in seats, and fans viewing the games on various platforms. Will it happen? I believe that the 2024 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics will go a long way toward popularizing the game in America, including motivating young people to play.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Cricket’s emergence as the new American dream: MLC’s Justin Geale and Royal’s Abhinav Arora on their MLC Partnership",
    "date": "Thu May  2 08:37:39 2024",
    "body": "We were worried that during Season 1, people wouldn’t come. Obviously, we have a very big fanbase existing in the U.S.A., first generation, second generation, Indians, Australians, West Indians. And I was also looking to bring in new people, but the advantage is we already have that existing fanbase.\n\nSo, to see a full house and people waving their flags and chanting, I think it blew us away. I was also happy to see new people. I thought this was a party and what a mashup this is; this is great.\n\nWhat were some challenges and opportunities encountered during this edition of MCL?\n\nJustin Geale: I think our challenge moving forward is to be proud of our association with India but also Americanize the game a bit to bring in new people, so we are going to have samosas and also, we are going to have hot dogs.\n\nIt’s about how we blend these worlds together. It’s a unique challenge we have compared to the rest of the world, but the commercial opportunity involved here is massive. And obviously, the recognition of the brands Texas Super Kings, MRD York, Los Angeles Knight Riders, you have to see the advantage because it’s a novel factor, so our challenge is also to share that with America.\n\nWe are really pleasantly surprised; we have a lot more work to do, and let’s not kid ourselves. But sponsors like Royal and Cognizant are a huge part of that because they allow us to get that credibility; they are established brands and they can fast track the league.\n\nComing to you Abhinav, tell us about your experience of the first season and first-time partnership with Major League Cricket last year?\n\nAbhinav Arora: Being an official sponsor of the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) season was a true honor for Royal. We’re excited to extend our partnership into its second year, connecting cricket fans in the United States to South Asia’s rich culture and unique cuisines.\n\n…And what are your goals for the upcoming season?\n\nAbhinav Arora: As we begin this new season, our goal is to expand on last year’s success by enhancing the cricketing experience. During the inaugural season, Royal had unveiled its new ad spot, showcasing how Royal brings authentic taste that complements the thrill of every cricket game and celebrates the many flavors of cricket and the many flavors it brings out in fans.\n\nThe one-minute ad showcased the fusion of tradition, cuisine, and cricket, emphasizing the diverse traditions and flavors that make cricket an essential component of South Asian culture.\n\nThe great comments from spectators who appreciated our Sampling done at the cricket ground, Royal® basmati rice with numerous toppings, reinforces the relationship between Royal and MLC supporters. Fans at the stadium were treated to a complimentary ‘Build Your Own Bowl’ game day snack.\n\nWe’re eager to introduce cricket fans to new innovations and our refreshed brand identity this year, continuing to elevate their experience both on and off the field.\n\nJustin, which are the brands that have partnered with Major League Cricket for this edition?\n\nJustin Geale: This year, we’ve already secured Cognizant as our title sponsor, and we’re fortunate to have Royal returning from last year. They understand the landscape, the market’s scope, having been involved before us. Utilizing their expertise is crucial for us.\n\nWe’ve secured stake from another sponsor this year, meaning we now have three sponsors with significant experience, both nationally and internationally. This adds to our credibility because they have confidence in the market and the process. It’s truly a partnership, and given the risks involved, their trust is invaluable.\n\nFor years, we’ve pondered what strategies will succeed, and it’s challenging to prove that. These sponsors showed courage by being among the first to join us, and we greatly appreciate their support and the close relationship we’ve built with them.\n\nAbhinav, tell us about the what are the opportunities this partnership presents for Royal LT Foods Americas?\n\nAbhinav Arora: At LT Foods, we are overjoyed to have reached a significant milestone in our collaboration with MLC. During the first season in the United States, they played an important role in promoting cricket culture. The combination of South Asian cuisine and this exciting sport has really lit up the atmosphere.\n\nWith Royal’s ongoing support in Season 2, we’re preparing to reach even more people and strengthen our position as North America’s go-to brand for Basmati rice and Sona Masoori rice. We’re excited to broaden our reach like never before by collaborating with Royal’s die-hard fans and cricket fanatics.\n\nWe’re delighted to showcase our new brand logo and packaging to a varied audience of sports fans in the North American market as part of our continued relationship with MLC, which will open opportunities for growth and brand recognition.\n\nSpeaking of synergies, what kind of activations or marketing initiatives can we expect to see from Royal (LT America Foods) during the tournament?\n\nAbhinav Arora: Right from the opening night, fans can immerse themselves in giveaways, contests, and the electric atmosphere of Major League Cricket matches.\n\nWhat makes this season truly special is the opportunity for fans to experience the authentic flavors of South Asia while watching spectacular matches. This blend of exciting games and Royal’s delectable cuisine provides fans with a true sense of South Asia.\n\nAt Royal, our aim is to create unforgettable moments both on and off the field, enhancing our visibility and appeal to a wide audience of food and sports enthusiasts.\n\nOur sponsorship of the MLC’s top run scorer title is a testament to our commitment to supporting cricket at its highest level. The already thrilling season is about to get even more exciting as the top hitters in the world compete for this coveted prize!\n\nWe share the values of quality, history, and community that cricket and Royal represent. We hope that by hosting this event and collaborating in general, we can naturally integrate our brand into the cricketing community.\n\nHow is Major League Cricket tackling the challenge of introducing cricket as a new sport category in a country where it isn’t prevalent?\n\nJustin Geale: I think there’s an awareness of it, but it’s like that game that goes for five days, and like, no, this (MCL) is T20, it lasts for three hours.\n\nThe most comparable thing we have is baseball, I guess. That’s a bat and ball sport. And I love baseball too, not as much as cricket, but it’s quite slow. I mean, the game goes on for three hours, and it might end 3-1. You might see one or two home runs.\n\nSo we’re playing in a field that’s 400 meters wide. There might be 40 home runs, so there might be that many Sixers. There are no foul balls. You can hit the ball 360, and every ball is an event.\n\nHow are you maximizing the partnerships with teams such as the Super Kings, LA Knight Riders, and MI? What key elements have motivated the collaboration between these franchises, particularly highlighting the market expansion, continuous engagement throughout the year, and commercial prospects in the USA?\n\nJustin Geale: It’s a learning experience for everyone involved. I believe these franchises have joined because they recognize the market’s growth. Cricket is divided into various formats like SAT 20 and IT 20, each with its own team brands. This arrangement allows for year-round engagement.\n\nThere are significant commercial opportunities, especially when considering the synergies involved. For instance, LA Knight Righters could facilitate connections between Bollywood and Hollywood, envision Shahrukh Khan’s involvement. New York’s influence in finance offers additional advantages.\n\nThis expansion provides sponsors with enhanced exposure in a large and lucrative market. While I have an appreciation for Australia and the UK, the scale of the USA’s market and its embrace of capitalism offer unparalleled potential. Overall, this venture enables brands to tap into new audiences and opportunities.\n\nWhy should brands partner with MLC? What’s in it for them?\n\nJustin Geale: I believe the time is ripe for cricket in the USA. We’ve made significant progress in the past 25 years, and the upcoming India-Pakistan game will garner global attention. With cricket entering the Olympics in 2028, there are immense opportunities for growth, including government funding and increased competitiveness. Infrastructure development is underway, and hosting international matches will boost commercial prospects.\n\nI think one of the strongest things we can do is to build awareness and recognition for brands, to get consideration, to convert these consumers. So, we’re giving exposure because we’re only going with a very small number of sponsors.\n\nWe’re placing a strong emphasis on quality. It’s not merely about displaying a logo; it’s about implementing effective activation strategies. This includes sampling and delving into the brand’s narrative and heritage. Given their extensive presence, not just in India but also in America, we’re seriously considering their longstanding experience.\n\nSponsoring cricket in the USA targets affluent demographics, influencing policy and creating new market opportunities. This shift from niche to mainstream appeal presents sponsors with a unique chance to capitalize on a growing fanbase.\n\nHow is Royal leveraging digital and social media through the cricket league to reach wider audiences?\n\nAbhinav Arora: We’ll use social media to communicate with cricket fans, publishing engaging and entertaining content that integrates our brand message with their enthusiasm for the game.\n\nWe had seen good engagement around Season 1 content like ‘A very Royal XI’ contest where fans could build their own team and win MLC tickets and a signed cricket ball by players, thrilling ‘Choose Your Bowler Bracket,’ which engaged fans by inviting them to cast their votes for their favorite cricket players and meals.\n\nWe are committed to building strong relationships with cricket fans through our recipes, behind-the-scenes glimpses at cricket events, and engaging competitions.\n\nFinally, we want to be more than just a rice brand.\n\nHow do you plan to optimize distribution channels to ensure that your content reaches key markets effectively, considering both traditional television networks and digital platforms?\n\nJustin Geale: That’s an excellent question, and it’s a challenging one indeed due to the time zone misalignment, which we’re acutely aware of. However, our franchises are deeply committed to the American market.\n\nIn terms of the American market, Willow TV holds significant importance for us. We’re actively engaging with numerous RSNs, which encompass regional sports networks hosting events such as the NFL and MLB, along with local teams.\n\nFor instance, in my location in Chicago, RSNs are pivotal for accessing sports content. Similarly, in key markets like New York, Seattle, and LA, we’re striving to establish our presence.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the importance of traditional television platforms in reaching wider audiences, we recognize that digital platforms hold immense growth potential. Drawing insights from the growth observed in India with events like the IPL and World Cups, we believe digital platforms offer significant opportunities for engaging with Indian audiences.\n\nOur focus extends beyond the core action of the game; it encompasses the surrounding content such as morning highlights packages and other supplementary materials. This comprehensive approach enables us to effectively leverage and package sponsorship opportunities.\n\nHow do these collaborations fit into the broader landscape of sports sponsorship?\n\nJustin Geale: We do aim to bring about some disruption in cricket. As a startup based in Silicon Valley ourselves, we recognize the business potential of these already massive Indian brands. The question becomes: how do we consolidate these brands and leverage their power effectively?\n\nCollaboration is key. Building a successful league is not just beneficial for the teams involved but also for our sponsors. Ultimately, the success of the league hinges on the quality of cricket. It cannot be mere gimmickry. That’s why we prioritize having top-notch pitches and recruiting the best players globally, aside from Indian players.\n\nThis year, our lineup is exceptionally strong, allowing us to showcase cricket at its finest. This commitment to excellence ensures that newcomers perceive the sport as serious.\n\nHow will the ICC T20 World Cup being hosted in the USA boost cricket in the country?\n\nJustin Geale: We must capitalize on this opportunity by catering to our existing cricket fans while also making the sport more accessible to newcomers, thus expanding its appeal to everyone. This strategic approach is essential because both the ICC and other nations recognize the potential of cricket in the USA, evident in the expedited hosting of the World Cup.\n\nHow will MLC’s efforts to promote and propagate cricket in America contribute to local infrastructure and development needs, such as enhancing facilities and providing training at school and high school levels?\n\nJustin Geale: You’ve hit the nail on the head with that observation. Schools play a pivotal role here. When you examine the sports infrastructure in American colleges and high schools, it’s truly astounding. Our long-term strategy involves integrating cricket more extensively into the sporting landscape, thereby creating opportunities for scholarships.\n\nCurrently, aspiring athletes are more inclined towards sports like golf, tennis, or baseball, as they offer pathways to scholarships and eventual professional careers. However, as we continue to expand the game, particularly through initiatives like MLC, we’re providing a viable career option in cricket.\n\nThere’s tremendous potential for women’s cricket in this regard. If we consider sports like softball, which boasts exceptional hand-eye coordination skills, there’s a missed opportunity post-college as there’s no professional league. By introducing cricket early on, we offer an alternative career path. Imagine the prospects of traveling the world and playing in franchise cricket leagues.",

I hope to play for England for many more years.”\n\nRoy is set to become the first English player to sign up to the new competition, which takes place in Texas during the final two weeks of July, with reports suggesting he is likely to turn out for the LA Knight Riders, one of six newly-formed teams, four of which are at least partially backed by IPL owners.\n\nRoy has just returned from a stint with Kolkata Knight Riders at the IPL and is set to make his first Surrey appearance of the season in Thursday’s Blast opener against Middlesex at Lord’s.\n\nIt is understood that Roy will still be available for the entirety of Surrey’s Blast campaign, including Finals Day on July 15 should the county get that far, before flying to the US and then returning in time to play for Oval Invincibles in the Hundred.\n\nRoy was demoted to an incremental deal last October, having been dropped by England’s T20 side ahead of their successful World Cup campaign, and will now forgo the remainder of his salary up until the contract was due to expire at the end of September.\n\nIncremental contracts are worth between £60,000 and £70,000 a year and Roy could earn more than twice that amount for just two weeks’ work in the US.",

    "title": "Zampa admits not getting the same buzz from franchise cricket",
    "date": "Sun May 26 09:49:19 2024",
    "body": "Adam Zampa, the T20I and ODI World Cup-winning leg spinner, has admitted that he doesn’t get the “same buzz” as international cricket while practising his trade in franchise cricket.\n\nZampa was quite active in franchise cricket leagues in 2023; however, that was to get him fully prepared and in the groove for the ODI World Cup in India. Apart from playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Rajasthan Royals (he picked eight wickets in six games), Zampa also played in the Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States of America and the Hundred in England.\n\nZampa was due to return to the Royals camp in 2024 but withdrew from the competition to spend more time with his family at home. The leggie felt that doing so would also allow him to extend his career for Australia and play as long as he could.\n\n“There’s always a lot of chat about ‘can you play franchise cricket all year round’, and it was something I had thought about – at what age do I get through to try to play a bit of franchise cricket then,” Zampa told The Age.\n\n“But after 2023 and winning the World Cup and all that, and having a young family now as well, I’ve realised I want to play cricket for as long as I can, and instead of trying to play for nine or 10 months of the year, it’s played for six or seven.”\n\nZampa also admitted that the great environment provided by head coach Andrew McDonald and skipper Pat Cummins makes him enjoy his cricket. Moreover, his contract with Cricket Australia has allowed him the freedom to opt out of lucrative T20 league stints.\n\n“I’ve really come to love playing for Australia. I always loved it, but playing under Dan Vettori, Andrew McDonald and Pat and Mitch as captains, it is just so enjoyable. I make good money playing for Australia and I would love to prioritise playing for Australia and being with my family,” Zampa said.\n\n“I don’t get enough out of franchise cricket. It’s great for certain aspects of your life, and it can be really enjoyable, but it’s not like being in the Aussie dressing room, not for me anyway. I don’t get the same buzz out of it.”\n\nZampa also accepted that if he had played the IPL, he would have “dreaded” going to the World Cup because of the short turnaround time between the two tournaments. The three-month break before the World Cup has not only rejuvenated the leggie but also allowed him time to spend with his wife and kid.\n\n“The last three months have probably been the best three months of my life. I think if I’d gone to the IPL and I was home now for a few days I think I’d be really dreading going,” Zampa said honestly.\n\n“I haven’t had a break like this since my son was born, and that’s different to what I’ve had now. It gives me a bit of an idea of what life could look like after cricket, and it does excite me. But still a long way away, I think.”\n\nAustralia begin their World Cup journey against Oman on June 6.",
    "summary": "* Adam Zampa, an Australian leg spinner, played in the MLC in the United States of America in 2023 as part of his preparation for the ODI World Cup in India.\n* Zampa also participated in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Hundred in England in 2023.\n* No further information about the MLC tournament is mentioned in the article.",

    "title": "The Major League Cricket for 2024 Season has a new powerful partner",
    "date": "Sun May 26 17:25:15 2024",
    "body": "On the 2nd of April, 2024, Cognizant Major League Cricket announced that they would be partnering with Stake.com for the MLC 2024 season.\n\nThe social casino, online gaming and sports betting brand is now the official sponsor for the American T20 League. They’ve signed a multi-year deal to support the MLC’s second season this summer.\n\nFor cricket fans in the United States and around the globe, this new strategic partnership is great news. With a strong financial backer supporting the league so early on in it’s history, there’s no doubt that the viewing experience for both casual fans and dedicated bettors will be greatly boosted.\n\nA summer of cricket with Stake.com\n\nWhen asked for comment on the partnership, Stake’s Chief Marketing Officer stated, “We thoroughly enjoyed MLC’s inaugural season in 2023 and jumped at the chance to become an Official Partner for 2024 and beyond. With the T20 World Cup taking place on US soil later in the year, we see this as a breakout year for cricket in the US and can’t wait to be a part of it.”\n\nThe partnership will allow Stake to be among the first betting platforms in line to connect with a passionate and rapidly growing American fanbase.\n\nAs for the fans, they can expect to see splashes of the brand’s logo throughout coverage for the season, which will officially begin on the 4th of July, just 4 days after the 2024 T20 World Cup wraps up. Along with prominent branding, fans may also look forward to participating in a number sponsored contests throughout the season.\n\nStake.com is also proud to be holding a prestigious honor this year at the league’s final. They are sponsoring the MVP of the Tournament award for the season’s top performing player. According to the official press release, this will add some needed recognition and weight to this already coveted award.\n\nLast year’s MVP winner was Nicholas Pooran due to his spectacular display of athleticism in last year’s explosive championship final. After South African cricketer Aiden Markram’s incredible catch earlier this year, it’s clear that 2024 is gearing up to be an exceptional year for cricket excellence, even more so now that Stake.com has entered the fold.\n\nWhat does this mean for bettors?\n\nThe partnership will likely be a cause for celebration among betting fans. The brand already has a great track record when it comes to growing and elevating sporting fan communities. MLC’s co-founder backs up this claim. In a statement, Srinivasan mentioned that he believes the partnership will bring the growth American cricket needs to flourish for many years to come.\n\nThe brains behind the MLC believe that, with Stake.com as a partner, the continued growth of the league is in good hands. In a statement, MLC’s co-founder Vijay Srinivasan said, “We’re excited to be partnering with a renowned company that supports many global sports properties.”\n\nIf fans of the MLC aren’t already familiar with Stake’s offering, now would be a great time to look into what the platform has in store for cricket and other sporting events this year. Not only is the platform highly regarded by seasoned bettors, newcomers can use the following promo code for Stake.com to effectively triple an initial deposit and get started placing wagers with the casino operator.\n\nWith the MLC tournament still a few weeks away, it will quickly become clear what other benefit Stake’s bettor’s can expect to see. Based on previous sponsorships, there’s a good chance bettors might see expanded betting options for MLC matches. There also might be other exclusive promotions on offer closer to the event.\n\nCasual fans might want to look into Stake’s platform too, even if betting isn’t their style. The site will no doubt offer some form of educational resources for people to learn more about the league and it’s players along with live statistic feeds for cricket fans who love to get stuck into extra facts and figures.\n\nThis isn’t Stake’s first rodeo\n\nWith the MLC partnership secured, Stake.com is expanding its already surprisingly extensive sports sponsorship portfolio. Most notably, the brand has previously become a title sponsor for a Formula One team and secured sponsorship deals with the UFC and Everton FC.\n\nThe brand has enjoyed a meteoric rise due, in part, by partnering with major sporting events. In just three short years, the previously unknown betting platform has processed an absolutely mind-blowing 45 billion sports gaming bets. The reasons behind this success has everything to do with Stake’s commitment to favorable odds, instant withdrawals and immensely thrilling promotions.\n\nThere’s little to no doubt that the timing of this MLC partnership is no accident. Stake.com appears to recognize the immense potential of American cricket, especially with the T20 World Cup also set to take place in the United States later this year. If cricket can become a major sport in the country with the same level of prestige as Major League Basketball or the NFL, this would open up a lucrative new betting market.\n\nWhen the season officially gets underway this July, there’s a good chance that the already exciting sport that is T20 Cricket will be even more action packed than ever. With Stake’s expertise guiding community building and facilitating safe and transparent betting, fans of all shapes and sizes will be in for a real cricket-themed treat.",

    "title": "San Francisco Unicorns Embracing Silicon Valley Identity As Major League Cricket Takes Off",
    "date": "Thu May 23 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Co-owned by Silicon Valley venture capitalists, San Francisco Unicorns have decided to embrace a specific identity as the franchise builds a brand in the fledgling Major League Cricket.\n\n\"The way we assembled the franchise...we want to be the Silicon Valley team. Silicon Valley is where start-ups are key,\" Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman told me in a phone interview. \"We want to identify young players who become icons. Our focus has been on finding superstars for the future.\n\n\"We wanted to use data and AI to inform and evaluate the sport.\"\n\nAnd which budding star did the cutting edge technology spit out? Jake Fraser-McGurk, the 22-year-old batting dynamo whose devastating power-hitting has lit up the ongoing Indian Premier League to such a degree that Australia's hierarchy were compelled to add him to their T20 World Cup squad as a reserve.\n\nThe Unicorns, who finished second from the bottom last year, quickly pounced and signed Fraser-McGurk for the upcoming season starting on July 5 in a somewhat reconnection with his former state Victoria, who have a high-performance partnership with the Unicorns.\n\n\"We've seen in the IPL that T20 is moving towards power striking and we're seeing huge totals scored, so we've gone for young players who can do that,\" Rajaraman said.\n\n\"We are trying something different with that start-up mindset. We've built a young list. We're hoping to start building tight affiliations with players, so fans can start seeing those connections.\"\n\nRajaraman and co-owner Venky Harinarayan understand the challenges that lie ahead for the Unicorns, with the novelty factor wearing off from the successful debut of MLC as cricket attempts to genuinely infiltrate the world's biggest sports market.\n\nAfter building the blocks in 2019, with investment topping $100 million, the well-heeled MLC's scheduled launch in 2021 then 2022 was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But its debut last season was nonetheless rushed leaving franchises scrambling to fill rosters.\n\n\"The decision to play the season was made just two months before the season. We didn't really have time to assemble a team,\" Harinarayan said. \"We just tried to put everything together and it was sort of a trial. It was a case of getting some players and see if this thing works.\n\n\"Even for a lot of the players it wasn't clear that this league was here to stay. The first season exceeded our expectations, but we start the second season with a little bit of nervousness because we have to sustain the momentum and then grow it.\"\n\nThe six-team MLC will expand by six games this season with teams to play seven matches in the group stages ahead of the four playoff games concluding with the final on July 28. As I reported recently, salary caps will not increase, but player wages will remain in the top echelons of T20 professional leagues.\n\nThere is an eventual goal that a home-and-away season - where teams play each other twice - will underpin MLC, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds with significant infrastructure required.\n\nLike last year the entire tournament will once again be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina. For the Unicorns, a stadium in San Jose in the works but still likely several years away.\n\n\"We are hampered until we actually play games at home. It's going to be a challenge for us to actually build real connectivity in the community,\" Harinarayan said. \"We want to first nail the South Asian community. The number two country in terms of new citizens in the U.S. was India after Mexico.\n\n\"At the same time we are very conscious that we want to make this experience, especially in the stadiums, really friendly to folks who are not South Asian.\n\n\"We saw last season that a fair number of locals, who weren't cricket fans, just showed up because it was on and they were surprised how much they enjoyed it.\"\n\nMLC starts less than a week after the T20 World Cup, which is partly hosted by the U.S. with group games in New York, Dallas and Lauderhill, Florida.\n\nWhile the build-up of the T20 World Cup has been completely overshadowed by the pointy end of the money-spinning IPL, there has been considerable attention on cricket's investment into the U.S.\n\nThe newly constructed ground in Long Island - costing around $30 million, as I reported recently - has grabbed much of the headlines and so too the exorbitant prices for resale tickets for the tournament's marquee game between rivals India and Pakistan in New York.\n\n\"Folks have commented how crazy the (India-Pakistan) prices are... they are even mind blowing for a Super Bowl,\" Rajaraman said. \"There's a lot of energy and excitement about that game and particularly India playing in the U.S.\n\n\"It's obviously phenomenal for cricket in America. Hopefully MLC gets a tailwind from it.\"\n\nThe Unicorns are the latest partnership between Rajaraman and Harinarayan. They were founding partners of early ecommerce company Junglee, which was acquired by Amazon Amazon in 1998 for $250 million. They also later founded Kosmix, which was acquired by Walmart Walmart , and were early investors in Facebook.\n\nThey've had an early win in their foray into sports with the Unicorns' distinctive name proving catchy among its fanbase after initial skepticism. \"You can either pick a safe name and just create an empty vessel or basically pick something which maybe not everybody likes,\" Harinarayan said.\n\n\"It got people riled up, but people really love it. There were fans wearing caps and attire and making their own interpretation of the name. The feedback has been extraordinarily positive.\"\n\nOwning a cricket team, the sport they are so passionate about, still feels slightly surreal for the India-born entrepreneurs.\n\n\"There's a bit of drudgery to be honest, but we really enjoy the cricket aspects,\" Rajaraman said. \"We want to get better as a franchise while also playing our part in making the league and U.S. cricket stronger.\n\n\"Just like from the start-up mindset, it sometimes takes a couple of iterations to get things right.\"",

The US had a taste of franchise cricket in 2023, with the resoundingly successful inaugural season of Major League Cricket, but international cricket history in North America goes back a long, long time. So far back, in fact, that the first ever international cricket match on record was played here, at the St George's Cricket Club ground in New York, between United States and Canada in 1844 (and Canada won).\n\nIn 1859, the US also hosted the first international cricket tour when an England XI travelled to the country - three years before the first England tour of Australia - to play five matches and three exhibition games against local cricketers, one of whom was later baseball pioneer Harry Wright.\n\nAn illustration of a match in progress in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851, between the New England and St George's cricket clubs © Corbis via Getty Images\n\nCricket's popularity dwindled after the American Civil War, as baseball's began to grow, but clubs across US and Canada continued to play each other intermittently well into the 20th century.\n\nMembers of the Winnipeg Junior Cricket Club play a game in Lincoln Park in Chicago in 1935 © Getty Images\n\nPhiladelphia and Pennsylvania remained thriving hubs of cricket in America where matches still drew sizeable crowds.\n\nImpeccably turned out spectators at a game at Merion Cricket Club in Haverford, Pennsylvania in 1938 © Getty Images\n\nBy the mid- to late 20th century, cricket was reduced to being largely a novelty sport, though expats would often hold exhibition games, as Eddie Phillips, a cricketer from Brighton in England did on his holiday in St Louis.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe the pitches in New Orleans.

    "title": "Canada’s Debut At T20 World Cup Drives Cricket Growth In North America",
    "date": "Tue May 21 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "The Cricket T20 World Cup is approaching fast. Anticipation for the first match between the co-hosts, the United States and their North American neighbors Canada on June 1 is gaining momentum. The game will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium, the former home of the Texas AirHogs and venue of the first Major League Cricket season last year.\n\nWhile much focus is on whether the home nation can compete with the giants of their group, India and Pakistan, the Canadians can slip happily below the radar. In a warm-up five match series with their nearest rivals, geographically at least, they lost 4-0 with one match washed out. Expectation isn't huge. Historically, the Maple Leafers can at least claim the bragging rights over the U.S. with a famous win in the first recorded international cricket match in 1844.\n\nThere’s a huge heritage in Canadian cricket and the continuation of the annual Auty Cup is a nod to the connection between the two nations on the green fields before baseball pitched up. Once upon a time on the prairie, cricket was declared Canada’s national sport by its first-ever PM John A Macdonald. The Toronto Cricket Club was established in 1827 although the inception of the game was strongly influenced by the missions of the Royal Navy and the British Army. George A. Barber, an English schoolmaster, was prominent in setting up the Toronto Club and is known as the father of Canadian cricket.\n\nThe most important development in recent times for the international team has been regaining their ODI status after almost a decade out of he mainstream loop. “Regaining (the ODI) status after nine long years is an outstanding achievement and a game-changing moment for Cricket Canada. It puts us on the same map as the leading Associate cricketing nations in the world,” said a jubilant former Cricket Canada President Rashpal Bajwa to the Emerging Cricket site this time last year.\n\nIt has been a long journey back for a country that had appeared in the 1979, 2003, 2007 and 2011 50-over World Cups before the ICC introduced the new World Cricket League divisional structure. This meant Associate members needed to finish in the top six of the World Cricket League Division 2 tournament. At their lowest ebb, Canada were languishing in League Division Three by 2017.\n\nThis has resulted in difficulties retaining a solid playing pool. In a 2015 interview with ESPNcricinfo, former captain Rizwan Cheema summed up the mood: “Once you slip down the pecking order [in Associate cricket] it's hard to climb out. It's hard to even have players for the team. If there's no career as a cricketer, how do you keep your players interested?\"\n\nNow the surge, the revival, is making the Maple Leaf fly in the wind again. Cricket is the fastest-growing sport in the country, supercharged with the return of the GT20, a franchise that first appeared with considerable success in 2018 when it attracted stars like Steve Smith, Chris Gayle, David Warner and Andre Russell. Before the pandemic, it was the most watched event in North America outside of the Super Bowl.\n\nIn the 2023 GT20 season, six teams were allocated $579,000 to spend on a 16-man roster with the proviso that at least six Canadians would be included and that three must be in the starting XI. That averaged at $36,000 per player and again attracted a healthy cohort of international stars who could energize and educate homegrown talent. Tim Southee, Mohammad Rizwan, Rassie van der Dussen, and World No. 1 allrounder Shakib Al Hasan were among the luminaries. Gayle, now very much in his dotage at 44, also returned for the fun as did Pakistan cricket legend Shahid Afridi.\n\nThe action took place in Ontario's Brampton sports complex which is aiming to morph into a major cricket international facility. The City has allocated $7 million for further growth although funding might be three or four times more than an estimated $49 million to expand the current CAA Centre from a 5,000-seater to a fully-fledged and equipped venue.\n\nThe tournament was broadcast to 110 countries around the world with an estimated television audience of about 150 million people globally, the vast majority of which was outside North America. The trick now is to grow the grassroots game and get away from the part-time \"weekend warriors\" contracts of the past. There's still a dearth of dedicated cricket grounds as many matches are played in multi-sport venues. Canada's elevation to League 2 will ensure the squad are paid salaries between $55,000 to $65,000 and will train full-time.\n\nCanada’s first venture into the T20 World Cup is led by 37-year-old skipper Saad Bin Zafar, a veteran of 38 T20Is. Like the U.S. team, most of the playing members are thirtysomething and of Indian or Pakistan origin although opening bat Aaron Johnson brings some Caribbean flair to the team. His 74 at Prairie View in the second T20 against the States in April came at a strike rate of 184 with six sixes. Canada will need something special from him in the real thing.",

At least two of the three American venues will host matches, with a site for the India v Bangladesh warm-up match on June 1 yet to be confirmed though the expectation is that it will be played at the newly unveiled Nassau County International Stadium.\n\nUSA’s pair of warm-up fixtures have been announced for May 28 and 30 to both be played at Grand Prairie Stadium, 12 miles west of Dallas, Texas. In a peculiar decision, USA will play Bangladesh in an official warm-up match on May 28 despite the fact that USA is already scheduled to play three official T20Is against Bangladesh at Prairie View Cricket Complex from May 21-25. USA’s second official warm-up match will be played against Nepal on May 30.\n\nNepal will also have an earlier warm-up match to be played against Canada on May 27 in Grand Prairie, which will be the first international matches of any kind – warm-up or full T20Is – to be played at Grand Prairie Stadium. The USA v Nepal match on May 30 will be part of a doubleheader in which the second match of the day will feature Netherlands against Canada to complete the set of four warm-up matches to be played at the facility which reopened in 2023 – and hosted the first season of the Major League Cricket T20 franchise tournament – following an estimated $20 million renovation from its original layout as a minor league baseball stadium.\n\nBroward County Stadium in Lauderhill, Florida will be hosting three warm-up matches, beginning on May 28 when Netherlands plays Sri Lanka. It will be the first of two warm-up matches for Sri Lanka at the facility. They will also take on Ireland on May 31 before both teams travel to New York ahead of their first matches of the tournament. Sri Lanka starts off their Group D slate against South Africa on June 3 at Nassau County International Stadium while Ireland opens on June 5 at the same venue against India.\n\nThe remaining warm-up fixture scheduled for Broward County Stadium is an intrasquad match for South Africa on May 29. It is the only intrasquad practice match officially scheduled by the ICC for any team in the tournament.\n\nThe final warm-up fixture between India and Bangladesh is yet to be given a designated venue by the ICC. The expectation is that it will be held in New York on June 1 at Nassau County International Stadium so that the ICC can have at least one match played on the new drop-in wickets that have been installed at the newly opened venue in Long Island, New York before the official first T20I is played at the venue on June 3. But if the New York venue – which took less than four months to complete at an estimated $30 million cost – is unavailable for any reason, the match may be held at Broward County Stadium or canceled outright because Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas will be unavailable that day since it is due to host the opening match of the tournament that night between USA and Canada.\n\nA total of eight other warm-up matches are slated to be held in Trinidad & Tobago – the only Caribbean venue due to host any official warm-up matches – at both Brian Lara Academy and Queen’s Park Oval. The only two Full Member to have two warm-ups scheduled in Trinidad are Australia and Afghanistan. Australia will play Namibia on May 28 and West Indies on May 30. Afghanistan are set to face Oman on May 29 and Scotland on May 31.\n\nAssociate sides Papua New Guinea, Oman, Uganda, Scotland and Namibia all have two warm-up matches scheduled. The only tournament participants not to have any warm-ups scheduled against other teams are England, South Africa, Pakistan, New Zealand and Zimbabwe.",

Several big names are in line to represent the USA in international cricket. USA Cricket received a major boost when Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan's Kolkata Knight Riders announced that it would invest in Major League cricket (MLC), a tournament emulating the IPL, as well as own a franchise in it.\n\nThe USA are targeting players who haven't been selected in international cricket for some time and are ready to shift there to rekindle their careers in cricket.\n\nThe Business Standard (TBS) looks at five cricketers who have recently opted to play cricket for the USA.\n\nCorey Anderson\n\nCorey Anderson, an explosive left-handed batter and a useful medium-pace bowler, is a great addition to the USA's cricket set-up. The former Black Caps all-rounder once held the record of the fastest century in ODIs. He has made 93 appearances for New Zealand across formats and won them several games. Anderson was part of the 2015 World Cup squad that came second in the tournament.\n\nThe all-rounder's international career has been plagued by injuries. The 30-year-old called time on his international career last year and signed a three-year deal with the USA's Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nSami Aslam\n\nSami Aslam captained Pakistan to the final of the 2014 Under-19 World Cup in the UAE. The talented left-handed batter made his international debut in 2015. Aslam played 13 Tests and four ODIs for Pakistan and since then he has fallen out of favor. In November 2020, the 25-year old cut ties with Pakistan Cricket with the aim of representing the USA.\n\nAslam said that he wasn't happy with the way he was treated and added that he was more than happy to be in America after being depressed in Pakistan for two years. He will be eligible to play for the USA in 2023. Recently he was selected in the players' draft ahead of Minor League Cricket (MLC).\n\nDane Piedt\n\nDane Piedt, former Protea off-spinner who played nine Tests, ended his association with Cricket South Africa last year and shifted to South Africa to play in the Minor League Cricket (MLC).\n\n\"It was an opportunity I just couldn't pass up, financially and for lifestyle reasons, but it was still a tough decision to make,\" he said.\n\nPiedt made his Test debut in 2014 and delivered a career-best performance to thump Zimbabwe. His last appearance in international cricket was in 2019 against India. Piedt is a prolific performer in South Africa's domestic set-up, having picked up more than 400 first-class wickets.\n\nShehan Jayasuriya\n\nShehan Jayasuriya is another exciting addition to USA Cricket as he retired from the Sri Lanka cricket team earlier this year and decided to relocate to the USA with his family. Jayasuriya is a handy all-around cricketer, batting left-handed and bowling right-arm off-spin. He played 30 international matches for Sri Lanka but couldn't really replicate the success he had in domestic cricket.\n\nJayasuriya last played an international match for Sri Lanka in March 2019. In June 2021, he was selected in the players' draft ahead of Minor League Cricket (MLC).\n\nUnmukt Chand\n\nUnmukt Chand was earmarked to become a superstar of Indian cricket after he led India to glory in the 2012 ICC Under-19 World Cup. He made a sensational hundred against Australia in the final of that tournament and became a household name in India. He played for India A regularly from 2013 to 2015. Chand represented three IPL franchises but failed to live up to his immense potential.\n\nThe 28-year-old cricketer has relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and signed a multi-year agreement with Major League Cricket in the USA. The 28-year old will be eligible to play for the USA after serving the residency period.",

    "date": "Thu May 23 06:49:49 2024",
    "body": "NEW YORK: The US cricket team which will co-host the Twenty20 World Cup may be a fitting cross-section of its country as a roster of migrants, a melting pot of nationalities and cultures.\n\nThe 15-man squad includes players born in India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa. Home-grown players include vice-captain Aaron Jones, who was born in Queens, and allrounder Steven Taylor, of Hialeah, Florida.\n\nThe team provides a snapshot of US cricket at this formative stage, as Major League Cricket jostles for its place in a crowded sporting market. The squad includes foreign players drawn to America by the MLC and local players given the chance to play cricket at a professional level in the United States\n\nThe home team’s most recognized member is the former New Zealand allrounder Corey Anderson. The 33-year-old Anderson played 13 Tests, 49 one-day internationals and 31 T20 internationals for New Zealand between 2013 and 2018 in a career limited by injuries.\n\nHe earned a place in cricket history for his 36-ball century in a one-day international between New Zealand and the West Indies on New Year’s Day, 2014. Anderson also has played in T20 leagues in Australia, India, the Caribbean and UAE before finding an MLC home at the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nAnderson made his first half-century for the US in their T20 win over Canada last month.\n\nMumbai-born Harmeet Singh, who played for India at two Under-19 World Cups, was the star for the 19th-ranked US team earlier this week in an upset win over Bangladesh. It the only the second win over a full ICC member for the US\n\nHe scored 33 from the 13 deliveries he faced and shared an unbeaten, match-winning 62-run partnership with Anderson, who was unbeaten on 34.\n\n“It means a lot to us to put on a show against Bangladesh. We are no walkovers,” Harmeet told ESPNcricinfo. “I think our potential is immense.”\n\nThe US meet Canada in the tournament opener on June 1 and then there’ll be a step up for both teams in Group A, which also includes India and Pakistan, fierce cricket rivals with enormous support, and Ireland.\n\nAmong the other foreign-born players on the US squad coached by ex-Australia batter Stuart Law is right-arm fast bowler Ali Khan, who moved with his parents from Pakistan to the US when he was 18.\n\nHe first played for the US team in 2016 and has also has played in the Indian Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and Pakistan Premier League, in Global T20 Canada and the Afghanistan Premier League.\n\nCaptain Monank Patel, a wicketkeeper-batsman, was born in India and settled in New Jersey after moving permanently to the US in 2016. He played at a junior level for Gujarat in India and played the first of his 47 one-day internationals and 23 T20 internationals for the US in 2019.\n\nAndries Gous, another wicketkeeper-batsmen, was born in Welkom, South Africa, played for South Africa at under-19 level and played 60 first-class matches before relocating to the US in 2021. He and Patel were the highest scorers for the US in the recent five-match series against Canada.\n\nAllrounder Milind Kumar is another India-born player who accumulated nine centuries in 60 first-class appearances for Delhi before making his home in the US\n\nThe Canada team scheduled to meet the US in the opening match is also a team drawn from many places and shaped by the evolution of a professional league at home.\n\nCanada will be led by the veteran left-armer spinner Saad bin Zafar, who was born in Pakistan. He moved to Canada to study and was first named in the Canadian T20 team in 2008. Now 37, he has played 38 T20 internationals and once took two wickets without conceding a run in four overs in a T20 against Panama.\n\nJamaica-born batter Aaron Johnson, Pakistan-born left-arm fast bowler Kaleem Sana and Guyana-born right-arm quick Dillon Heyliger reflect the international makeup of the team which is coached by former Sri Lanka international Pubudu Dassanayake.\n\nFred Trueman of Yorkshire and England was long regarded as his nation’s greatest fast bowler. In his prime, he bowled a thousand overs for Yorkshire during a summer.\n\nThis was an era when the only cricket matches on view, apart from Tests, were three-day county championships between 17 counties. In 1964, Trueman was the first bowler to claim 300 wickets in Test matches. When asked if he thought his achievement would be beaten, his response — typical of the man — was: “Aye, but whoever does it will be very tired.”\n\nSince then, 36 bowlers have beaten Trueman’s record. Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan claimed 800, followed by Australia’s Shane Warne with 708, and then there is England’s James Anderson, who has 700 and is due to play his last Test this year.\n\nAnderson’s longevity and fitness is truly remarkable. He has sent down almost 40,000 deliveries in Test matches alone, the fourth highest among those taking more than three hundred wickets. He is not admitting to any tiredness and is regarded by some as having claim to be England’s finest quick bowler, rather than Trueman. Both their achievements, in different eras, are extraordinary. Trueman’s feat was accompanied by a bowling average of 21.57, only bettered by Malcom Marshall (20.94) and Curtly Ambrose (20.99). Anderson’s is 26.52.\n\nIt is against the background of these achievements that current cries for help by professional cricketers to reduce their workload should be gauged. Another of Yorkshire’s finest players is Joe Root who, in 140 Tests for England so far, has scored 11,626 runs. This puts him 10th on the all-time list of top Test run scorers. His workload has been intense for years, even more so when he captained England in 64 Tests, yet he rarely complains. Last week, however, he called for a major rethink of English cricket’s crowded schedule.\n\nThis was accompanied by the Professional Cricketers Association calling for change “before something disastrous happens.”\n\nBased on a survey of professional male cricketers, the PCA revealed that key concerns are physical heath (81 percent), travel conditions (75 percent) and mental health (62 percent). Long-distance driving late at night, whether moving between matches or traveling home, is a particular worry. It is argued that player welfare and performance are compromised by the lack of time to recover, prepare and practice.\n\nProfessional cricket in England and Wales has a particular issue in that there are four men’s competitions shoe-horned into a window between mid-April and the end of September, with August given over entirely to The Hundred. Last year, proposals to reduce the amount of four-day county cricket and T20 cricket were rejected by the counties. Effectively, the 50 over competition has been downgraded because so few of the top players appear in it. According to Root, the objective should be to get “the standard of first-class and county cricket as close as you can to the international game.”\n\nProfessional cricketers in England and Wales have raised the issue of congested schedules and travelling pressure before. The explosion of T20 cricket in the last 20 years has increased this congestion and turned it into a more international concern. In India and Australia, for example, the distances between venues are much greater, with flying and its attendant risks additional factors.\n\nIn November 2023, during the announcement of India’s ODI squad for a series against Australia, India’s captain, Rohit Sharma, blamed excessive travel for injured players across the teams. It is in the interests of all cricket boards to narrow the gap between the standard of the breeding ground of first-class cricket and international cricket. Each one has different ways of doing so, a reflection of relative resources, geography and historic structures.\n\nIn India, reform is proposed for 2024-25. It seems likely that the Ranji Trophy, the country’s state-based long format game and the equivalent of the English county championship, will be split into two halves. White ball tournaments would be held in between. The main drivers behind this are to address variable winter weather conditions in the north and to allow longer gaps between matches to facilitate travel and recovery. This is similar reasoning to that aired by Joe Root and the PCA.\n\nMore forgiving schedules may release pressure on mental health, an often-overlooked facet of professional sport. There have been a number of high-profile cases in recent years in cricket. Azeem Rafiq’s experience of racism at Yorkshire was one. Another was Jonathan Trott, who played 52 Tests for England between 2009 and 2015. He left England’s tour of Australia in November 2013, unable to cope with the demands at that level. A man with very high levels of concentration lost them and referred to the impact of social media, saying: “People don't look you in the face and have a conversation and ask you how you are.”\n\nRohit Sharma, in the aftermath of India’s defeat in the 2023 ODI World Cup Final, was mentally shattered. He eschewed social media and opted out of ODI and T20I assignments against South Africa. Men’s cricket is a tough environment that appears not to appreciate that mental health issues are real. The growth of women’s cricket has brought about a change in approaches to mental health within the game. A webinar which I joined this week promoted by the Cricket Research Network discussed the different physiological challenges which women face in advancing in the game.\n\nQuite what Fred Trueman would have made of this is an open question. He was an un-constituted menacing quick bowler who bullied opponents. It is not unreasonable to assume he would have been aghast at the notion of women playing professional cricket.\n\nAfter his playing days were over, he became a pundit and commentator. His catch line was: “I don’t know what is going on.” He would be even more at a loss in today’s world of social media and Bollywood-style cricket.\n\nMUMBAI: Nicholas Pooran starred in Lucknow Super Giants’ 18-run victory over pre-tournament favorites Mumbai Indians in the last game of a disappointing Indian Premier League season for both teams Friday.\n\nThe maverick West Indies’ wicketkeeper-batsman hit eight sixes in his 29-ball 75 to take Lucknow to 214-6 after Mumbai skipper Hardik Pandya won the toss and chose to field first.\n\nMumbai crashed to 196-6 despite an impressive start by openers Rohit Sharma and Dewald Brevis in their rain-interrupted chase.\n\nPandya said that it was “quite difficult” for five-time champions Mumbai, who finished the 10-team league in last spot.\n\n“This season we didn’t play good quality cricket and it cost us the whole season,” Pandya said.\n\nLucknow too failed to qualify for the playoffs and ended the tournament in sixth spot.\n\nCaptain KL Rahul said that it was “very disappointing.”\n\nHe blamed mid-season injuries to key players and said that they “didn’t play well enough collectively and couldn’t come together” as a team.\n\nEarlier, Nuwan Thushara got Mumbai off to a great start and removed opener Devdutt Padikkal for a first ball duck.\n\nPadikkal’s partner Rahul stitched together a 48-run partnership with Australia’s Marcus Stoinis, who fell to Piyush Chawla’s leg-spin for a 22-ball 28 in the sixth over.\n\nChawla also removed Deepak Hooda (11) to reduce Lucknow to 69-3 by the 10th over.\n\nThushara finally removed Pooran in the 17th over to end his match-defining, 109-run partnership with Rahul.\n\nHe also removed rookie Arshad Khan (0) in the same over and finished with 3-28 in his four-over spell.\n\nChawla removed Rahul, who took 41 balls for his 55 runs, in the 18th over and finished with 3-29.\n\nKey unbeaten cameos by Ayush Badoni (22) and Krunal Pandya (12) took Lucknow to 214-6.\n\nMumbai’s openers took their team to 88 before Brevis fell for 23 in the ninth over.\n\nIndia skipper Sharma top-scored with a 38-ball 68 with 10 fours and three sixes before he fell in the 11th over.\n\nIn between, Mumbai also lost their best T20 batsman, Suryakumar Yadav, for 0 and were reduced to 97-3 while out-of-form skipper Pandya fell for 16.\n\nIndian rookie Naman Dhir hit five sixes and four fours in his unbeaten 28-ball 62.\n\nLeg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi, who removed Sharma, and Afghanistan’s Naveen-ul-Haq, who removed Brevis, took four key Mumbai wickets between them.\n\nOn May 11, the second of a four-day county championship match unfolded in front of my eyes at the Utilita Bowl, Southampton. This is the home of Hampshire County Cricket Club. On a rare sunny day, there seemed to be around 600 other people watching, a majority in the members’ area.\n\nHampshire CCC is unusual in that it is one of three out of the 18 county cricket clubs in England and Wales that are not subject to member votes. It is owned by Hampshire Sport & Leisure Holdings, a private limited company which oversees sporting and leisure activities on the site. Its former chair, who was instrumental in saving the county from insolvency in 2001, owns 60 percent of the shares.\n\nBy coincidence, Hampshire’s opponents were Durham County Cricket Club, another county not subject to member votes. It is constituted as a Community Interest Company, a form of social enterprise. Northamptonshire County Cricket Club is the third one not to be subject to member votes, being constituted as a private company limited by guarantee.\n\nThe scene at Southampton would have been replicated at the other five county championship matches taking place on May 11. At the same time in Kolkata, the Knight Riders and the Mumbai Indians were preparing to play the 60th match of the 2024 Indian Premier League franchise competition. Average spectator attendance in the IPL is estimated to be 30,000. These two different models of promoting cricket may be about to coalesce, if proposed changes to the landscape in England and Wales come to fruition.\n\nThe changes center on The Hundred, a format of cricket introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board in 2021. The two teams each play a single innings of 100 deliveries, divided into 20 overs of five deliveries, with two overs bowled from each end alternately. Each match is scheduled to last for two-and-a-half hours. Eight men’s teams and eight women’s teams comprise separate competitions with all matches played back-to-back on the same day at the same venue. The whole of August is allocated to The Hundred to the exclusion of other formats.\n\nEver since its inception, the tournament has been divisive on several levels. First, it has segregated the 18 counties into those who host The Hundred and those who do not. The eight participating counties are Glamorgan, Hampshire, Lancashire, Middlesex, Nottinghamshire, Surrey, Warwickshire and Yorkshire. However, the teams do not carry the county names, since the concept was to create city-based teams using existing county facilities. Agreement to progress with the tournament depended upon the support of excluded counties. This was achieved by the ECB’s offer to pay each county £1.3 million ($1.6 million) for their backing.\n\nAt a second level, there are differing opinions about the opportunity cost of this funding. The ECB receives around 75 percent of its income from the sale of broadcasting rights, a substantial part of which relates to Test-match cricket. Critics argue that using this money to support and develop a format which represents an existential threat to Test cricket is willful. They argue that the funds should be deployed in producing players for the longer rather than shorter formats.\n\nOn a third level, it is argued that the focus on eight counties, instead of 18, will hasten the demise of some of the latter, several of whom are in parlous financial circumstances. It is understood that, in the last two years, five counties have received financial help from the ECB. Overall debt levels in county cricket may be in the order of £200 million, some of this being incurred in stadium development designed to host international matches. In addition, operational costs have increased sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is in this context that the ECB’s current proposal to sell off 49 percent of equity in The Hundred has great attraction. The balance of 51 percent would be owned by the host county, which can decide to retain it all or sell part or all of it. The proceeds of the 49 percent are to be distributed to counties according to an undisclosed formula. The ECB requested that counties agreed to a “direction of travel” by May 10.\n\nA divergence of opinion has emerged amongst the counties about the proposed model for distributing the spoils, split broadly between those who host The Hundred and those who do not. Needless to say, both sides appear to want more. In terms of numbers, some reports assert that the ECB’s sale of 49 percent equity might raise some $507 million (£400 million) for distribution, enough to salve the cash problems of a few counties. It is understandable that the non-hosting counties fear that they could get sold down the river.\n\nThere is already a fear that they are becoming marginalized by not being a host of The Hundred format. If the money raised by the ECB falls well short of the $507 million, then their financial problems may not be solved and their marginalization exacerbated. There are also legitimate concerns over governance and scheduling issues once private owners become involved. At this stage, the nature of private investors is unknown. It would be no surprise if Indian franchise owners show interest. However, it is reasonable to assume that they would not be content with either a minority stake or minority voice.\n\nCricket in England and Wales is at a watershed moment, caught in a maze of alternative possibilities, each one of which has unknown consequences. The ECB, under previous management, was the architect of this moment, through its introduction of The Hundred, which is contracted to run until 2028. In a twist of fate, it is now regarded as a medium for escape from impecunity. The alternative to equity sale is to do nothing and watch the system crumble. Equity sale will be tantamount to privatizing a part of that system. It was difficult to escape the feeling at Southampton that I was watching one part of that system which is heading for trauma.\n\nGUWAHATI, India: Skipper Sam Curran starred with bat and ball as Punjab Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by five wickets for a consolation win in the Indian Premier League on Wednesday.\n\nChasing a tricky 145 on a sluggish pitch, Punjab depended on Curran’s unbeaten 63 to achieve their target with seven balls to spare in Rajasthan’s adopted home ground in Guwahati.\n\nLeft-handed Curran put on a key 63-run stand with Jitesh Sharma, who made 22, and despite losing his partner in the 16th over steered the team home to lift them from the bottom of the 10-team table.\n\nImpact substitute Ashutosh Sharma smashed 17 and the winning run to hand Rajasthan their fourth successive defeat in this edition of the T20 tournament.\n\n“To be very honest, we have to sit back and accept that we are going through some failures,” Rajasthan skipper Sanju Samson said.\n\n“You have to find out what’s not working well as a team. When you are getting to the business end, we need someone to raise their finger up and say I am going to win the game for the team. We have the players who can do that.”\n\nThe loss for Rajasthan hurt their chances of a top-two finish in the league stage a day after they confirmed their play-off spot.\n\nRajasthan, who stay in second place with one game in hand, and table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders are the only two teams to have booked their play-off berth.\n\nThe top four teams make the play-offs, but the first and second-placed sides have the advantage of two chances to qualify for the final on May 26 in Chennai.\n\nPunjab, who had already bowed out of the play-off race, kept the opposition down to 144-9 despite a 34-ball 48 by Riyan Parag.\n\nLeft-arm quick Curran bowled Yashasvi Jaiswal, for four, in the first over and then Samson departed for 18 off Nathan Ellis after a slow start.\n\nParag found Ravichandran Ashwin, who hit 28 off 19 balls, for company and the two attempted to push the scoring in their partnership of 50.\n\nThe rest of the batting faltered against a disciplined attack as Curran, fellow quick Harshal Patel and spinner Rahul Chahal took two wickets each.\n\nNEW DELHI: Fiery fifties from Abishek Porel and Tristan Stubbs helped Delhi Capitals sign off their IPL league phase on a high as they beat Lucknow Super Giants by 19 runs on Tuesday.\n\nThe win took Delhi to 14 points in 14 matches and they remain technically in the mix to reach the play-offs of the T20 tournament, but a run-rate in the negative keeps their chances slim.\n\n“We are still in contention even after the last game,” Delhi skipper Rishabh Pant said after he returned to lead the side following a one-match ban for slow over-rate.\n\n“We had a better chance of qualifying if I would have had a chance to play in the last game (which Delhi lost).”\n\nThe left-handed Porel hit 58 before Stubbs smashed an unbeaten 57 off 25 balls to steer Delhi to 208-4 after being invited to bat first at their high-scoring home venue, Arun Jaitley Stadium.\n\nPant, a left-handed wicketkeeper-batsman, made 33 to cap off an impressive season after he came back in the IPL from a horror car crash in December 2022.\n\n“Personally, it was fantastic to come back,” said Pant, who has been picked in India’s squad for the T20 World Cup next month.\n\n“It was heartening to see the support from entire India.

This could lead to some overseas players arriving in the UK late for the Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has been in discussions with counties, aiming to reach an agreement this week.\n\nAccording to their latest proposal, each Hundred team's host county (or MCC, for London Spirit) would receive a 51 percent share, with the ECB retaining the remaining 49 percent. By the end of the year, the ECB plans to sell this 49 percent share and distribute the revenue among English cricket. This move aims to ensure the financial sustainability of both the Hundred and the English game as a whole.\n\nAlso Read: Glenn Maxwell signs up to play for Washington Freedom in Major League Cricket\n\n\"Who gets what within that 49%? That's where the conversation will be over the next couple of weeks. What’s the best way to spread that money around the 18 counties - if you include the MCC, 19 - to try and create a more sustainable, vibrant foundation for the county system?” Stuart Cain, Warwickshire's chief executive was quoted as saying by ESPN Cricinfo.\n\nCrossover that has caused headaches for organizers\n\nThe Hundred's group stage kicks off on July 23, while Major League Cricket (MLC) concludes on July 28, including knockout matches from July 24.

    "body": "Twelve out of the 24 overseas players under contract in the Hundred could arrive late in the UK\n\nHalf of the overseas players in the men's Hundred could arrive in the UK late this year after Major League Cricket (MLC) confirmed on Tuesday that the two leagues will overlap by six days in July.\n\nLast year, the inaugural season of MLC ended two days before the start of the Hundred but the leagues will clash this year. The Hundred's group stage starts on July 23 while MLC will run until the final on July 28, with the knockout fixtures - which will feature four of the six franchises - starting July 24.\n\nTwelve out of the 24 overseas players under contract in the men's Hundred have already been announced as signings or retentions in MLC and more could follow before the tournament starts on July 5. The vast majority of them will stay in the US until their respective franchises are eliminated.\n\nRelated\n\n'It's not rocket science' - CPL's CEO asks T20 leagues to collaborate on scheduling\n\nMLC: Rashid, Pooran, Boult, Rauf among overseas players retained\n\nTravis Head joins Steven Smith at Washington Freedom for MLC 2024\n\nTexas Super Kings snap up Mitchell for MLC 2024, Shepherd goes to MI New York\n\nESPNcricinfo understands that Stephen Fleming is likely to buck the trend by prioritising the Hundred. Fleming, who is in India with Chennai Super Kings, coaches Texas Super Kings in MLC but his Hundred team, Southern Brave, have received assurances that he will arrive in the UK before their opening fixture on July 24. Fleming did not respond when contacted.\n\nDepending on which MLC franchises reach the playoffs, some Hundred teams could be without two or even three overseas players for their opening fixture. Fleming's Brave, for example, could be missing Kieron Pollard (MI New York), Akeal Hosein (Washington Freedom) and Finn Allen (San Francisco Unicorns) for their first match.\n\nPlayer wages in MLC were higher than in the men's Hundred last year. The top salary in MLC was around US$175,000 (£135,000 approx.) for a minimum of five games across two-and-a-half weeks; in the men's Hundred, the top salary was £125,000 (US$155,000 approx.) for a minimum of eight games across four weeks.\n\nThe men's Hundred is likely to be short on star power for the opening week, also clashing with the third England vs West Indies Test at Edgbaston which runs from July 26-30. Availability is much better in the women's Hundred, where the only relevant clash is a brief overlap with the Asia Cup.\n\nMLC will start on July 5 - a day later than initially planned - and the 21-match group stage will run until July 23. Each team will play seven group fixtures. The four knockout fixtures have been scheduled for July 24 (Eliminator), 25 (Qualifier), 26 (Challenger) and 28 (final). As well as the Hundred, it will directly clash with the Lanka Premier League which is due to run July 1-21.\n\nLike last year, two venues will be used: Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. The ICC said earlier this year that MLC were evaluating the possibility of using the 'modular' stadium in Eisenhower Park, near New York - which will host eight T20 World Cup matches in June - but those plans have been shelved.\n\nMLC has proved particularly attractive to Australian players this year, with Steven Smith, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell and Jake Fraser-McGurk all due to feature. Two MLC franchises have links with Australian states - Washington Freedom (New South Wales) and San Francisco Unicorns (Victorians) - while a Seattle Orcas squad recently toured Queensland.\n\nA desire to attract the best overseas players in the world is among several reasons underpinning the ECB's plan to sell equity stakes in Hundred teams to private investors later this year. Richard Gould, the ECB's chief executive, said last month that there is a \"strong consensus that we would like to see private investment come into the Hundred\".\n\nThe ECB have been meeting counties regularly and hope they will agree on a direction of travel this week. Under their latest proposals, they would gift a 51% share in each Hundred team to its host county (or MCC, in the case of London Spirit) and would sell the other 49% itself by the end of the year, sharing the revenue generated across the English game.\n\n\"Who gets what within that 49%? That's where the conversation will be over the next couple of weeks,\" Stuart Cain, Warwickshire's chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra last week. \"What's the best way to spread that money around the 18 counties - if you include the MCC, 19 - to try and create a more sustainable, vibrant foundation for the county system?\"\n\nMatt Roller is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",

    "title": "Inside the American T20 revolution",
    "date": "",
    "body": "The USA team created history by beating Bangladesh in a T20I series ©USA Cricket\n\n'Jo bhi karna hain bada karna hain! (Aim for the stars, always!) We want to build something that will outlive our lifetimes' quipped MLC (Major League Cricket) co-founder Sameer Mehta, the co-founder of American Cricket Enterprise in 2019 after winning the rights to own and operate a T20 league in USA. It is understood that the bid was unanimously approved by all the sitting directors at USA Cricket at the time over bids from industry incumbents including some of the IPL franchises.\n\nWhat was the catch? ACE inked the deal based on their intent to build cricketing infrastructure in the country, which was virtually non-existent in the country. The erstwhile USACA had zero turf wickets under their ambit in their half a century long existence. The ACE proposal further promised to leverage that infrastructure to build cricketing ecosystems and pathways.\n\nMuch like their peers at GT20 (Canada) or the now-defunct Euro T20, ACE had a chance to launch a flaky T20 league, ensuring a revenue stream right from the onset. But they went down a different route, taking a bottom-to-top approach, the group made heavy investments in setting up academies and turf wicket grounds across the country. The launch of MLC was preceded by the inception of the Minor League (MiLC), a 26-team pathway franchise tournament that now underpins the MLC. ACE launched the MLC, after 2 successful MiLC seasons had laid the initial groundwork and 4 years after clinching the winning bid.\n\nWhile the world watches American cricket basking in the glory of a historic series win over Bangladesh, it is oblivious to the T20 revolution that has been brewing in America since the advent of ACE. The MiLC with over 150 games a year and the long weekend pop-up T20 tournaments like the Houston Open have completely changed the landscape of American cricket.\n\nSomeone like Andries Gous, one of the many fresh faces in the USA lineup, who also enjoys stints at Abu Dhabi T10 and the ILT20 plays around 80 T20 games in a calendar year in USA which is close to a 10-fold increase from what he played in South Africa before moving to the US in 2021.\n\n\"My power game has definitely improved since coming to America, because we play so much T20 cricket. I think I sort of figured the way I want to play T20 cricket in these last three years. I think I'm 100% a better cricketer than I was in 2021 when I left South Africa\" said Gous after his whirlwind knock of 95 in 50 deliveries at the ILT20 in January.\n\nSimilarly left arm spinning all-rounder Harmeet Singh, who re-invented the wheel with a more round-arm action is now the most potent left-arm spinner in the country. He shunned away his fluidly orthodox action, one that was compared to Bishan Bedi because of the amount of T20 cricket he plays in America. It is also in America where Hamreet rediscovered his mojo with the bat. Playing T20 cricket day in and out, he transformed himself from a handy lower-order bat to a serious match-winner at the death, evident with his breathtaking cameo of 33 from 13 in the first T20I against Bangladesh.\n\nThe import of these professionals to spike the quality of cricket in America has raised the bar for the standard of cricket prevalent in America today. The MLC, with its domestic purse of $1.9m to go with MiLC purses of around $400,000 and about another $400,000 of player payments for the long weekend pop-up tournaments in all, the ecosystem now sustains about 35 professional cricketers making close to $60,000 per annum on an average.\n\nThe country now has about 20 turf wicket grounds scattered around the country, the construction of which has been either directly undertaken by ACE or has come up because of a tremendous snowball effect. The emergence of MLC has spiked investment from private groups and benefactors alike and has seen cricketing infrastructure in terms of turf grounds, indoor facilities, and ad-hoc cash tournaments grow by leaps and bounds. An average MiLC team owner burns close to $120,000 in cash every season while ACE has spent around $80m of their own for venue construction, high-performance camps, logistics and player salaries.\n\nThe recent on-field success of the American team has resultantly not been a flash in the pan, but instead, the sweet fruits of thoughtful labour put into the brittle ecosystem of American cricket which had endured many false dawns in the past.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet",

    "body": "The U.S. cricket team which will co-host the Twenty20 World Cup may be a fitting cross-section of its country as a roster of migrants, a melting pot of nationalities and cultures.\n\nThe 15-man squad includes players born in India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa. Home-grown players include vice-captain Aaron Jones, who was born in Queens, and allrounder Steven Taylor, of Hialeah, Florida.\n\nThe team provides a snapshot of U.S. cricket at this formative stage, as Major League Cricket jostles for its place in a crowded sporting market. The squad includes foreign players drawn to America by the MLC and local players given the chance to play cricket at a professional level in the United States\n\nThe home team’s most recognized member is the former New Zealand allrounder Corey Anderson. The 33-year-old Anderson played 13 tests, 49 one-day internationals and 31 T20 internationals for New Zealand between 2013 and 2018 in a career limited by injuries.\n\nHe earned a place in cricket history for his 36-ball century in a one-day international between New Zealand and the West Indies on New Year’s Day, 2014. Anderson also has played in T20 leagues in Australia, India, the Caribbean and United Arab Emirates before finding an MLC home at the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nAnderson made his first half-century for the U.S. in its T20 win over Canada last month.\n\nMumbai-born Harmeet Singh, who played for India at two Under-19 World Cups, was the star for the 19th-ranked U.S. team earlier this week in an upset win over Bangladesh. It the only the second win over a full ICC member for the U.S.\n\nHe scored 33 from the 13 deliveries he faced and shared an unbeaten, match-winning 62-run partnership with Anderson, who was unbeaten on 34.\n\n“It means a lot to us to put on a show against Bangladesh. We are no walkovers,” Harmeet told ESPNcricinfo. “I think our potential is immense.”\n\nThe U.S. meets Canada in the tournament opener on June 1 and then there’ll be a step up for both teams in Group A, which also includes India and Pakistan, fierce cricket rivals with enormous support, and Ireland.\n\nAmong the other foreign-born players on the U.S. squad coached by ex-Australia batter Stuart Law is right-arm fast bowler Ali Khan, who moved with his parents from Pakistan to the United States when he was 18.\n\nHe first played for the U.S. team in 2016 and has also has played in the Indian Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and Pakistan Premier League, in Global T20 Canada and the Afghanistan Premier League.\n\nCaptain Monank Patel, a wicketkeeper-batsman, was born in India and settled in New Jersey after moving permanently to the U.S. in 2016. He played at a junior level for Gujarat in India and played the first of his 47 one-day internationals and 23 T20 internationals for the U.S. in 2019.\n\nAndries Gous, another wicketkeeper-batsmen, was born in Welkom, South Africa, played for South Africa at under-19 level and played 60 first-class matches before relocating to the U.S. in 2021. He and Patel were the highest scorers for the U.S. in the recent five-match series against Canada.\n\nAllrounder Milind Kumar is another India-born player who accumulated nine centuries in 60 first-class appearances for Delhi before making his home in the U.S.\n\nThe Canada team scheduled to meet the U.S. in the opening match is also a team drawn from many places and shaped by the evolution of a professional league at home.\n\nCanada will be led by the veteran left-armer spinner Saad bin Zafar, who was born in Pakistan. He moved to Canada to study and was first named in the Canadian T20 team in 2008. Now 37, he has played 38 T20 internationals and once took two wickets without conceding a run in four overs in a T20 against Panama.\n\nJamaica-born batter Aaron Johnson, Pakistan-born left-arm fast bowler Kaleem Sana and Guyana-born right-arm quick Dillon Heyliger reflect the international makeup of the team which is coached by former Sri Lanka international Pubudu Dassanayake.\n\n___\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",

    "date": "Sat Dec 16 12:21:43 2023",
    "body": "Table of Contents\n\nThe second season of America’s marquee T20 league, Major League Cricket (MLC) will commence on America’s Independence Day i.e., July 4. The organizers had to start the tournament in July as the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 is expected to be played in June and will conclude just four days before the start of MLC. The T20 World Cup will be hosted by West Indies and the USA.\n\nThe first season of the MLC was concluded early due to international window constraints. The matches in the first season were played in the round-robin format. However, this time around, it is being planned to keep the league in a home-away double round-robin league format. Major League Cricket’s first season saw six teams competing against each other.\n\nMLC has not disclosed the venues for the second season. It is understood that there are possibilities that MLC could add two more venues for season 2. Apart from the Grand Prairie and Morrisville venues, Major League Cricket looks keen on leveraging the pop-up venue in Long Island, NY with a 34000 seating capacity set to be erected by the ICC for the T20 World Cup. The upcoming facility at George Mason University has been identified by the MLC for warm-up matches of the World Cup.\n\nAlso Read: Mohammed Shami Ruled Out Of India’s Test Series, Deepak Chahar To Miss ODI Series Due To Family Emergency\n\nMajor League Cricket (MLC) Provides A Perfect Platform For American Cricket\n\n“The tremendous success of the inaugural Major League Cricket season provides a perfect platform to propel American cricket to even greater heights in 2024,” said Justin Geale, Tournament Director, Major League Cricket. “We expect to see even more world-class players participating in season two of Major League Cricket, creating an incredible summer for the sport in America along with the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.”\n\nThe inaugural season of MLC attracted some top signings at large signing amounts surpassing established leagues like the Big Bash League and the SA20 League in average salary per league game. The second season of Major League Cricket is expected to retain most of the white-ball players that featured in the last season as the window stands clear of any white-ball cricket scheduled for teams like England, Australia, New Zealand, West Indies, and Pakistan.\n\nMI New York won the inaugural season of the Major League Cricket and the franchise will be looking to win another season.

    "body": "The anticipation is growing for the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) as the American professional T20 competition looks to capitalize on a successful debut. The upcoming season is set to kick off on July 5 with a double header between defending champions MI New York and Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season’s final. The tournament will conclude on July 27, with the latter stages overlapping with England’s Hundred competition. MLC officials initially aimed for a mid-June to mid-July schedule to avoid clashes, but the T20 World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S, ended in late June this year.\n\nMLC has seen high demand for pre-sale tickets since announcing the season’s schedule, indicating a growing enthusiasm for cricket in America. Chief Executive Vijay Srinivasan expressed delight in providing fans across the nation the opportunity to witness top-tier cricket live in their own backyard. The success of the first season has set a foundation for MLC to establish itself as one of the premier T20 leagues in the world. The goal is to continue expanding the sport in the United States and engage the community, both as fans and participants.\n\nAttendance numbers for last season were impressive, with around 70,000 fans turning out for the tournament played at venues such as the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the Church Street Park in Morrisville. The second season will see an expansion of six games, with teams set to play seven matches in the group stages leading up to four playoff games. While MLC officials aim to eventually have a home-and-away season, this will only be feasible once all franchises have home grounds. Player wages in the league will remain competitive, with top players earning $175,000 for a minimum of five games.\n\nMLC has been able to attract marquee Australian signings, such as Steve Smith, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head, due to Australia having no international commitments after the T20 World Cup. The league exceeded financial targets in its debut season, generating revenues of $8 million. The success of the league’s first season can be attributed in part to its novelty factor, but there is optimism that MLC will continue to grow in its second season both on and off the field. With momentum from a historic T20 World Cup and a strong fan base, MLC is poised for another successful season as it aims to establish itself as a premier T20 league in the world.",

    "body": "Salary caps will not increase, according to sources, but player wages will remain in the top echelons of T20 professional leagues as America's Major League Cricket unveiled an expanded schedule for its second season.\n\nThe six-team MLC made a historic debut last season as cricket continues a determined push into the world's biggest sports market. As I reported, the MLC exceeded financial targets with revenues of $8 million, but that has not led to an increase in salary caps, according to sources, for the upcoming season played in July.\n\nSalary caps for teams are set to remain the same, but top players will still be handsomely remunerated and earn $175,000 for a minimum of five games - rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nIt's led to many stars from major cricket nations lured to the U.S, including from powerhouse Australia who don't play international cricket in July unlike last year when they had an Ashes tour.\n\nLike last season, teams will be allowed six overseas players per starting eleven, according to sources, which is more than the quota of four accepted in established leagues.\n\nAmid an outcry, fearing the sanctity of international cricket, governing body the International Cricket Council tightened regulations last year with teams in official T20 leagues only allowed to field four overseas players.\n\nThe rule did not come into effect for the MLC or the well-heeled UAE league, but it is believed the MLC is targeting to comply with the ICC regulations in the coming seasons.\n\nThe upcoming MLC season was officially unveiled on Tuesday and will run from July 5-28, with the pointy end of its season set to clash with the Hundred, the 100-ball competition in England.\n\nThe American tournament will expand by six games with teams to play seven matches in the group stages ahead of the four playoff games concluding with the final on July 28. MLC officials and owners want a home-and-away season - where the teams play each other twice - to underpin the competition, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds.\n\nLike last year, the entire tournament will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina. There had been hope that New York's modular stadium being built for June's T20 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S. - costing $30 million as I reported last month - could host games in the MLC.\n\nBut that won't ensue with an unknown over the ground at Nassau County Stadium in Eisenhower Park, 30 miles east of Manhattan, after the T20 World Cup.\n\nAccording to sources, the MLC hopes to carve out space in the calendar from mid-June to mid-July to avoid schedule clashes with the Hundred. But that was not possible this season due to the T20 World Cup finishing on June 29.\n\nThe MLC's season opener will be a blockbuster between defending champions MI New York and Seattle Orcas at Morrisville in a rematch of last season's final.",
    "summary": "**Key Points:**\n\n* The MLC's second season will have an expanded schedule, running from July 5-28.\n* Despite exceeding financial targets with $8 million in revenue in its debut season, salary caps will not increase.\n* Top players will still earn a minimum of $175,000 for at least five games, rivaling the highest figures in T20 leagues outside of the Indian Premier League.\n* Teams will be allowed six overseas players per starting eleven, more than the ICC-regulated quota of four.\n* The tournament will have seven group stage matches and four playoff games, concluding with the final on July 28.\n* The entire tournament will be played in Dallas and Morrisville, North Carolina, with hopes to have a home-and-away season in the future when all franchises have home grounds.\n* The season opener will feature defending champions MI New York against Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season's final.",

    "title": "Major League Cricket’s expansion plan poses a threat to English competitions",
    "date": "Mon May 27 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the US. In a move that will have significant implications for the landscape of the professional sport in England, MLC, which began with a 19-game season, has confirmed it will expand to 34 games by 2025.\n\nThe US league now has six franchises but plans to launch two more in the near future, and two more soon after that. The announcement comes just after MLC has been fully legitimised by the news that its matches have been awarded List A status by the International Cricket Council.\n\n“It was always intended to be a 10‑team league,” the MLC chief exe­cutive, Vijay Srinivasan, told the ­Guardian. “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support 10 teams, so that’s our plan. We had 19 games in our first season, will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nThe second season, which starts at the end of the men’s T20 World Cup, runs for 23 days and overlaps with the Hundred. The US tournament next year will be significantly longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC is keen to play in June.\n\n“Ultimately for us our ideal calen­dar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,” Srinivasan said. The tournament was pushed back this year because of the T20 World Cup, which is using the MLC’s stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas. “With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nThat would clash with the T20 Blast season but leave the Hundred to run from late July through August.\n\nEnglish cricket has already had to adapt to sharing its summer with a competing league. Last year Jason Roy gave up his England contract so he could take a job with LA Knight Riders, while Surrey’s Sunil Narine skipped the county side’s appearance on Blast finals day because he was also playing for LA. Alec Stewart, Surrey’s director of cricket, said at the time it was “disappointing and frustrating” to “lose a player of ­Narine’s quality at late notice”. Narine’s ­decision was a sobering reminder of the status of English domestic cricket.\n\nMLC’s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed that it was the “direction of travel” for the game on 10 May, but there is frustration about slow progress. MLC boasts a formidable array of investors, including four IPL sides – Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals – as well as significant business figures such as Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella.\n\n“All of these people who came on board with us when we started five years ago have been immensely successful in other walks of life,” Srinivasan said. “You know they understand that this is not one of those things where you can just turn a switch. The expectation was never that this would be an overnight transition. They’ve been immensely patient and they’ve backed us all the way through.”\n\nMLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local ­players. It is now working on ­developing more List A venues. “We’re not here to play a league and go away every year,” Srinivasan said.\n\n“We feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think 10 years from now, I think you’ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we’ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.”",
    "summary": "**Expansion Plans:** The MLC is expanding its season from 19 games to 34 games by 2025.

Rich Indian businesspeople and celebrities have contributed more than AU$174 million to the six-team competition, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nardella and Bollywood icon Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nIPL 2023 | Australia tour of India 2023 | Dream11 Prediction | Fantasy Cricket Tips | Cricket Match Prediction Today | Cricket News | Cricket Live Score\n\nMight See A Lot Of Steve Smith In The USA: MLC Co-founder Sameer Mehta\n\nThere is a $1.5 million pay ceiling for each of the six franchises, which are located in Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Seattle, and New York City. Each franchise may sign up to seven international talents. Last week, Cricket NSW established a strategic alliance with MLC that would let American players compete in the American T20 event and Australian players play in NSW Premier Cricket.\n\nNew South Wales is anticipated to provide players and personnel for the squad as part of CNSW’s high-performance collaboration with the Washington DC franchise.\n\nIPL 2023 | India National Cricket Team | IND vs AUS 2023 | India vs Australia 2023\n\n“With the global cricket landscape currently undergoing significant transition, we view the United States as a market with immense growth potential,” CNSW chief executive Lee Germon said in a statement.\n\n“Cricket NSW’s track record in high performance cricket and elite match operations is second to none and we believe we can bring a raft of experience to MLC and the Washington D.C. franchise in the coming years.”\n\nSteve Smith, who has made New York his second home, won’t be able to participate in the MLC tournament this year because it conflicts with the Ashes, according to News Corp, but the 33-year-old has reportedly been in contact with the competition’s organizers about a 2024 participation.\n\nIn June of next year, when the Men’s T20 World Cup is set to begin in the United States and the West Indies, Steve Smith may find himself without a job.\n\n“We’ve been in touch with Steve about his plans and what he’s thinking,” MLC co-founder Sameer Mehta told News Corp.\n\n“What he’d love to do at some point is play cricket in the US as his schedule permits.\n\n“His view was that if he could make it work and if we could make it work – I know this season, he has commitments. I don’t know what the Australian calendar is next year but I believe there is enough space for him to potentially play.”\n\n“Long-term … our view is that we might see a lot of him in the US.”\n\nSteve Smith Interested About Cricket In USA\n\nWhen asked about finishing his career as a player in the United States, where he and his wife Dani announced their engagement in 2017, sTEVE Smith commented earlier this summer that it would be “quite great.”\n\n“There’s obviously leagues popping up everywhere around the world now, and I think you’ll probably see more players in the back end of their career going down that route, so it’s potentially something I’ll look at in the future,” Steve Smith told the Sydney Morning Herald in September.\n\n“The US has been a market that cricket’s been trying to get into for some time. So yeah, I think it’d be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nA rising market for cricket has been identified as the United States, where a sizable South Asian diaspora and the country’s financial clout are accelerating the growth of the game.\n\nOn July 13 in Texas, the MLC’s inaugural season is scheduled to start.",

    "body": "Anticipation is building for the second season of Major League Cricket as the lucrative American professional T20 competition aims to build on a successful debut.\n\nThe upcoming season starts on July 5 with a double header between defending champions MI New York and Seattle Orcas in a rematch of last season's final at Morrisville, North Carolina, while Texas Super Kings plays LA Knight Riders in the later fixture in Dallas.\n\nThe final will be played on July 27, with the latter parts of the tournament clashing with the Hundred, the high-profile 100-ball competition in England.\n\nAs I reported recently, MLC officials want the tournament to be held annually from mid-June to mid-July to avoid clashes, but this year was not possible due to the T20 World Cup - co-hosted by the U.S - only finishing in late June.\n\nThe MLC hierarchy are bullish that momentum from a historic T20 World Cup, with games played in New York, Dallas and Florida, can spill over after pre-sale tickets have been in \"high demand\" since the season's schedule was unveiled.\n\nStandard tickets start at $30. “The enthusiasm for cricket in America is increasing rapidly, and we are delighted to provide fans across the nation the opportunity to witness top-tier cricket live in their own backyard,\" MLC chief executive Vijay Srinivasan said.\n\n\"The success of the first season has given us a foundation to establish one of the premier T20 leagues in the world.\n\n\"Our goal is to keep expanding the sport in the United States and offer the community an opportunity to engage with it, whether as fans or participants.\"\n\nAttendances last season were strong with around 70,000 fans turning out to the 18-day tournament played at the 7200 capacity Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas and the more modest Church Street Park in Morrisville.\n\nThe second season will expand by six games with teams to play seven matches in the group stages ahead of four playoff games. MLC officials and owners want a home-and-away season - where the teams play each other twice - to underpin the competition, but that is likely to only happen when all the franchises have home grounds.\n\nAs I reported previously, salary caps will not increase but player wages will remain in the top echelons of T20 professional leagues. Top players will still be well remunerated and earn $175,000 for a minimum of five games - rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nMLC has benefited from powerhouse Australia having no international commitments after the T20 World Cup. It has led to a barrage of marquee Australian signings, including legendary Steve Smith, emerging star batter Jake Fraser-McGurk and last year's World Cup heroes Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head.\n\nAs I first reported, MLC exceeded financial targets in its debut season with revenues of $8 million.\n\nUndoubtedly the novelty factor helped its long-awaited launch. But, as excitement continues to build, there is growing optimism that MLC will be even more successful on-and-off the field in its second season.",

    "body": "by Smit Patel • Published on\n\nMLC will be recognised as official List A cricket from the second season onwards © MLC\n\nUSA's flagship T20 tournament, Major League Cricket (MLC) is eyeing a possible expansion to 10 teams. The MLC announced it will be expanding to an 8 team tournament within the space of two seasons and add two more to make it a 10 team franchise tournament eventually. The first season was played out in a single round robin format within 6 teams consisting of 19 games in a 3 week window.\n\nWhile the second season will see an increase of 6 games, the league is further expected to grow with a home and away format in the future. In a 10 team league, the actual number of games are set to spike up to close to 100 games.\n\nIn a major shot in the arm for the MLC, the ICC put its weight behind this $120m fledgling league by imparting a List A status to its games. Inherently, all domestic T20 games in associate nations are left bereft of the List A status but ICC's approval for the List A status is an endorsement of the quality of cricket at display at the inaugural season of the MLC.\n\n\"We saw cricket mania sweep across the US last year off the back of our inaugural season of Major League Cricket. Now, we take exciting momentum into the highly anticipated ICC T20 World Cup and season two of the MLC\" said Vijay Srinivasan CEO of MLC\n\n\"With an unforgettable summer of cricket on our doorstep, we're ready to capture the hearts of American sports fans with our thrilling, adrenaline-charged game that is the most exciting emerging T20 tournament across the globe\" added Srinivasan.\n\nThe prospects of MLC propelling itself to be a 10 team tournament is seen as a bit unsettling to the English game. In its full glory MLC, may ultimately carve out a 10 week window for itself to accommodate the home and away format for all of its 10 teams. As it stands, the MLC is well placed in a buffer between the IPL and the Hundred in the cricket calendar. With American and English summers overlapping, there is a high chance the MLC and competitions like the Blast and Hundred duel it out to attract and reserve top talent within their windows.\n\nMeanwhile, the American cricketing juggernaut has rolled along quietly on and off the field. The success of the inaugural season of the MLC has stimulated sponsorship from industry leaders like Cognizant and Stake. It is understood that the title sponsor Cognizant has pledged in close to $2m for the upcoming season. Furthermore, the USA men's historic series win over Bangladesh in the build up to their first world cup augurs well for American cricket, which finds itself in the midst of a T20 revolution.\n\n© Cricbuzz",

    "body": "Women's cricket could soon have a potential women's T20 franchise tournament in the United States. While still in the early stages, influential stakeholders in American cricket seem keen to capitalize on the unique window of opportunity presented. This is due to the country's hosting of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the recent success of the inaugural Major League Cricket (MLC) men's T20 tournament.\n\nWith cricket set to make its Olympic debut in 2028 and the USA women's national team likely to qualify as hosts, there is a growing realization of the need to develop the women's game domestically. The remarkable rise of the Women's Premier League (WPL) in India, where stars worldwide earned good salaries, has further highlighted the commercial potential of women's T20 cricket.\n\nWhile the project is still in the talking stage, the proposed tournament would aim to attract the world's best players and potentially operate alongside the existing men's franchises in the MLC.\n\nSeveral MLC franchise owners, including the Ambani family that owns MI New York, have expressed interest in developing women's teams. This move could significantly boost the profile and earning potential of women's cricketers globally.\n\nAlso read: Threat looms over marquee event as weather destroys facilities to cancel USA-Bangladesh warm up fixture\n\nUSA to host its first ICC event\n\nIf the plans materialize, it could have far-reaching implications for the international commitments of England's women cricketers and their participation in domestic tournaments like The Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has already taken steps to increase earnings for its domestic women's players, but compared to the offers in the WPL, there is still less.\n\nLaunching a women's T20 franchise league in the USA would mark a significant milestone for the game.

    "body": "Six-team MLC to initially grow to eight franchises before adding two more\n\nCompetition awarded List A status by ICC\n\nJune start would mean clash with England’s T20 Blast\n\nUS Twenty20 competition Major League Cricket (MLC) plans to expand to ten teams as part of efforts to grow the sport in the country.\n\nThe six-team tournament will hold its second season from 5th to 28th July, which will see half a dozen more matches played compared to the 19 for the inaugural campaign in 2023. The US is also preparing to co-host the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup alongside the West Indies, with games to be played in Florida, New York and Texas.\n\nMLC currently has franchises based in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Texas and Washington, but intends to add two new teams in the near future and two more soon after that.\n\n“It was always intended to be a ten‑team league,” MLC chief exe­cutive Vijay Srinivasan told The Guardian. “Studies show that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support team teams, so that’s our plan.\n\n“We had 19 games in our first season, [we] will have 25 in our second. I think we want to get to 34 next year, and just gradually keep expanding.”\n\nSrinivasan added that the league was eager to play in June and have that month as its permanent calendar spot.\n\n“Ultimately for us our ideal calen­dar is to start much earlier, in the late spring or early summer,” he said. “The tournament was pushed back this year because of the T20 World Cup, which is using the MLC’s stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\n“With the Indian Premier League ending in late May, I think our sweet spot would be to start in early June, which is when we have the school holidays in the US, and go into July. That’s how we would like to establish our window.”\n\nThe announcement arrives shortly after the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarded MLC matches with List A status – one of the three major forms of cricket recognised by the game’s global governing body. It sees MLC become the second associate-nation-run T20 tournament to attain List A status, following the International League T20 (ILT20) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nAs well as aiming to make MLC one of cricket’s top domestic T20 leagues, perhaps even second only to the Indian Premier League (IPL), organisers have established academies and a minor league system to develop local players. They are also working on building more List A venues, including grounds for MLC teams.\n\n“We’re not here to play a league and go away every year,” said Srinivasan.\n\n“We feel like it is our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think ten years from now, I think you’ll see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of venues around the country, we’ll have a home-and-away sort of format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger pool of players as a result in the system. Hopefully that means we will also have a very strong sort of USA team. Those are all our ambitions.”\n\nSportsPro says…\n\nIf MLC is a success, it has the potential to alter the economics of cricket – a sport where India remains far and away its most lucrative market.\n\nHowever, another domestic T20 league poses a headache for rival competitions, notably in England. This year’s MLC season, which starts less than a week after the Men’s T20 World Cup concludes, will partly overlap with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s (ECB) The Hundred, which takes place from 23rd July to 18th August.\n\nA June start from 2025 for MLC would mean The Hundred could run unopposed but would result in a clash with the T20 Blast, another English domestic competition, and put counties at risk of losing players to MLC. This year’s T20 Blast is pencilled in from 30th May to 14th September.\n\nThe arrival of MLC has also led to further pressure for a decision on allowing private investment into The Hundred to help it compete with rival franchise competitions. This is partly due to MLC’s enviable set of investors, with four of its teams controlled by IPL franchise owners – the Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals, Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella also co-owns the Seattle Orcas.\n\nIn April, the ECB revealed it had begun the process of securing private investment in The Hundred. The national governing body, along with England’s 18 first-class counties and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), agreed earlier this month that external funding was the “direction of travel” for the English game but there is frustration about the slow progress.\n\nMLC and the wider growth of cricket in the US are key priorities for the ICC. However, the league’s emergence has left other competitions, aside from the IPL, wary as they seek to retain market share.\n\nGet your daily briefing of all the essential news across the sports industry with the SportsPro Daily Newsletter.

    "body": "Major League Cricket (MLC), the young American T20 league, has secured a significant milestone with the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarding it List A status. This recognition elevates the MLC to the status of an official T20 league, with player performances now holding official weight in their career statistics.\n\nList A Status: Recognition and Opportunity\n\n“We are really excited for the news as it’s a recognition of the standard and high quality of players taking part in the tournament,” said MLC tournament director Justin Geale. The List A status validates the MLC’s efforts in establishing a top-tier T20 competition in the USA. It also presents an opportunity to showcase American cricket on a global scale.\n\n“By awarding MLC List A status for the upcoming season, it assists to acknowledge the strength and growing stature of the tournament and ultimately will help to enhance the credibility of the sport in the USA on a global scale,” Geale elaborated. More importantly, this recognition ensures that the achievements of players in the MLC will be reflected accurately in their official statistics.\n\nExpansion Plans and Scheduling Ambitions\n\nBuilding on this momentum, the MLC has ambitious plans for expansion. The league currently features six teams, but according to MLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan, this will grow to ten teams over the next few years. This expansion will be accompanied by an increase in matches, from 19 in 2023 to 34 by 2025.\n\nSrinivasan also revealed the league’s ideal calendar window. He envisions an early June start, coinciding with the conclusion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the beginning of US school holidays. This timeframe would allow the MLC to establish its own window without directly conflicting with the Hundred, a rival T20 league played in England and Wales.\n\nPotential Scheduling Conflicts and Overlap with the Hundred\n\nHowever, the MLC’s desired June start might create some overlap with the English T20 Blast competition. A similar scheduling conflict arose last year when England’s Jason Roy opted to play in the MLC instead of fulfilling his contract with the ECB. This situation highlights the complexities of scheduling multiple T20 leagues across the globe.\n\nThe upcoming season will see a six-day overlap with the Hundred, with the MLC concluding on July 28th and the Hundred starting on July 23rd. This overlap could potentially impact the availability of overseas players who might be participating in both leagues. Significantly, twelve out of the twenty-four overseas players currently contracted with the Hundred have already played or are signed up to play in the MLC.\n\nStrong Foundation with IPL Backing\n\nFour of the six MLC franchises are owned by established IPL teams – Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings, and Delhi Capitals. This strong backing from experienced IPL ownership groups provides the MLC with a solid foundation for growth and development.\n\nThe inaugural MLC season, held in July 2023, saw MI New York emerge victorious under the captaincy of Nicholas Pooran. The upcoming season will be played across the same two venues as the first – Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas and Church Street Park Stadium in Morrisville.\n\nWith List A status and ambitious expansion plans, Major League Cricket is poised to play a significant role in the development of American cricket. The coming season promises exciting competition and strategic manoeuvring as the MLC carves its own niche in the ever-evolving T20 landscape.",

This decision comes just a week before MLC kicks off its second season and less than a week before the Americas host the T20 World Cup.\n\nMLC is now recognized as the official T20 league in America, making it the country’s first world-class domestic tournament. With this new status, every century, half-century, run-out, win, loss, and championship will be officially documented in an internationally recognized format of the game.\n\nThe CEO of MLC, Vijay Srinivasan, recently announced plans to expand the tournament from 19 games in 2023 to 34 by 2025. He expressed excitement about the growth of cricket in the US and the upcoming season of MLC, which has gained popularity among American sports fans.\n\nSanctioned by USA Cricket, MLC attracted players from around the world in its inaugural season, with teams like Los Angeles Knight Riders, MI New York, San Francisco Unicorns, Seattle Orcas, Texas Super Kings, and the Washington Freedom participating. The granting of List-A status to MLC reflects the league’s commitment to delivering premier cricket in the United States and providing local players with international recognition.\n\nOverall, this development is a significant step forward in the growth and development of cricket in the US, and it is expected to further enhance the popularity of the sport in the country.",

This means official player statistics from the MLC will now be recognized alongside other major T20 leagues worldwide.\n\nRecognition for Growing Tournament\n\n“We are really excited for the news,” said tournament director Justin Geale. This recognition from the ICC validates the quality of players and the high standard of competition in the MLC.\n\nThis status boost will not only enhance the credibility of cricket in the USA but also ensures “the performances of some of the world’s best players are adequately reflected in their career statistics,” Geale added.\n\nExpansion and scheduling ambitions of MLC\n\nThe upcoming season, kicking off on July 5th, will see the MLC expand its footprint. Plans are in place to grow from the current six teams to ten over the next few years, with a corresponding increase in matches from 19 to 34 by 2025.\n\nMLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan also revealed their ideal calendar would involve an earlier June start, potentially capitalizing on the American school holidays and avoiding clashes with other major leagues. However, this could lead to some overlap with England’s T20 Blast.\n\nAlarm bells for ECB, CA\n\nWith several MLC teams owned by IPL franchises, there’s a chance of player overlap with England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) owned The Hundred, another T20 league starting in late July. As many as half of the Hundred’s overseas players might arrive late due to their MLC commitments.\n\nThe Cricket Australia (CA) will also be looking at this development regarding MLC with sharp eyes as USA’s T20 league will be direct competitor of CA’s Big Bash League (BBL) in future.\n\nBright Future for cricket in USA\n\nDespite these potential scheduling hurdles, the MLC’s List A status and ambitious expansion plans are positive signs for the growth of cricket in the USA.

    "date": "Mon May 27 12:49:30 2024",
    "body": "Major League Cricket has announced ambitious new expansion plans for the sport in the US. In a move that will have significant implications for the landscape of professional sport in England, MLC, which started with a 19-match season, has confirmed it will expand to 34 matches by 2025. The league currently includes six franchises, but plans to have two more in the near future, and two more soon after. The announcement comes just after MLC was fully legitimized by the news that its matches have been granted List A status by the International Cricket Council.\n\n“It was always intended to be a 10-team league,” MLC CEO Vijay Srinivasan told The Guardian. “Research shows that we are a big enough country, with a big enough demographic to support ten teams, so that is our plan. We had 19 games in our first season and will have 25 in our second. I think we want to go to 34 next year and just gradually expand further.” The second season, which starts at the end of the World T20, lasts 23 days and overlaps with the Hundred. Next year’s edition will last considerably longer and start earlier. Srinivasan said MLC would like to play in June.\n\n“Ultimately, our ideal calendar for us is to start much earlier, in late spring or early summer,” Srinivasan said. The tournament was postponed this year due to the Men’s T20 World Cup, which uses the MLC Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas. “With the Indian Premier League ending at the end of May, I think our best bet would be to start in early June, when we have the school holidays in the US, and then start in July. This is how we would like to decorate our shop window.” That would clash with the T20 Blast season, but the Hundred would run from late July to August.\n\nEnglish cricket has already had to adapt to sharing the summer with a rival league. Last year, Jason Roy gave up his England contract so he could take a job with the LA Knight Riders, while Surrey’s Sunil Narine skipped Surrey’s appearance on Blast final day as he also played for LA. Surrey’s director of cricket, Alec Stewart, said at the time that it was “disappointing and frustrating” to “lose a player of Narine’s quality late on”. Narine’s decision was a sobering reminder of the status of English domestic cricket.\n\nThe MLC’s expansion plans will also increase pressure on the English game to decide whether or not to bring private investment into the Hundred. The England and Wales Cricket Board, the 18 counties and Marylebone Cricket Club agreed this was the “direction of travel” for the match on May 10, but there is frustration at the slow progress. MLC boasts a formidable array of investors, including four IPL sides – the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Mumbai Indians, the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi Capitals – as well as key business people such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n“All these people who came to us when we started five years ago have been hugely successful in other walks of life,” Srinivasan said. switch. The expectation was never that this would be an overnight transition. They have been extremely patient and supported us all the way.” MLC has already established a series of academies and a minor league system to develop local players. Work is now underway to develop more List A sites.\n\n“We are not here to play a league and go away every year,” Srinivasan added. “We feel like our role is to build the infrastructure for cricket in the US. MLC is the means to an end, if you will. I think in ten years you will see a very different landscape for cricket in the US. We’ll have a very robust set of locations across the country, we’ll have a sort of home and away format for MLC, and we’ll have a much larger player pool in the system as a result. Hopefully this means we’ll have a very strong kind of American team as well. Those are all our ambitions.”",

    "date": "Thu Feb  1 03:23:52 2024",
    "body": "Ricky Ponting has forged a reputation as one of the most astute minds in world cricket and now the Aussie legend could be taking that knowledge with him to the United States. The former Aussie captain has confirmed he is in talks to coach the Washington Freedom in America's Major League Cricket (MLC).\n\nThe United States launched its first major foray into the world of cricket with the introduction of the MLC in 2023 - a T20 competition comprised of six teams from a number of America's biggest cities. MI New York were crowned inaugural champions after defeating the Seattle Orcas in the championship final, with the majority of the matches played in front of sold-out stadiums in Texas and North Carolina.\n\nOH NO: Will Pucovski ruled out of Sheffield Shield game amid fresh blow\n\nBRUTAL: Michael Clarke mocked in savage moment at Aussie cricket awards\n\nNOT GOOD: Ellyse Perry and Nathan Lyon dudded amid Mitch Marsh triumph\n\nThe US-based competition is part of the ICC's push for cricket's expansion into the lucrative North American market, and Ponting's inclusion would be a massive boon for both the MLC and the sport. The legendary former Australian captain is deciding whether he can commit to both the MLC and commentary duties for the T20 World Cup, which will be held in North America in June.\n\nRicky Ponting confirms talks with Washington Freedom\n\nThe second edition of MLC will begin just four days after the World Cup final is played in Barbados on June 30. \"We're not there yet, I haven't committed to anything just yet, but I've had some initial discussions (with Washington),\" Ponting told SEN radio on Thursday.\n\n\"The time of the year sort of fits in OK for me, but I've got a really hectic off-season again. When I say off-season, there's no such thing as an off-season for cricketers anymore.\"\n\nPonting is currently head coach of the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the head of strategy for Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League (BBL) and one of the chief commentators on the Seven Network's free-to-air cricket coverage in Australia. \"It's potentially another big year of time away if I want it, so there are things I've got to work through,\" Ponting said. \"If I'm actually going to be commentating the T20 World Cup or not and if I'm not doing that, where does MLC fit in?\"\n\nPonting would be a tremendous addition to a Washington Freedom side that made it to the MLC eliminator final last year, with his knowledge of the game and tactical awareness among the best in the sport. Not to mention the commercial and public relations possibilities that come with having one of the game's greatest ever players attached to the competition.\n\nIndia's influence in the fledgling US-based competition is evidenced by the fact three out of the six teams share part of their names with IPL franchises. Aussie states have also shown a willingness to form strategic partnerships with the US teams, with Cricket Victoria aligning itself with the San Francisco Unicorns and Queensland Cricket announcing a collaboration with the Seattle Orcas.\n\nCricket NSW also share a partnership with the Washington Freedom, with Greg Shipperd central to the relationship between the two parties. The Aussie coach led the Washington side in its inaugural season and recently took over as the NSW state coach, having managed the Sydney Sixers since 2015 in the BBL.\n\nIf Ponting is named as Shipperd's successor at Washington, he would become the latest big name in Aussie cricket to join the MLC. Aussie ODI World Cup winners Marcus Stoinis and Adam Zampa, as well as white-ball stars Matthew Wade and Aaron Finch were all part of the MLC's inaugural season.\n\nRicky Ponting's cricket brain continues to amaze\n\nWashington would no doubt be hoping that Ponting could bring some of the cricketing genius that he continues to showcase in his commentary role for Seven. Ponting's commentary predictions have become legendary in recent years, with the 168-Test legend showing why he's regarded as the smartest man in cricket during Australia's Test series against the West Indies.\n\nPonting successfully called Alex Carey's downfall on day two of the Windies' historic Gabba Test win in Brisbane. It came as Usman Khawaja and Carey were left to try and rescue Australia's innings after a top order collapse against the underdogs. Khawaja and Carey combined for a 65-run partnership to steady the ship for Australia, but Ponting noticed Carey was starting to become frustrated with his own scoring rate.\n\n\"It looks like his eyes are spinning. He is in overdrive and wants to hit every ball,\" Ponting said. \"I agree with you Bish (West Indies great Ian Bishop), just go a bit more defensive and make him play a big shot from a good length ball.\" As Ponting finished his tactical analysis, Shamar Joseph charged in and delivered a ball at Carey's chest.\n\nCarey mistimed a pull shot and the ball went directly to the West Indies fielder. Once again Ponting had a premonition about a wicket after also displaying his clairvoyant powers 24 hours earlier. On that occasion, Ponting suggested the West Indies batting duo should rotate the strike at the end of day one or risk losing a late wicket.\n\nThat same over, Alzarri Joseph was dismissed on the final ball of the day after Kevin Sinclair had refused a single. The two examples were just the latest in a growing list of brilliant calls from Ponting, whose ability to predict what's about to happen in a cricket match is becoming legendary.",
    "summary": "* The MLC is a T20 competition in the United States that was launched in 2023 with six teams from major American cities.\n* The inaugural season's champion was MI New York, who defeated the Seattle Orcas in the championship final.\n* The competition is part of the ICC's effort to expand cricket into the North American market.\n* Ricky Ponting, a former Australian captain, is in talks to coach the Washington Freedom, one of the MLC teams.\n* Ponting's addition would be a significant boost to the MLC and cricket in general, given his tactical awareness and knowledge of the game.\n* The second edition of the MLC is set to begin just four days after the T20 World Cup final in June.\n* Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises have influenced the naming of three MLC teams, while Australian states have formed partnerships with US teams, such as Cricket NSW with the Washington Freedom.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify or expand on any of these points!",

Jolly shame!\"\n\nWhile other cricketers in the league have also expressed concerns over having to \"rush the game,\" preliminary polls of the three or four people who actually watch cricket have shown that the change is quite popular.\n\n\"It makes it much easier to watch cricket now that I don't have to take two weeks' vacation every time I want to catch a game,\" said Robert Brown, avid fan of the New Delhi BumblyBowlers. \"I have so much more time now to do other things, like eat and see my family. It was sorely needed.\"\n\nAt publishing time, the innovation had succeeded in bringing the length of MLC cricket matches down to a record 7 days, 4 hours, and 37 minutes.\n\nWant proof that Jesus was a woke socialist?

    "body": "Click here for today’s sports betting tips from our expert analysts!\n\nAfter finishing rock-bottom of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket in 2023, the Los Angeles Knight Riders began this season well with a victory but now come into this one on the back of back-to-back defeats. The San Francisco Unicorns have picked up one win with one defeat in their opening two matches ahead of this clash in North Carolina.\n\nDATE & TIME: Saturday 13th July, 2024 - USA ET – 3:00pm / USA PT – 12:00pm / West Indies – 2:00pm / UK – 8:00pm / South Africa – 9:00pm / Sunday 14th July, 2024 - Pakistan – 12:00am / India – 12:30am / Bangladesh – 1:00am / Australia – 5:00am\n\nVENUE: Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina, United States\n\nWEATHER: 32c o 89.6 F with rain forecast at the start of the match\n\nHOW TO WATCH ON TV: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports / South Africa – ESPN / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – N/A\n\nHOW TO WATCH ONLINE: USA – Willow TV / West Indies – TBA / UK – TNT Sports app / South Africa – ESPN+ app / Pakistan – A Sports / India – TBA / Bangladesh – TBA / Australia – Amazon Prime Video\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS FORM: THE SHODDY LAKR\n\nThe Los Angeles Knight Riders began the 2024 Major League Cricket season with an impressive defence of what seemed to be a fairly small total when the Texas Super Kings fell 12 runs short of LAKR’s 162-7. Since then, though, they could not defend 165-6 against the San Francisco Unicorns and then also suffered a nine-wicket thumping to last season’s runners’ up, the Seattle Orcas.\n\nLAST THREE: LLWWL\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS FORM: BOUNCING BACK\n\nThe San Francisco Unicorns began their season with that aforementioned victory over LAKR in Dallas. Finn Allen led the way with 63 runs from 37 balls as they reached 166-4 in just 15.2 overs last week. In their second match of the tournament, they were skittled for just 127 by an experienced Texas Super Kings side before giving up the target in just 12.5 overs.\n\nLAST THREE: LWLLW\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nEven in victory, the Los Angeles Knight Riders simply haven’t scored enough runs. 162 shouldn’t have been enough to beat TSK and the two targets they have set since have been well below par. What did happen in their second game, though, was South African David Miller coming to the party with an unbeaten 44 at a strike rate of 200 and the thrilling middle-order bat is likely to be their top scorer if their misfiring top order get out early enough.\n\nWith the ball, they have a fair bit of variation with the likes of Ali Khan, Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan and Sunil Narine. However, they are heavily reliant on Aussie quick Spencer Johnson for wickets. The Unicorns go hard and should lose wickets so Johnson to take two or more poles would appear a good bet for that reason.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWith a top order that consists of the aforementioned Finn Allen as well as Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matt Short and Josh Inglis; the San Francisco Unicorns have the potential to do exactly what they have shown in their opening two matches; collapse in a heap or go hard and get a big score in no time. Short is the man in the best nick at the moment so him to score 30+ at another decent strike rate would be a worthy shout.\n\nIn the bowling department, the Unicorns have the experience of former England international Liam Plunkett but beyond that they are perhaps a bit blunt for the shortest format of the game with the consistently flattering to deceive Haris Rauf and more suited to Test match bowling of Abrar Ahmed. Plunkett remains their best chance of wickets outside of the powerplay so Plunkett to be their top bowler remains the best bet for this.\n\nLOS ANGELES KNIGHT RIDERS VS SAN FRANCISCO UNICORNS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nThis is a confusing one to predict a winner in because of the strengths and weakness of both sides. LAKR have the edge with the ball, whilst the Unicorns are certainly the more modern day and aggressive of the two sides with the bat. That said, if the top four of San Francisco, albeit Inglis dropped to five against TSK, can fire then they can easily overwhelm any team in the competition – and LAKR’s best bet, of experience with the ball, is still relatively weak. As a result, the Unicorns will be confident of doing the double over their opposition.",

    "body": "Washington Freedom beat Seattle Orcas by 5 wickets, in Match 8 of the Major League Cricket 2024, at Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas today.\n\nMatch Summary\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom, Match 8\n\nSeattle Orcas 124/10 (19.4 ov)\n\nWashington Freedom 127/5 (18.2 ov)\n\nResult - Washington Freedom won by 5 wickets\n\nSCORECARD\n\nManhattan\n\nMatch Analysis\n\nWashington Freedom edged out Seattle Orcas by five wickets in a tense low-scoring match of the 2024 Cognizant Major League Cricket at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas on Thursday.\n\nLockie Ferguson (4/26) and Saurabh Netravalkar (3/18) shared seven wickets to bundle out Seattle Orcas to 124 in 19.4 overs. Lahiru Milantha (33 off 30) and Obus Pienaar (25 off 28) then anchored a crucial unbeaten 63-run partnership to guide Washington Freedom past their 125-run target with 10 balls to spare.\n\nWith this win, Washington Freedom moved to the top of the points table with 5 points from three matches, remaining the only unbeaten team in the tournament thus far.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas came out firing to defend a low total of 125 runs. Imad Wasim removed the dangerous Travis Head for a duck on the second ball of the innings, ending the over with a wicket maiden. Steve Smith and Rachin Ravindra then looked to rebuild with the counter-attack. They scored as many as 18 runs in the third over. Ravindra looked dangerous with the bat, but Nandre Burger dismissed him in the fifth over for 26 off 16 balls, which included three boundaries and two sixes. Smith (12 off 13) followed him back to the pavilion in the following over, leaving the Orcas at 47/3 after six overs.\n\nBoth Mukhtar Ahmed and Glenn Maxwell were given lifelines with dropped catches but couldn't capitalise on them. Ahmed (8 off 8) was dismissed by Burger in the eighth over, and Maxwell (10 off 11) fell to Harmeet, leaving their team struggling at 68/5 after 10 overs.\n\nDespite the dire situation, Washington Freedom batters Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar showed resilience as they cautiously approached the target. They helped Washington reach the 100-run mark in the 16th over, reducing the equation to 23 runs needed off 24 balls. Milantha (33* off 30) and Pienaar (31* off 30) constructed a match-winning partnership to help their side get past the winning line.\n\nEarlier in the contest, the Seattle Orcas had a shaky start to their innings. Nauman Anwar was dismissed cheaply for 3 off 9 balls by Saurabh Netravalkar in the second over. The Seattle batters struggled to accelerate on the slow batting track, managing only 35 runs in the Powerplay. Ryan Rickelton also fell for 4 off 11 balls to Lockie Ferguson in the sixth over.\n\nQuinton de Kock (24 off 19) failed to build on his start and was bowled by Ferguson in the eighth over, with Seattle struggling at 44/3 after eight overs.\n\nHeinrich Klaasen and Shubham Ranjane carefully constructed a crucial partnership that steadied Seattle's innings. However, Ranjane (12 off 17) was unfortunately run out on the first ball of the 14th over. Klaasen, batting as if on a different surface, completed his fifty in just 29 balls but was immediately caught by Mukhtar Ahmed at long-off off Marco Jansen in the 15th over. His crucial innings, which included four fours and three sixes, helped Seattle cross the 100-run mark in the 15th over.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington bowlers didn't allow the following batters to score big. Ferguson took two wickets in the 17th over, finishing his spell with four wickets. He removed Imad Wasim (4 off 6) and Hammad Azam (4 off 9) in his last over.

The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the MI New York at Church Street Park in Morrisville. That game will be played on July 13th and will start at 12.30 am IST (7.00 pm GMT, the previous day). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nSteve Smith, the Washington Freedom skipper, says that it was a hard-fought game. Adds that the top order did not great start but Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar played smart cricket and got the job done. Shares that it was a slow and low wicket and all the bowlers did a good job. Mentions that they had a few hiccups with the bat but glad to be on the winning front. Reckons that the wicket got a tad slow so it was important to cash on the powerplay and would have been easy if someone from the top order had made a 50-60 but he's happy that the middle and lower order got their chance and they came out victorious.\n\nThe losing skipper of Seattle Orcas, Heinrich Klaasen says they lost the game in the last four overs with the bat as they couldn't add a lot to the total and left with a below-par score. Adds that they are lacking that one guy in the last few overs who could give them the perfect balance with both bat and ball to finish things well. Mentions that they needed to pick up wickets early on and they did that as well but they were good 15-20 runs shot at the end with the bat. Closes by saying the pitch was good and had they been at 140-145 by the end of their innings, the result could have been different.\n\nLockie Ferguson is the Player of the Match for his stellar spell. He says that it’s a good start to the campaign and nice to get in full 40 overs. Adds that as a group, it’s been great. Mentions that he tried bowling in good areas and it worked well for them. Ends by sharing that Heinrich Klaasen was looking dangerous and he's that they got his wicket.\n\nRachin Ravindra is up for a chat. He says it wasn't easy in the middle to bat but it was easier to bat while the ball was new. Adds that Imad Wasim bowled a maiden first up but him being a left-hander was a match-up for him and the support staff backed him for taking it on and it worked for him. Mentions that they look to stick to their plans and today despite the fall of wickets they kept playing their brand of cricket and eventually won.\n\nEarlier today, Seattle Orcas were asked to bat first and they made a below-par score of 124 with only Heinrich Klaasen making an attacking fifty while the rest of the batting struggled. Lockie Ferguson and Saurabh Netravalkar accounted for seven wickets between them and broke the back of Seattle Orcas' batting. Seattle Orcas are stranded at the bottom of the table while Washington Freedom moves to the top position. It's still early days in the season but teams will want to make winning a habit.\n\nSeattle Orcas did not have a huge score to defend but they started well by picking an early wicket. They gave away a few freebies through the powerplay but came back strong to put a dent in the Washington Freedom batting. Nandre Burger was the pick of the bowlers taking 2 for 26 while Harmeet Singh, Imad Wasim, and Cameron Gannon chipped in with one apiece and kept it tight. Seattle Orcas have suffered their second loss of the season and will want to turnaround their campaign quickly.\n\nA hard-fought run chase from the Washington Freedom takes them to the top of the table and they are unbeaten in the season so far. Chasing a tricky score of 125 for the win, the Freedom lost Travis Head for a duck but Smith and Ravindra stuck a few boundaries and got their side to a decent start in the powerplay. The Seattle Orcas came back strongly and reduced the Freedom to 64 for 5 with all their big guns back in the hut. Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar joined hands and added an unbeaten 63-run stand to steer their side home. Lahiru Milantha made a steady 33 off 30 while Obus Pienaar chipped in with 31 crucial runs. Washington Freedom are the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far and will hope to keep it going.\n\nStrategic Break! Washington Freedom needs 32 off the final five overs. They are ahead in the game but the Seattle Orcas are giving it a real fight. A couple of wickets here would tilt the tide in favor of the Orcas. Washington Freedom will hope for Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar to carry on and take their side home to get two more points on the board.",
    "summary": "The Washington Freedom cricket team has won their match against the Seattle Orcas, moving them to the top position in the tournament standings. The Freedom chasing a score of 125, made a hard-fought run to win the game with Lahiru Milantha and Obus Pienaar adding an unbeaten 63-run stand to steer their side home.

They bowled well to restrict LAKR to 165 runs total before Finn Allen went ballistic in the chase.\n\nHe scored 63 off 27 deliveries to ensure the Unicorns are off to a flyer start. Moreover, Matthew Short's fiery contribution of 58 (26) steered Unicorns to a successful run chase with four overs left.\n\nOverall, it was a complete performance from both the departments and hence ahead of the upcoming game against Texas, the Unicorns will count themselves as favourites.\n\nTexas Super Kings\n\nOn the other hand, Texas Super Kings are struggling to find their footing into the MLC 2024 edition. After losing a close game to LAKR in the tournament opener, Texas were saved by rain gods in the following game against Washington Freedom.\n\nSkipper Faf du Plessis' century resulted in 203 runs in the first innings total for Texas, and it appeared good enough until Travis Head and Steve Smith unleashed carnage in the powerplay.\n\nHead's 32 (12) and Smith's 26 (13) blistering knocks steered Washington to 64 runs on board in just the first four overs before rain interrupted play. Due to a weak drainage system, the game couldn't resume and both teams were awarded a point each.\n\nHowever, it's safe to say, had the game resumed, Washington would have walked all over Texas in no time. Hence, the Super Kings will remain under a lot of pressure against the Unicorns.\n\nSFU vs TEX: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSFU vs TEX: Church Street Park Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at Church Street Park generally provides a fair contest between bat and ball. However, this MLC 2024 season, the surface has favoured the batters to a larger extent. The powerplay period will be crucial for both sides and with the looming threat of rain, chasing is a good option.\n\nSFU vs TEX: Probable Playing XIs\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns: Jake Fraser-McGurk, Finn Allen, Josh Inglis (wk), Matthew Short, Corey Anderson (c), Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Brody Couch, Hassan Khan, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed\n\nTexas Super Kings: Devon Conway (wk), Faf du Plessis (c), Aaron Hardie, Joshua Tromp, Marcus Stoinis, Milind Kumar, Calvin Savage, Dwayne Bravo, Mohammad Mohsin, Naveen-ul-Haq, Zia-ul-Haq\n\nSFU vs TEX: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nSFU vs TEX: Winner Prediction\n\nConsidering the tournament's trend and condition evaluation, the San Francisco Unicorns are expected to beat the Texas Super Kings in the upcoming matchup.",

Hence, such instances need to be avoided by Seattle in the future.\n\nWashington Freedom is a formidable side and will ask the right questions. Hence, Heinrich Klaasen and Co must stay vigilant and step up as a unit to advance against Washington.\n\nWashington Freedom\n\nOn the other hand, Washington Freedom have been unlucky as their second game got washed out due to rain. Even in the tournament opener, they dodged a bullet with the results turning in their favour after the DLS method was enforced.\n\nChasing 155 runs against MI New York, Steve Smith stamped his authority with 46 off 28 runs knock, and before rain halted the game, Washington had 55 runs on board at the loss of one wicket. They were four runs ahead as per DLS calculations and were awarded two points for the game.\n\nWashington Freedom have potentially the most fierce and balanced unit at their helm this tournament. Travis Head and Smith are in the form of their lives whereas Glenn Maxwell, Marco Jansen and Saurabh Netravalkar have also raised the standards.\n\nHence, it's safe to say that Washington Freedom will be the team to beat this MLC 2024 edition.\n\nSEA vs WAS: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nSEA vs WAS: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at Grand Prairie Stadium has offered even assistance to both the batting and bowling departments. Bowlers who can maintain a good line and length and utilise the bounce effectively can trouble the batters. Spinners come into play as the pitch starts to wear down. Anything around 170-180 could be a match-winning total on the surface.\n\nSEA vs WAS: Probable Playing XIs\n\nSeattle Orcas: Quinton de Kock (wk), Ryan Rickelton, Heinrich Klaasen (c), Shubham Ranjane, Nauman Anwar, Imad Wasim, Hammad Azam, Harmeet Singh, Nandre Burger, Zaman Khan, Cameron Gannon\n\nWashington Freedom: Travis Head, Andries Gous (wk), Steven Smith (c), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed, Akeal Hosein, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Justin Dill, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nSEA vs WAS: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nSEA vs WAS: Winner Prediction\n\nConsidering the form and balance of both teams, this match is poised to be a close contest. Seattle Orcas will aim to find consistency, while Washington Freedom will be eager to maintain their winning streak. But overall, Freedom is likely to cross the finish line.",

    "body": "Preview\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders (LAS) will lock horns with San Francisco Unicorns (SF) in Match 10 of the Major League Cricket 2024, at Church Street Park, in Morrisville, on Sunday, July 14.\n\nKnight Riders currently find themselves in fourth position with just one win in three games. After winning their opening game over Texas Super Kings, the Sunil Narine-led side is on a two-match losing streak, suffering defeats against Unicorns and Seattle Orcas, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, Corey Anderson-led side is just below Knight Riders and holds the fifth position in the points table. The side started their campaign on a high note, registering a six-wicket win over the same opponents. But in their previous game against Super Kings, the San Francisco-based franchise faced a batting collapse which eventually resulted in them ending on the losing side.\n\nMatch Details\n\nPitch Report\n\nThe surface at Morrisville appears to be consistent, maintaining its characteristics for the full 20-over game. However, a notable issue is the decreasing strike rate of batters in the second innings, as the ball loses pace off the surface. This allows bowlers to exploit the inconsistent bounce, suggesting teams should set moderate, achievable targets rather than aiming for exceptionally high scores. However, the team that wins the toss will look to bowl first.\n\nHead-to-Head Record\n\nProbable Playing 11 for LAS vs SF, Match 10\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders\n\nJason Roy, Sunil Narine(C), Unmukt Chand (WK), Shakib Al Hasan, Nitish Kumar, David Miller, Andre Russell, Derone Davis, Corne Dry, Spencer Johnson, Ali Khan.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nFinn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Matthew Short, Josh Inglis(WK), Corey Anderson(C), Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Hassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam Plunkett, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nAlso Check:\n\nProbable Top Performers from LAS vs SF\n\nProbable Best Batter of the match:\n\nJason Roy could be the best batter in the upcoming match against the San Francisco-based franchise. The English opener who is not a regular member of the Three Lions has been featuring in most of the franchise-based leagues all around the world. For San Francisco, Roy has been exceptional with his bat and has scored 97 runs in three innings. With his form, he can trouble the opposition bowlers and take his team to a comfortable position single-handedly.\n\nProbable Best Bowler of the match:\n\nSpencer Johnson could be the best bowler in the forthcoming game. The left-arm pacer has been among the wickets since the first game and is currently the second-highest wicket-taker with six wickets under his name. With the pitch favouring more to the bowlers, Johnson will be a key player.\n\nToday’s Match Prediction: The team that bowls first to win the match\n\nScenario 1\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 40-50\n\nFirst Innings Score: 140-150\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders win the match\n\nScenario 2\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns win the toss and opt to bowl\n\nPowerplay: 30-40\n\nFirst Innings Score: 130-140\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns win the match",

However, their efforts were overshadowed by a stellar performance from the Seattle Orcas, who chased down the target with ease, finishing at 169/1 in just 19.5 overs. This commanding display led to a resounding 9-wicket victory for the Orcas.\n\nRyan Rickelton played a pivotal role in Seattle’s triumph with an unbeaten 103 off 66 balls, showcasing his exceptional batting prowess. His innings included a mix of elegant strokes and powerful hitting, steering his team towards victory. Supporting him was Quinton de Kock, the wicketkeeper, who contributed a steady 51 not out off 46 deliveries, ensuring a strong partnership that sealed the game early for the Orcas. Nauman Anwar added a quickfire 9 runs from 7 balls, adding to the team’s total with valuable contributions down the order.\n\nOn the bowling front, Zaman Khan was instrumental for the Orcas, delivering an impressive spell to claim 2 wickets for just 24 runs in his 4 overs. His ability to strike crucial blows halted the Knight Riders’ momentum during their innings. Harmeet Singh also made significant contributions with the ball, taking 2 wickets for 34 runs in his allotted 4 overs, tightening the grip on Los Angeles’ batting lineup. Cameron Gannon chipped in with a crucial wicket, conceding 26 runs in his 4 overs, further bolstering the Orcas’ dominant performance.\n\nIn contrast, Match 5 saw the Washington Freedom making a strong start, reaching 62/0 in just 4 overs against the Texas Super Kings before rain interrupted play, leading to the match being abandoned. Travis Head was in exceptional form, smashing 32 runs off only 12 balls with aggressive strokeplay, setting a blistering pace early on. Captain Steven Smith provided steady support with 26 runs from 13 deliveries, ensuring Washington’s brisk start before weather conditions intervened.\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar proved effective with the ball for the Texas Super Kings, picking up 2 crucial wickets for 33 runs in his 4 overs. His ability to break partnerships and control the run rate was crucial in restricting the Freedom’s scoring rate.

    "body": "In a league match between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings in the 2024 Major League Cricket tournament, Mitchell Santner delivered a match-winning performance, punctuated by a monstrous 106-metre six that sealed the victory for his team.\n\nThe match, played at the Church Street Park in Morrisville, saw the Texas Super Kings chasing a challenging target of 128 runs set by the San Francisco Unicorns. With the game hanging in the favour of Texas, Santner stepped up to the crease in the 12th over, with his team needing 10 runs off 8.1 overs to secure the win.\n\nMitchell Santer, the baby-faced assassin\n\nAs the tension mounted, Santner faced a delivery from San Francisco’s Hassan Khan. What followed was a moment of sheer brilliance. Santner got under the tossed-up delivery outside off stump and unleashed a monstrous shot that sailed high and long, clearing the boundary by a considerable margin. The ball travelled an astonishing 106 metres, leaving the crowd in awe and the San Francisco fielders in disbelief.\n\n“That six from Santner was an absolute beast,” commented one of the commentators. “He just got under that delivery and sent it into the stratosphere. That’s the kind of shot that can turn a game on its head.”\n\nThe mammoth six brought the Texas Super Kings within touching distance of victory, with only 4 runs needed off the 8 overs remaining. Santner and his partner Milind Kumar made light work of the remaining runs, sealing a 7-wicket victory for their team.\n\nHere’s the video\n\nSkipper’s appreciation after the match\n\n“Santner’s six was the turning point of the match,” said the Texas Super Kings captain, Faf du Plessis. Faf also added in the post-match presentation that the experienced all-rounder is an asset to his team, and he expects the same from him every time he comes out on the ground.\n\nAlso WATCH: Quinton de Kock’s eye-catching reverse scoop shots during LAKR vs SEO game in MLC 2024\n\nHe stated, “It took the wind out of the Unicorns’ sails and gave us the momentum we needed to finish the job. That’s the kind of match-winning contribution we expect from our experienced players.”\n\nThe one-sided affair between the San Francisco Unicorns and the Texas Super Kings once again showcased the Santner being an asset in T20 cricket, where the all-rounder’s brilliance with both bat and ball can turn the tide of the game. Santner’s monstrous six will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the highlights of the 2024 Major League Cricket season.",

    "body": "Our Major League Cricket 2024 campaign starts with a mouth-watering clash against defending champions MI New York at Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina, on July 6.\n\nSteve Smith joins our side with a host of exciting players this season and will lead us in the second edition of MLC. Along with Smith, the Australian duo of Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell are also on board and will strengthen our batting.\n\nTravis Head had an excellent outing in the T20 World Cup 2024, finishing as the highest run-getter for Australia and the third-highest overall. The Southpaw amassed 255 runs from seven matches at an excellent average of 42.50 and a strike rate of 158.38.\n\nNew Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra and pacer Lockie Ferguson also join the team, alongside home favorites Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar who held fort from last year.\n\nGous and Netravalkar finished as the highest run-getter and wicket-taker respectively for the USA in the recently concluded T20 World Cup, powering the co-host to the Super 8 stage in their first-ever World Cup.\n\nRicky Ponting will be our Head Coach for the MLC 2024 season as he takes over the reins from last year’s coach Greg Shipperd. Ponting will be assisted by former Australian batter Cameron White.\n\nWhat went down for Washington Freedom in MLC 2023?\n\nWe finished third in the MLC 2023 standings with six points from three wins and two losses in our group games. In the resulting Eliminator contest against MI New York, we fell short by 16 runs.\n\nMatthew Short was our top run-getter in the 2023 campaign with 152 runs from six outings. Saurabh Netravalkar topped our bowling charts, ranking fifth overall with 10 wickets from six matches, including breathtaking figures of 6/9 against the San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nMLC 2024 Schedule: Washington Freedom matches\n\nUnlike the five league matches, one against each team, which all teams had in MLC 2023, the current edition will see teams play a total of seven league matches. We will face MI New York and Texas Super Kings twice each and play once against the remaining three teams. Here's a look at our schedule for MLC 2024.\n\nWashington Freedom Matches at MLC 2024\n\nMLC 2024: Washington Freedom squad\n\nOur team has progressed well from last year and grown into a stronger unit in the second season. The batting group has a wealth of experience, especially with the Australian trio of Head, Maxwell, and Smith.\n\nMukhtar Ahmed is a dangerous batter at the top of the order, averaging 28.77 in T20s with a healthy strike rate of 146.18.\n\nLahiru Milantha is the second wicketkeeper in the squad, along with Andries Gous. The left-handed Milantha is also a useful batter, averaging just under 25 with a strike rate of 136.58.\n\nGlenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, Marco Jansen, and Ian Holland are the all-rounders who provide the much-needed balance to the side. Holland averages 27.55 with the bat in T20s, and his handy medium pace provides a breakthrough every 22.6 balls.\n\nNetravalkar and Ferguson spearhead a pace attack that includes the experienced Andrew Tye. Tye has a tally of 332 wickets from 239 matches at an average of 21.15 and an unbelievable strike rate of 15.4.\n\nAkeal Hosein will headline the spin department. He will be the fourth left-arm spinner in the side, along with Ravindra, Obus Pienaar, and Amila Aponso.\n\nWashington Freedom Squad: Steven Smith (c), Akhilesh Reddy Bodugum, Jack Edwards, Andries Gous, Travis Head, Lahiru Milantha, Mukhtar Ahmed, Justin Dill, Ian Holland, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Rachin Ravindra, Amila Aponso, Lockie Ferguson, Akeal Hosein, Saurabh Netravalkar, Andrew Tye, Yasir Mohammad\n\nWhere to watch WF vs MINY MLC 2024 LIVE\n\nThe LIVE telecast and streaming of the Washington Freedom vs MI New York match will be available on Monumental Sports Network in Washington D.C. and Willow by Cricbuzz in the USA.

SO skipper Heinrich Klaasen top-scored in the contest with 51 off 30 balls.\n\nIn response, Lahiru Milantha played a sensible innings to anchor our chase with an unbeaten 30-ball 33, as we reached 127/5 with more than an over remaining. Obus Pienaar also chipped in with an unbeaten 31 off 30 balls.\n\nNetravalkar justified skipper Steve Smith’s decision to bowl first by striking in his first over. Ferguson picked up a wicket in the powerplay, as SO managed 35/2 after the first six overs, with only 16 runs coming from boundaries.\n\nWe kept things tight even after the powerplay with Ferguson knocking Quinton de Kock for his second wicket of the match. Smith was in action as he ran out Shubham Ranjane with an excellent fielding effort to break a crucial partnership.\n\nMarco Jansen dismissed dangerman Heinrich Klaasen, who had just reached his half-century and looked in fine touch. Ferguson returned for a double strike in his final over to end his spell with four scalps and Seattle Orcas were all-out with two balls to spare.\n\nNetravalkar rose to the top of the bowling charts of MLC 2024, picking up his eighth wicket of the tournament. The left-arm pacer finished with an incisive spell of 3/18.\n\nChasing 125, Rachin Ravindra, playing his first match in the MLC, got us off to a quick start, hitting 26 off just 16 balls, which included two sixes and three fours. We reached 47 for the loss of three wickets at the end of the powerplay.\n\nFrom 64/5, Milantha and Pienaar put their heads down to build a crucial partnership to wrest the initiative back from SO. Their unbroken sixth-wicket partnership of 63 runs from 55 balls helped us cross the line as we remained the only team to be unbeaten in the MLC this year.\n\nWith the win, we moved to the top of the MLC 2024 points table with five points from three matches.\n\nWe will meet the Los Angeles Knight Riders in our next match at Church Street Park in Morrisville on Sunday.\n\nSeattle Orcas vs Washington Freedom MLC 2024 brief scores: SO 124 in 19.4 overs (Heinrich Klaasen 51, Quinton de Kock 24, Lockie Ferguson 4/26, Saurabh Netravalkar 3/18) vs WF 127/5 in 18.2 overs (Lahiru Milantha 33*, Obus Pienaar 31*, Nandre Burger 2/27, Harmeet Singh 1/15)\n\nWashington Freedom won by five wickets.",

    "title": "San Francisco Unicorns star Corey Anderson details growing cricket in US",
    "date": "Mon Jul 22 17:22:59 2024",
    "body": "Programming note: The San Francisco Unicorns-Washington Freedom match airs Monday at 5:30 p.m. PT on NBC Sports Bay Area Plus.\n\nCricket is one of the most popular global sports, but in the US, it is just starting to gain national attention.\n\nThe recently completed T20 World Cup featured matches in Texas, New York and Florida, and Major League Cricket -- with the San Francisco Unicorns as one of its inaugural six teams -- is about to wrap up its second season.\n\nAll-rounder Corey Anderson is at the center of both events.\n\nThe 33-year-old New Zealand native moved to the US in 2020 and joined Team USA to help spearhead the growth of cricket in the country.\n\nAnderson, the Unicorns' captain, helped Team USA stun Pakistan in World Cup group play in one of the biggest upsets in all of sports in recent memory.\n\nNow Anderson and the Unicorns (four wins, one loss, one no-result) are vying to win the Major League Cricket championship. They finish their regular-season schedule against the Washington Freedom on Monday night.\n\nNews\n\nThe Unicorns and Freedom will meet again Thursday in the MLC Qualifier. The winner advances to the Final.\n\nMI New York and the Texas Super Kings meet in the Eliminator match. The loser is done, but the winner advances to the Challenger, where they will take on the loser of the Unicorns-Freedom Qualifier.\n\nThe winner of the challenger heads to the Final, which takes place Sunday in Grand Prairie, Texas -- the venue for a majority of MLC's matches. Others are being played in Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\nSo there is a real chance the Unicorns and Freedom could play three consecutive times in a six-day span.\n\nAhead of the Unicorns' match on Monday, Anderson spoke with NBC Sports Bay Area about his journey to the US, growing the sport in the country, his experience in the World Cup, the Unicorns signing Australian National Team captain Pat Cummins and cricket returning to the Olympics in 2028.\n\n[Editor's note: This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity]\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area: “You're a native New Zealander. You spent about eight years representing that country, but you retired from that team back in 2020. And you moved here. And you now represent the U.S. Give new fans of cricket a brief overview of your professional career and what went into your decision to leave New Zealand and come to the U.S.”\n\nCorey Anderson: “I played for New Zealand, as you said, for give-or-take about eight years and a few injuries through then, so it was probably a little bit off and on. But yeah, played in multiple World Cups with New Zealand and it was the dream when I was a kid to play for the Black Caps and then in COVID 2020. I came across to the States and my wife is from Dallas, so that was the big reason for moving across. And saw an opportunity with the major league and thought, ‘Everyone's always been wanting America to grow with cricket and it's always been something that everyone's been really intrigued with.’ And I thought, ‘What better than getting in there on the ground level and trying to help this thing grow?’\n\n“I've been here for a period of time now and I mean, it's been great. To play for the US in the World Cup was unbelievable and extremely exciting. I didn't think my career would quite take that path or that journey. But it's exciting.”\n\nNBCSBA: “When did the possibility of playing for Major League Cricket first pop up for you and what about that appealed to you?”\n\nAnderson: “I think having a new competition – there’s so many of them jumping up. But like I said before, I think America being a pretty untapped market in terms of cricket. It just had so much interest to it. And I've always loved the States and I love American sports, and I think there was just something about it that kind of attracted me to it and I think it was an opportunity that was too hard to pass up on.\n\n“Just the growth and being able to kind of try and get your fingerprints on a new sport in America and help it grow, I think was the most exciting part. So that said, a lot of hoops to jump through and a lot of hurdles to get over. But yeah, it's getting there.”\n\nNBCSBA: “What has your experience been like so far in the first two years of actual gameplay for Major League cricket?\n\nAnderson: “It's been fantastic. We're really lucky here that the grounds that we do have are at a really high quality and the overseas players that we have bought across, as well as some of the best in the world, some of the best that are going around the T20 circuit. In terms of a fan of the game, being able to watch that and get eyes on, again, the biggest players in the world. Pretty cool to have that at your own back doorstep.\n\n“It's taken a heap attraction and there's been so many eyes on it. It's very early in the journey for it, but yeah, being the second season now, it's gone up and up and up and you know, hopefully, it continues on that trend.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Do you expect in future seasons, the seasons, to get longer as you guys gain more traction?”\n\nAnderson: “Yeah, I would imagine so. I don't think to a to a huge degree. I think scheduling around other competitions is still something that's a continual work on for every competition. But yeah, I could see this progressing out to playing a home and away game, you know, 10 games in a season, then the playoffs. But again, that's probably the infrastructure part is the big issue.\n\n“That's an ongoing thing. That's probably the biggest piece to the puzzle that needs to get sorted. And that stuff takes time to get through city planning and trying to find land for that. Unfortunately, cricket's not the makeshift baseball stadium or football stadium. So we can’t kind of just move it to one place and pack it up in the next.\n\n“So you've got to basically grow these things from the ground up or renovate existing stadiums. They can have the room to do it. There's a lot more moving pieces to try and grow that. But it has started in a lot of other places in the home. Places like San Francisco as well have started those conversations and trying to start those contracts and the construction of those stadiums.”\n\nNBCSBA: “I believe I've heard that Santa Clara County is trying to get a stadium or they're trying to build a stadium in Santa Clara County just south of San Francisco. Have you been to San Francisco? Have you been to the Bay Area? What do you know about the Bay Area?”\n\nAnderson: “I don't know the Bay Area really well, but I've been there a few times now. We normally have a little bit of a preseason when we go in and I think we've been great in terms of trying to have fan activation and try to grow the brand itself as well. And I think we're probably one of the only times that's actually doing that and getting out to say our hands [are] dirty into the environment and try and actually get our fan base and grow it so when we do have a stadium that we can play it in the home ground, we've got a fan base that will happily turn up and make sure that we can fill out a stadium. I think we've done a great job toward that. And I know that the marketing group on the staff at the uniforms have done a tremendous job.”\n\nNBCSBA: \"You have played in the [Indian Premier League] and you've played in the Big Bash [in Australia]. Those are established leagues around the world. How far is Major League Cricket from reaching that level and what needs to be done to get there?”\n\nAnderson: “The IPL is probably the pinnacle of all sports in terms cricket for the franchises, but Major League [Cricket has] got the potential to compete with it.\n\n“I think if you look at the broadcasting landscape in America, it's one of the biggest sports broadcasting countries in the world. And again, it's just been so untapped and underdeveloped, particularly with cricket here in this country. If we can grow it on that level and attract, I guess, more Americans to watch the game and get involved with it, that's more of a long-term play.\n\n“But it has such a big upside to it. And I think that's why people have been so excited about it, is it's just got so much room to grow. And considering cricket's second biggest pool in the world and I know it's very much dominated by the South Asian culture, but there's no reason why Americans can't love it and get around it and make it their own as well, right?”\n\nNBCSBA: “Is the key to success for cricket and Major League Cricket in the US appealing to people that already follow cricket in this country? Or is it appealing to new fans who don't know much about cricket and getting them to understand and buy into the sport?”\n\nAnderson: “I think it's a combination. That it's trying to find a happy medium, I guess pleasing the masses of the ones who already are the diehard cricket lovers. And so we're going to turn up to the games and I think obviously we always appreciate the support, but I think trying to grow this into America is trying to grab that local fan base and say, ‘Hey, this is a new game. It's an exciting game. If you're intrigued by it, come down, watch it, learn it.’ And I think over the last couple of months as well, especially with the [T20] World Cup, there was a lot of coverage around that and a lot of people, a lot of media outlets who normally don't discuss cricket started talking about cricket, which is fantastic for the game in general.\n\n“But again, there's the thirst for it and we just need to make sure we can kind of keep applying that when we can. And yeah, I think it's got so much room to grow. It's exciting. It's an exciting time to be involved in cricket in America.\n\nNBCSBA: “You were part of the Team USA win over Pakistan [in the T20 World Cup], which was a massive upset. I was in New York at the time and I got alerts from national media, American media, that normally don't send alerts about cricket. But that was a big, big deal. That was talked about everywhere. What was it like being part of that and just that kind of an upset?”\n\nAnderson: “It's pretty surreal. I mean, USA Cricket in terms of I guess our fan base itself is we're kind of basically unknown to a degree. I think a lot of Americans didn't realize we even had a cricket team. So we were obviously massive underdogs in terms of trying to go up against these big nations. And I think the beauty of it as well as I've been on the other side of it, where I've played for one of the top eight nations in the world, and you're always a chance at winning and you're always trying to strike winning that trophy.\n\n“And I think being on the other side now, it's funny because I know that can scare teams when you're a little team because you can ruin someone's day and ruin someone's World Cup. I think the outlook we had was, yes, we were underdogs, but let's lean into that and kind of create a little bit of carnage.\n\n“And if we can catch people on the hop a little bit and have them vulnerable and we end up having a good day, then I know we've got the talent to be able to do it. And I think we saw that against Pakistan. You tend to find against those big teams, the big teams might crumble and just have a really bad day and they end up losing the game instead of the other team winning.\n\n“But I think in that regard, when we played Pakistan, we genuinely beat them. We actually won. We played really good cricket from Ball One all the way through. Ideally, it wouldn't have gone [to a] Super Over. We probably dragged that out a little bit too much, but we still did the job and I think for 95 percent of that game we were in control.\n\n“And I think that shows people the talent that we do have that we can compete against some of the biggest players in the world. And that was a huge confidence booster, not only for the guys themselves, but I think just the landscape of cricket in America to understand that yes, we can compete and we can perform against these big teams and it shows people that there is the hype that's been drawn in the last two or three years around Major League Cricket and trying to grow it kind of gives a bit of an answer to say this is why these things are in place and this is where we can get to and this is why we need to continue to play high levels of cricket against the best teams in the world. Because we can compete, we can get better, and the only way is up. The sky's the limit in where we can actually go to. And I know there's a lot of local talent, a lot of young kids who are really good at cricket, but unfortunately there's never really been a pathway for them to continue playing the game.\n\n“So with Major League Cricket and Minor League Cricket, we can now say to the younger generation, there's a career for you here if you want it, and if you want to keep pursuing it and you love this game, it's all in front of you. And I think now that's a good time to get into cricket because it's just going to get bigger and bigger.\"\n\nNBCSBA: “It sets the stage for future World Cups, for Team USA in future World Cups. But also Cricket is returning to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles. Do you hope to play for Team USA in four years and how do you see that stage helping cricket grow in the US?\"\n\nAnderson: “I think in four more years’ time, it’s hard to know what's going to happen in four years' time. I moved here four years ago and a lot's happened in that space of time. So, look, I think that I'm extremely excited to be able to potentially have the opportunity to be involved in another World Cup and also an Olympics. I think the great thing as well is that USA cricket's generally never had more than kind of 12 months in front of them where they could plan and they know what they're doing and schedule and things like that.\n\n“We've now got a four-year cycle here where in two years’ time there's another T20 World Cup to try and prepare for. Post that another two years after that there is an Olympics and it's on our shores. And I think that's just such an exciting prospect to say not only to the cricketers themselves, but to sponsors anyone who wants to get involved with USA cricket is a four-year cycle here, which is a huge time to get involved. And the upside is massive, obviously, because you're now on the biggest stage and we've shown that we can compete on the biggest stage.\n\n“And again, the USA always has this wonderful thing of any time they plan an event, regardless of what sport it is or what league it is, eyes are always tuned to the US because again, that one of the most powerful countries in the world and in terms of sport, they love sports and I think they love an underdog and they love a winner.\n\n“And I think when we started taking the blocks on both of those during the World Cup, we obviously didn't win it entirely. But I think we probably arguably won people's hearts over during that process. And I think that kind of goes a long way to it as well.”\n\nNBCSBA: “You definitely got people's attention in this country. I had coworkers who don't watch cricket who saw that and were like, ‘Were you there for that match? I'm like, “No, I was in New York, not in Dallas,’ but that's the attention that kind of upset got. It was people that don't normally watch it are talking about it. So that's kind of the goal, right? Is to win the matches and get people's attention.\"\n\nAnderson: “And that's the thing. And there's going to be so many different ways to try and attract people to the game. It can't always just be the one side, but it's got to be so, so many different angles and so many different ways to try and get people to get involved in this game and understand it and learn it and love it. And that's just one of those places I think everyone loves when they're in love, loves a story and a narrative behind that and I think we've created that and we just need to continue to keep growing that as well.\n\n“And it's exciting for people to kind of know that they got an early on the journey and can see it start to flourish and see where it gets to over a period of time. We will also take bandwagon fans as well if we get to a point of that as well. But I think it's just exciting to obviously be involved with it and get to the point where we're at the moment.\n\n“I think the guys have made such huge sacrifices to be here and I think that probably gets missed a little bit. I know a lot of the guys aren’t originally born in the US and have got very different stories around how they got here. And I’ve heard multiple times just through other sources in terms media that it a bit of an artificial team. I think the guys take offense to that in a way because we’ve sacrificed a lot to be in this situation and moving countries and uprooting your life is not easy. And the guys worked very, very hard to get where they are. I know when we put on the USA jersey, we’re extremely proud to play for it.\n\n“And I think that was the big thing we discussed during the World Cup. Yes, we’re not the favorite. We’re not expected to win. We’re not even expected to through to the top eight. But if we lose every game, results are results and you can’t really do anything about the outcome. But we wanted to make sure we made USA proud of the cricket team and there’s so many ways you can do that, whether its chasing a ball to boundary, keep fighting to the very end regardless of how it looks. And I think we did that for the majority of the tournament and that’s what people loved the most about it. I think our attitude towards our, I guess, our moral compass of why and how we’re playing for the US is fantastic. Hopefully we can just shepherd the next generation into that USA team and continue to grow.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Has there been any talk of like Team USA doing tours of [countries] like India or Pakistan or Australia, New Zealand or South Africa or any of the big eight countries?\n\nAnderson: “I think I think that's something that the ICC is always going to have to be the one who does the scheduling and figure out those future tours. But I think again, there’s a need and a want. We obviously would love to do it because it increases the value of what we are doing and the talent that we have that’ll keep producing cricketers here and being able to know that they can play against these players. But I think sometimes it doesn't always match up with those schedulings..\n\n“And I know that teams would love to come across to the States and again, in time, I think when we have more infrastructure that's going to be more and more feasible. But yeah, I think if it's teams wanting to do almost like a mini-tour before they go to another nation, like a warm-up series or something like that, I think at that moment where we're not going to be extremely picky around who wants to do it, they come to our shores and I think that's the exciting thing.\n\n“I think they know now that when they play the USA, we can compete and they can get some really good cricket and be tested as well. So that probably hasn't happened in the past. So that's probably changed the narrative around who we can potentially play in and when we potentially play them. So that's extremely exciting.”\n\nNBCSBA: “[The Unicorns] recently added Australian National Team captain Pat Cummins. What has it been like having him on somebody of his stature on the roster?”\n\nAnderson: “It's huge. I mean, any time you bring in one of the best players in the world, it's going to lift the team and they're going to be extremely excited to play alongside him. And [I’ve been] lucky enough to play with Pat a handful of times during the IPL and he's a great human being as well.\n\n“Sometimes the biggest players in the world, sometimes it goes the other way when they get into a changing room. But the amount of knowledge that [he] has and what he's willing to give to guys, to help them. I think he's also saying this is an opportunity to help grow the game and it's an exciting prospect.\n\n“And kudos to him as well. He’s had hardly any time over the last six months, basically, and for him to want to be involved with the Unicorns is huge. It's not only for the players to be able to have him involved and the fans, but just the marketing aspect of having Pat involved in groups.\n\n“I know he's helped me tremendously in terms of captaining the side, calling on him to be a bit of a sounding board when I'm out there in the middle as well. It's been so valuable. He's a great guy to have in the group and I'm glad he's here long-term as well.\"\n\nNBCSBA: “I know he signed a four-year contract so … he made a sizable commitment to playing in Major League Cricket, playing for the Unicorns like that. That has to feel good that somebody of his stature is willing to make that kind of commitment. [He’s going to] come here every year for the next couple of years, right?\"\n\nAnderson: “Massively. I think it's smart for his side. And I think smart from the Unicorn side as well. I think you want to you want to get the best players in the world and you want to try and have as long as you possibly can. So yeah, I think that's a win-win for both camps and I know I'm extremely excited to have him in the group for a lot longer.\n\n“Hopefully we can continue to have a similar group going forward as well. I know franchise cricket tends to change very quickly and scheduling and availability always seems to be an issue that comes up. But the group at the moment is fantastic and I know we're winning and it makes things a little bit easier as well.\n\n“But regardless of that, that's been a great group to be around. And yeah, hopefully, we can kind of stick together and keep continuing to grow our culture as well.”\n\nNBCSBA: “Pat was quoted in a story recently that he said your presence, along with Coach Shane Watson, played a part in his decision to play in Major League Cricket. What does it mean to you to have that kind of impact on your peers?”\n\nAnderson: “Yes, that's great. I think you can try and get guys who enjoy playing alongside you or things like that. That's obviously such a big, big one in terms of feeling proud about what you're doing. But again, I think when you look at cricket as a whole and you look at the guys that you play alongside when you're out there in the field and your batting and bowling and fielding that, that's obviously from what people see is a big part of the game.\n\n“Obviously it's how you win games and it's how you go about your stuff. But I think the human element of it being off the field and understanding that when you've got a team that you get along with and guys gel well together, you can go and have a drink question or a coffee or whatever it might be, that makes such a huge difference in the performance part as well.\n\n“Like I said before, Pat's just a great human being and there's probably not so many better guys to have involved in this group. It's extremely exciting to have him and it's nice of him to say those kind words.”\n\nNBCSBA: “You guys play Washington [on Monday] and then you play them again in a Qualifier. You could potentially play them a third straight time in the [Major League Cricket] Final. How do you see your squad matching up with Washington? And then when you're preparing for a match like that and you know you're going to see them again potentially two more times, do you potentially hold anything back in [Monday’s] match so that you don't give them anything to look out for the following matches or do you play it straight up?”\n\nAnderson: “Good question. I mean, it's probably a little bit more of a unique situation because, like you said, yeah, we could be looking at playing them three times in a row. That's in a perfect world. That would be nice if that's the case, because it would mean we’re through to the Final. But that being said, yeah, tonight's an interesting one.\n\n“We've had a few niggles in the camp regarding some injuries and things like that, so we've just got to be cautious. Obviously moving forward. It's always nice to know that you're already in that 1 and 2 spot and playing in the Finals with another life. But I think momentum and cricket's such a massive thing and I think most sports would probably say the same thing that you want to get your straps and you kind of want to keep going and when things are thinking, you get yourself in those situations, more than not, you start understanding how you need to win and it'll change from game to game.\n\n“But I don't think you want to take the foot off the throat or foot off the gas. I think, yeah, you still got to put your best foot forward and try and play the best cricket you can. And yeah, there might be some tactics around something slightly different. But again, I think the talent that we've got on our side is it's obviously extremely exciting. “And hopefully tonight, [it] goes similar way to what has been as well and guys can do their job and we can still get a win. Yeah nice to know we're through the Finals. Still got work to do.\"",

They come into this final match having lost each of their last four, most recently going down by six wickets to San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nLAST THREE: LLL\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nIt’s key to wait until the respective line-ups are announced before making any investments here. As this match has nothing at stake, both teams, particularly Texas Super Kings with a crunch eliminator on the horizon could choose to give their key players a rest. Captain Faf du Plessis should play though and remains top of the run-scoring table in Major League Cricket this season with 264 runs to his name so far. Back him to accumulate another 20+ runs here.\n\nMarcus Stoinis’ big-hitting exploits are not to be ignored as his brute power makes him a prime candidate for investment via the relevant betting markets available. Explore backing the Australian all-rounder to strike the most sixes across this encounter for Texas Super Kings.\n\nSEATTLE ORCAS BETTING ANALYSIS\n\nWe mentioned Faf du Plessis and his position at the top of the run-scoring charts. Trailing just behind him is Ryan Rickelton, with 225 runs under his belt, including a top score of 103 not out. His personal ambition would likely be to try and overhaul his fellow South African, so backing him to score a fifty in this match may prove a smart move.\n\nWe’ve touched upon the bowling skills of domestic player Harmeet Singh previously and it’s these USA stars who arguably have the most to prove as we edge towards the latter end of this tournament. Harmeet no doubt wants to show that he is worthy of franchise gigs in other competitions down the line by adding to his eight wickets gained across this tournament. Back Harmeet to finish as Seattle’s top bowler here.\n\nTEXAS SUPER KINGS VS SEATTLE ORCAS EXPERT PREDICTION\n\nAs much as the Seattle Orcas management will want a win over the Super Kings to end their tournament, the reality is that most of their squad are likely to have their minds elsewhere at this point, specifically on their next cricketing assignment whether it be a franchise gig or international commitments.\n\nMotivation is higher for Texas Super Kings, knowing that two straight losses going into the play-offs would not bode well for them. Add that to home advantage being in their favour and the expectation is that Texas will gain the victory, even if they were to rotate their team.",

The next match of the competition will see the Texas Super Kings locking horns with the Seattle Orcas in Match 21 at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, Texas. It will be another dead rubber as the four teams for the playoffs are already locked in. That game will be played on July 24th and will start at 6.00 am IST (12.30 am GMT). But as you know, you can always join early for all the build-up. Until then, take care, and cheers!\n\nThe skipper of San Francisco Unicorns, Corey Anderson is up for a chat. He says that they had seen glimpses of Sanjay Krishnamurthi before and he feels proud of how Sanjay performed today. Adds that he is only 20 and he has got such maturity. Says that he will be a big player for them in their following games. Mentions that Hassan Khan is a key player for them as well and ends by saying that they can rely on him at any part of their innings.\n\nSteve Smith, the Washington Freedom skipper says that they played nicely and had a good score on board. Adds that it was a reasonable chase and the Unicorns batted well. Shares that they wanted to take the game on Travis Head has been exceptional. Mentions that today he got off to a fast start and Travis Head played as a second fiddle. Ends by lauding the Unicorn batters sharing that it got challenging with the wet outfield but plenty to learn in the rain-reduced game.\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his sensational knock. He says that he decided to go hard from the beginning. Adds that he wanted to take his chances and it came off today. Shares that he worked on the mental side, and that helped him to play freely. Mentions that it was not turning much for the left-arm spinners, so he was trying to keep a calm head in the middle and it paid off.\n\nJosh Inglis is in for a chat.

Adds that this will give them confidence in the qualifiers and this win was needed.

Both Travis Head and Steven Smith scored outstanding fifties while Andries Gous and Rachin Ravindra played handy cameos. Corey Anderson and Hassan Khan were the pick of the bowlers for the Unicorns on a run fest day in Dallas. This win gets the San Francisco Unicorns on par with the Washington Freedom on the points table but they will finish second as the Freedom have a superior net run rate.\n\nWashington Freedom started well with the ball but failed to keep it tight through the middle and the latter over. Akeal Hosein got the early wicket of Finn Allen while Andrew Tye got three for 41. All the bowlers, except Rachin Ravindra went for over 12 runs to the over and it was absolute carnage. Washington Freedom did rest quite a few of their first-choice bowlers but wouldn't have thought to lose after setting a huge score. They will want to take the learnings from this game before they meet the Unicorns again in Qualifer 1.\n\nAn extraordinary run chase from the San Francisco Unicorns sees them defeat the Washington Freedom by 6 wickets with just 2 balls to spare. The Unicorns needed 177 to win off the 14 overs as per the DLS Method and they have done it in some style. Chasing the score, the openers departed early but Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Josh Inglis smoked it all around the park and added 77 runs in just 5 overs. Inglis made a quick-fire 45 off 17 while Hassan Khan chipped in with an unbeaten cameo of 32 off 11. The star of the chase was Sanjay Krishnamurthi who made a brilliant 79 off just 42 and took his team over the line. With this win, San Francisco Unicorns become the first side to defeat the Washington Freedom this season.\n\n4\n\nOvers12.6\n\nScore174 - 4\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar to Hassan Khan, FOUR! Make that three in a row! Full toss, outside off. Hassan Khan swings hard again and gets another outside edge that runs to the deep third region for a hat-trick of boundaries.

Sanjay Krishnamurthi picks it early and hammers it over the deep square leg boundary for half a dozen. Sanjay Krishnamurthi is playing a gem of a knock here. The equation is now 23 off 13 balls.\n\nW\n\nOvers9.6\n\nScore122 - 4\n\nAndrew Tye to Sherfane Rutherford, OUT! STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR AND TAKEN! Tye gets two in the over! Goes short of a length, around off. Sherfane Rutherford miscues the pull and goes straight up in the air. Andrew Tye goes to his right and takes a good catch off his bowling. Sherfane Rutherford departs for a second ball duck. San Francisco Unicorns are four down.\n\nW\n\nOvers9.4\n\nScore122 - 3\n\nAndrew Tye to Josh Inglis, OUT! CAUGHT! Josh Inglis is gone!

As a result, he was chosen for the Karnataka State Cricket Association U-16 team.\n\n#4 He came back to Houston in 2020\n\nSanjay came to Houston at the start of 2020 to participate in a USA Cricket training camp.

    "body": "The final league fixture of the 2024 Major League Cricket (MLC) will witness the Texas Super Kings (TSK) take on the Seattle Orcas (SOR). The contest is a dead rubber to a degree with TSK having sealed a place in the Eliminator clash, while SOR have also officially finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nDespite their fate being sealed, both sides would love to end the league stage on a high. TSK will look for some momentum ahead of the high-octane Eliminator clash against the MI New York, especially having lost to the Washington Freedom by a significant margin.\n\nThe Seattle Orcas, on the other hand, have to play for their pride. Following a successful maiden season in 2023 where they finished as runner-ups, the franchise could only compile a single win this time around and are currently on a four-game losing streak.\n\nEven though it has not been a very memorable season for both sides, particularly the Seattle Orcas, there have been some standout individual performers from both sides. On that note, let us take a look at a combined Texas Super Kings-Seattle Orcas playing 11 for MLC 2024.\n\nTop order: Faf du Plessis, Ryan Rickleton, and Quinton de Kock\n\nTSK skipper Faf du Plessis is the leading scorer of the tournament so far with 264 runs in five matches at a strike rate of 166.03. He recorded a stunning hundred against the Washington Freedom and has scored consecutive fifties in his last two appearances against the MI New York and the reverse fixture against the Washington Freedom.\n\nAfter a prolific SA20 2024 campaign where he ended up as the leading run scorer, Rickleton has carried the same form into the MLC as well. He was part of the South Africa squad that finished runner-ups in the 2024 T20 World Cup but failed to avail a single chance in the playing XI. In the ongoing season, he has accumulated 225 runs in five innings at a strike rate of 149.\n\nQuinton de Kock has donned the role at No.3 with the Seattle Orcas, and he has done a decent job of it. The left-handed wicket-keeper batter has scored 144 runs in six outings at a strike rate of 123.07.\n\nMiddle Order: Heinrich Klaasen, Marcus Stoinis, and Calvin Savage\n\nThe Seattle Orcas skipper had memorable IPL and T20 World Cup campaigns, despite ending up as runner-ups in both. However, his momentum seems to have run its course for the momentum as he had a mediocre MLC 2024 season. He has only scored 93 runs in six matches, including one fifty. However, he still remains one of the best batters in the format, and remains a threat for the opposition.\n\nStoinis came into the MLC on the back of a brilliant 2024 T20 World Cup for Australia. The all-rounder has been decent with the bat and expensive with the ball but has been among the wickets in a very short time.\n\nCalvin Savage has been a handy player for TSK in the lower middle order. He has scored 75 runs in four innings at a strike rate of 153, including a quick-fire 35 in TSK's most recent outing.\n\nLower Order: Imad Wasim, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Gannon, Zia-ul-Haq, and Harmeet Singh\n\nCameron Gannon is among the leading wicket-takers in the tournament with 10 wickets in six matches. The pacer is the joint second-highest wicket-taker along with Rashid Khan. Although his economy is a bit on the higher side, he is an able spearhead to the bowling attack.\n\nThe TSK pace bowling duo of Dwayne Bravo and Zia-ul-Haq are valuable additions to the attack to bring balance and variety. Zia-ul-Haq is the joint-highest wicket-taker for TSK with six scalps. while the veteran Bravo has picked up four wickets in four matches, with an economy of 8.36 while bowling the tough overs.\n\nThe spin attack of Imad Wasim and Harmeet Singh has been difficult for the batters to deal with considering their varied skill set. The left-arm finger spinners have picked up a combined total of 12 wickets, with their average economy reading just 7.10.",
    "summary": "* The final league fixture of MLC 2024 will feature Texas Super Kings (TSK) against Seattle Orcas (SOR), with TSK already securing a spot in the Eliminator clash and SOR finishing at the bottom of the table.\n* Both teams aim to end the league stage on a high, with TSK seeking momentum ahead of their Eliminator clash against MI New York and SOR playing for pride.\n* Despite a disappointing season, there have been standout individual performers from both teams, including Faf du Plessis, Ryan Rickleton, Quinton de Kock, Heinrich Klaasen, Marcus Stoinis, Calvin Savage, Imad Wasim, Dwayne Bravo, Cameron Gannon, Zia-ul-Haq, and Harmeet Singh.\n* These players have contributed to their teams with impressive batting and bowling performances, with some of them being among the top scorers and wicket-takers in the tournament.",

San Francisco Unicorns are up against Washington Freedom in an important clash on Tuesday, July 23.\n\nWashington Freedom have been unbeaten throughout this tournament so far.

On the other hand, San Francisco Unicorns are placed second with four wins and nine points from six clashes.\n\nThey also beat the Seattle Orcas coming into this game. Both teams have already made it to the Qualifier of MLC 2024, which will be played on July 26. This game will thus serve as a preparatory ground as they will face each other yet again.\n\nOn that note, here is a combined playing 11 with players from both sides ahead of their final league stage match.\n\nCombined San Francisco Unicorns-Washington Freedom playing 11 for MLC 2024\n\nOpeners: Finn Allen, Travis Head\n\nFinn Allen, with 186 runs from five innings at a strike-rate of 202.17, is the fifth-highest run-getter of the tournament. He has scored the most runs for San Francisco this year.\n\nIn their previous outing against Seattle, Allen struck a brutal 30-ball 77, striking at 256.66, that helped them chase down a total of 152 with ease.\n\nPartnering him at the top would be Travis Head, who has also displayed great form for Washington Freedom. With 194 runs from six games, he is the third-highest run-getter of the MLC 2024.\n\nHead has been consistent throughout, smashing three fifties and a hundred, including a 22-ball 53 in the last match.\n\nMiddle-order and all-rounders: Steve Smith (C), Rachin Ravindra, Andries Gous (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Obus Pienaar, Corey Anderson\n\nSteve Smith has proved to be a great inclusion for Washington Freedom this season. He has scored 191 runs from six innings at an average of 63.66 and is the fourth-highest run-getter as well.\n\nThe Washington Freedom skipper scored a crucial 57 in the last game and would also captain this combined side.\n\nRachin Ravindra may not have shone with the bat in the MLC 2024 so far, scoring only 69 runs from four innings. However, he has been a key asset with the ball for Washington Freedom, picking up five wickets, including a four-fer in their previous fixture.\n\nAndries Gous would handle the wicket-keeping duties. He has a fifty to his name this season and has displayed some power-hitting ability. Gous scored a quickfire 9-ball 15 in the last game as well.\n\nGlenn Maxwell has not been as effective with the bat this season yet. He has only managed to score 59 runs from three innings. However, he scored a crucial 23-ball 34 in the previous match and grabbed three wickets as well. His all-round skills make him a valuable asset.\n\nObus Pienaar played a vital role in giving Washington Freedom a solid finish with the bat in their last match. He scored an unbeaten 21-ball 33. Pienaar has displayed his ability to provide stability down the order and contribute with some important runs as well.\n\nCorey Anderson is another all-round who would add to the strength of this combined team. He has a high score of an unbeaten 59 this season and also picked up a wicket in the last game against Texas.\n\nBowlers: Hassan Khan, Jasdeep Singh, Lockie Ferguson\n\nLeft-arm spinner Hassan Khan has picked up six wickets in the tournament for the San Francisco Unicorns. He impressed in the previous game, returning with figures of 3/5 from his two overs, thus also being economical.\n\nJasdeep Singh, coming in for Saurabh Netravalkar, had big shoes to fill in. The right-arm pacer has been brilliant for Washington Freedom in his limited opportunities this season.\n\nJasdeep has picked up six wickets from just two games at an economy rate of 5.57.

To start, Finn Allen was sent packing on the very first ball of the innings by Akeal Hosein.\n\nDespite the early setback, Jake Fraser-McGurk and Sanjay Krishnamurthi took an aggressive approach, smashing 42 runs in the reduced Powerplay of 4 overs. However, Fraser-McGurk was caught behind by Andries Gous off Andrew Tye in the next over, having scored 18 off 9 balls.\n\nKrishnamurthi, who was dropped by Mukhtar Ahmed at 13 in the second over, reached his fifty off 28 balls in the eighth over. Meanwhile, Josh Inglis delivered a blistering innings of 45 runs off just 17 balls, featuring six sixes and just one four. He smashed three consecutive sixes off Jack Edwards in the ninth over, reducing the target to 67 runs needed from 30 balls.\n\nTye, who was hit for two sixes by Inglis in the second and third balls of his second over, had the last laugh as he dismissed Inglis on the fourth ball and went on to strike again, removing Sherfane Rutherford on the last ball of the 10th over.\n\nKrishnamurthi then took charge of the run chase, teaming up with Hassan Khan to score 33 runs in the next two overs, reducing the target to 22 runs needed from 12 balls. Riding on stunning momentum, both batters chased down the target with ease with two balls to spare.\n\nEarlier in the contest, Steve Smith and Travis Head gave Washington Freedom a flying start, amassing 70 runs in the Powerplay. The pair brought up the team's 100-run mark in 9.3 overs. However, Smith was dismissed by Corey Anderson on the next ball, scoring a remarkable 56 off 31 balls.\n\nHead continued his red-hot form as he reached his fourth successive fifty in 34 balls, but was also dismissed by Anderson in the 12th over after scoring 56 off 36 balls, leaving Washington at 122/2.\n\nRachin Ravindra then played a quick cameo, scoring 16 off 6 balls before getting run out in the 14th over. Gous (29* off 20) continued to find timely boundaries until rain halted play after 15.3 overs, with Washington at 174/3.

The wicket of Jason Holder showed the world what he's got.\"\n\nEngland will now target a series sweep when the Windies go to Edgbaston next week, before taking on Sri Lanka in three Tests between late August and early September.\n\n\"It has been a great start after a long break between Test series. I think we've played some good cricket but I still think we can get better,\" Stokes said.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to the next four matches.\"\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events on the fourth day of the second Test at Trent Bridge, the West Indies suffered a resounding 241-run defeat to England, sealing a 2-0 series loss with one Test still to play. Despite the crushing defeat, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite remained optimistic, acknowledging the team's effort while highlighting areas for improvement.\n\nEngland's Shoaib Bashir was the star of the match, claiming his first five-wicket haul on English soil. His 5 for 41 wrapped up the West Indies innings inside 90 minutes of the final session, ensuring England's dominant victory.\n\nReflecting on the match, Brathwaite said, \"I'm reasonably happy with the performance, but it could have been better with the ball. We were good in the first innings but didn't follow through in the second. The effort from the guys was there; the fitness is evident. We need to be much more disciplined. England showed us how to bowl on this pitch, particularly avoiding getting hit square of the wicket. But the guys will learn. Kavem's hundred followed by a duck is just how Test cricket goes.\"\n\nBrathwaite continued, \"We dropped some crucial catches, and that happens. We need to improve our line and length, but catches win matches. I wouldn't have expected that collapse, but it's gone, it's history. Test cricket is never an easy game. We've got to stay tough and keep fighting.\"\n\nEngland's comprehensive win was set up by centuries from Joe Root and Harry Brook, who propelled the hosts to 425 in their second innings. This marked the first time in England's history that they scored over 400 runs in both innings of a Test. Chasing a daunting target of 385, the West Indies started positively, reaching 61 without loss thanks to Brathwaite and Mikyle Louis. However, a devastating spell from Chris Woakes and Bashir saw the team crumble, losing 5 for 21 in the space of 35 balls and ultimately bowled out for 143.\n\nBrathwaite was the top scorer for the West Indies with 47 runs, but his efforts were overshadowed by Bashir's record-breaking performance. At 20 years and 282 days, Bashir became the youngest England bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a men's Test at home, surpassing the previous record held by recently retired seamer James Anderson.\n\nEngland's first innings score of 416, bolstered by Ollie Pope's 121 and contributions from Ben Duckett and Ben Stokes, set the stage for their commanding position. The West Indies initially responded well with 457, featuring a century from Hodge and notable performances from Da Silva and Athanaze. However, the team faltered in their second innings, leading to a decisive English victory.",

    "body": "In a match curtailed by rain, the San Francisco Unicorns emerged victorious over the Washington Freedom by six wickets in the Major League Cricket at Dallas on Sunday. The Unicorns chased down a revised target of 177 runs in 13.4 overs, with Sanjay Krishnamurthi’s unbeaten 79 being the cornerstone of their chase. However, the highlight of the match was undoubtedly Akeal Hosein’s dismissal of Finn Allen for a golden duck.\n\nAkil Hossein’s deadly delivery\n\nWhile Krishnamurthi’s inning was undoubtedly crucial, Hosein’s dismissal of Finn captured everyone’s attention. Allen, known for his aggressive batting, came to the crease with high expectations. However, Hosein had other plans.\n\nThe left-arm spinner delivered a skiddy delivery that came into the right-hander. Allen, looking to pull, was deceived by the pace and trajectory of the ball. The delivery crashed into the middle stump, leaving Allen stunned and Washington’s dugout in jubilation.\n\nHosein’s dismissal of Allen was a crucial breakthrough for Washington. It put a dent in the Unicorns’ batting lineup and gave the Freedoms a much-needed early advantage. The wicket also showcased Hossein’s skill and ability to deliver under pressure.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Kieron Pollard’s heartfelt gesture after accidentally hitting a fan with his six in MLC 2024\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns ends the winning streak of Washington Freedom\n\nThe Freedom, batting first, managed to post a respectable total of 174 runs for the loss of three wickets in their allotted 15.3 overs. Steve Smith and Travis Head both contributed half-centuries, but the innings lacked the momentum they needed. Corey Anderson was the pick of the Unicorns’ bowlers, finishing with figures of 2 for 20.\n\nThe Unicorns’ chase started off under immense pressure, losing openers James Frazer-Mcgirk and Allen, both early in the second innings, with the sheer determination and intent of Josh Inglis and Krishnamurthi putting on a 70-run stand. Inglis made a quickfire 45 before being dismissed, but Krishnamurthi continued his assault on the Freedom bowlers. He remained unbeaten on 79, guiding his team to victory with four balls to spare.\n\nThe victory for the Unicorns was a significant one, as it helped them consolidate their position in the points table. The Freedom, on the other hand, will be disappointed with their performance and will need to regroup for their next match as it ended the winning streak for them facing their first loss of the tournament.",

    "body": "In a thrilling chase at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, MI New York secured a dramatic four-wicket victory over the Los Angeles Knight Riders in match 19 of the Major League Cricket 2024, booking their place in the playoffs. The chase, however, wasn’t without its hiccups. Chasing a modest target of 135, New York found themselves in a precarious position at 102/5 in the 13th over. But then came the turning point of the match – Kieron Pollard‘s awe-inspiring display of power hitting.\n\nKieron Pollard unleashes a six-hitting frenzy.\n\nWith the pressure mounting and playoffs hanging in the balance, Pollard stepped onto the field, shouldering the responsibility of reviving his team’s fortunes. The 14th over witnessed a masterclass in power hitting as Pollard took on LA Knight Riders’ bowler Spencer Johnson.\n\nThe first ball was dispatched over mid-wicket for a six, setting the tone for what was to come. Johnson attempted to change tactics with a length ball angling in, but Pollard responded with a monstrous 91-meter six over square leg. The crowd roared in appreciation as Pollard completed the hattrick of sixes with a disdainful chip over the bowler’s head for another maximum.\n\nThese three consecutive sixes not only yielded 18 crucial runs but also completely shifted the match’s momentum. The required run rate, once a daunting task, suddenly seemed achievable. Pollard continued his assault, adding another boundary and bringing his side to an easy match-winning situation with a well-made 33 runs off just 12 deliveries.\n\nHere’s the video:\n\nAlso WATCH: Pat Cummins and Corey Anderson star in the comedy of errors on the pitch in MLC 2024\n\nNicholas Pooran’s professional approach gets MI through to playoffs\n\nEarlier, despite Andre Russell‘s 35, LA Knight Riders failed miserably as a batting unit. They started badly and consistently lost wickets, where the middle order could not make a comeback, with many returning to the pavilion scoring single digits. Ultimately, they were restricted to 130 runs thanks to bowling spells from Rashid Khan (3/22) and Nosthush Kenjige (2/22).\n\nOn the other hand, New York started shaky and under immense pressure. Nicholas Pooran took his side home with an assured victory in hand before his fall at the 16th over, scoring a crucial knock of 35 runs.",
