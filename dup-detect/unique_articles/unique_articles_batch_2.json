    "body": "Saurabh Netravalkar, a fast bowler from the USA, has been making waves in international cricket. Born in India, he represented the country in the Under-19 World Cup and shared the field with players like Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh.\n\nAfter moving to the USA for his studies, Netravalkar balanced his career as a software developer and a cricketer. His recent performances in the T20 World Cup 2024 and Major League Cricket 2024 have been remarkable that has earned him widespread praise.\n\nBET NOW: Exclusive sign-up offers and bonuses when you bet on sporting action\n\nIn a recent interview, Saurabh Netravalkar expressed his desire to play in the IPL 2025.\n\nWhat did Saurabh Netravalkar say on playing IPL 2025?\n\nBefore the T20 World Cup 2024, Netravalkar had said that USA is his karmabhumi (land of work), while India is his janmabhumi (motherland). He has done quite a lot for his land of work, so when asked about his interest in playing for his motherland, India, in the prestigious league, Netravalkar replied:\n\n\"I mean, that is not in my hands. If the selection happens, it happens. I will try and let's see.\"\n\nHow did Netravalkar perform in T20 World Cup 2024?\n\nNetravalkar has been instrumental in the USA's surprising run in the T20 World Cup. The USA defeated Canada and Pakistan in the group stages. He contributed in restricting Pakistan to 159/7 by taking 2 wickets for just 18 runs in 4 overs and bowled a match-winning super over.\n\nMore: Did Rohit Sharma photoshop training picture to show a fitter body? Fans go crazy over Sri Lanka training image\n\nHow did Netravalkar perform in Major League Cricket 2024?\n\nIn addition to his World Cup heroics, Netravalkar shined in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. He was the top wicket-taker with 15 wickets in 7 games. His team, Washington Freedom, won the title, which added to his growing reputation.\n\nAndy Flower, former Zimbabwe player and current Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) head coach, who worked with Netravalkar in the ILT20 league, praised his skills and professionalism. He sees Netravalkar as a left-arm swing bowler who excels in death overs.\n\n\"His stocks have flown off the roof. Very skillful and a great man around the team. People will be looking and thinking, that's a left-arm swing bowler who can also bowl for us at the death,\" Flower told ESPN Cricinfo.\n\nWhen is the IPL Mega Auction?\n\nThe dates for IPL 2025 mega auction haven‚Äôt been made official yet but like the previous auctions, it's highly likely that the mega auction will be conducted in December 2024 or February 2025.\n\nWhen does IPL 2025 start?\n\nIPL 2025 is likely to start from March 23, 2025 up until May 29, 2025. The dates haven't been made official by the BCCI yet and might change in due course of time.\n\nWith his impressive record, Netravalkar could be a sought-after player in the auction. As he sets his sights on the IPL 2025, fans and cricket experts alike will be watching closely to see if he can make a mark in one of the world's most prestigious cricket leagues.",

    "body": "Emerging Cricket takes a look at the domestic contributors for MLC finalists San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom ahead of Sunday‚Äôs MLC Final. The Bart King award will likely come down to SF‚Äôs Hassan Khan and Washington‚Äôs Saurabh Netravalkar. It‚Äôs all up for grabs on Sunday in Grand Prairie.\n\nWashington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns made waves in the lead up to the 2024 Major League Cricket season with big name overseas signings. For the Freedom, it was the addition of Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head. For the Unicorns, it was Pat Cummins and young phenom Jake Fraser-McGurk. But an injection of Australian cricket royalty isn‚Äôt enough on its own to carry a team to the league final, no matter how potent the dose.\n\nWith the requirement of five domestics in every playing eleven, teams need to find the right mix to supplement their well known international stars to go deep in a longer tournament than the inaugural edition. And to those who follow American domestic cricket closely, it should come as no surprise that San Francisco and Washington are meeting in the final.\n\nSunday‚Äôs final might also determine more than just the 2024 MLC Champions. The favorites for the Bart King Domestic Player of the Tournament Award are Washington‚Äôs Saurabh Netravalkar and San Francisco‚Äôs Hassan Khan. In 2023, the award went to Seattle Orcas bowler Cameron Gannon, a consolation prize for falling to MI New York in the championship game. This year the prize will likely go to whomever makes a bigger mark in Sunday‚Äôs final.\n\nDomestic Bowlers set the table for Washington‚Äôs overseas batting power\n\nWashington‚Äôs Saurabh Netravalkar, the left handed Oracle developer who stole hearts and inspired memes during the T20 World Cup, is the current league leader in wickets with 14. This in spite of missing two games to attend the birth of his first child. Tack that on to his ten wickets from six games in 2023, including the tournament‚Äôs best ever figures of six wickets for nine runs, and Washington have perhaps the most valuable domestic player across the league‚Äôs first two seasons.\n\nAlong with Netravalkar, Washington returned three other regular domestic starters from 2023 in Obus Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed and Andries Gous, fresh from impressing at the World Cup with Saurabh.\n\nWith the bat, the Freedom have benefited heavily from the good form of their overseas stars. Travis Head currently sits at second in the league with 327 runs for the season, at an average of 54.50 and strike rate of 173.93 and five half centuries in only eight games. Head also tops the leaderboards for both fours (43) and sixes (23). Captain Steve Smith sits only two places behind Head in the league run rankings with 248 at an average of 49.60 and a strike rate of 142.52 and two fifties.\n\nWashington‚Äôs batting has been so reliable, in fact, that they‚Äôve only had eight different batters take strike this season, and only four with more than four innings. Eight half centuries from overseas batters have surely limited chances for middle order domestic batters like Pienaar, Mukhtar Ahmed and Lahiru Milantha.\n\nFrom the domestic batters, Andries Gous has enjoyed consistent chances in the top order, batting six times out of seven games played, also missing a game for the birth of a child. While Gous displayed the ability to change gears in the World Cup, he‚Äôs played more of a supporting role with the Freedom this season, often conceding strike to a hot partner while staying alive in the middle for an average of 44 and strike rate of 115.78, not out three times.\n\nWashington domestic batters do what‚Äôs needed\n\nIn all, Washington domestics faced 211 balls (29.84% of the team‚Äôs total) and scored 253 of the team‚Äôs 1029 batted runs (24.59%). The low strike rate can be attributed to the support role of Gous at the top, and to a match saving 63 run partnership between Pienaar and Milantha against Seattle that began after the first ball of the tenth over with Washington at 64 runs for five wickets chasing 124, ending triumphantly after the second ball of the 19th over. In short, Washington domestic batters have gotten the job done when needed, reflected in their collective batting average of 63.25.\n\nThose sizing up the Freedom roster could see that the team would lean heavily on domestic bowling. Netravalkar, Justin Dill and Akhilesh Bodugum were retained, while Ian Holland, Amilla Aponso and U23 Yasir Mohammad were acquired in the 2024 domestic draft. The variety and depth was obvious and high volume was a certainty, but the question would be what combination of fast and spin bowling would Washington utilize?\n\nFive different domestics have bowled for Washington, accounting for 47.5% of the team‚Äôs volume, led by Netravalkar‚Äôs 22.2 overs. As a team, Washington‚Äôs bowling economy is a glorious 7.746, and they take a wicket every 19.26 runs. Domestics have taken 35 out of the team‚Äôs 58 wickets (60.34%) at an average of only 15.37, while going only slightly more expensive (7.864 economy) than their overseas teammates (7.649 economy).\n\nNext man up: Depth matters\n\nJessy Singh, released by New York following a 2023 season in which he bowled in just one game, found himself without a team after March‚Äôs 2024 MLC domestic draft. Just a few months later, Jessy appeared in five games for USA in the T20 World Cup. Though he claimed the wicket of Babar Azam in USA‚Äôs famous upset victory over Pakistan, the remainder of the tournament came with mixed performances. The supplemental draft came and went with Jessy again unselected.\n\nJessy kept in game condition by bowling in the nets for MI New York until Washington added him to the roster in Netravalkar‚Äôs absence. He was put straight into the eleven and rewarded the Freedom with two MVP efforts in two games, giving the team three such performances from domestics this season.\n\n‚ÄúNone of these guys have seen me in person, it speaks highly about them. They backed me to be in the eleven today, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting,‚Äù Jessy said in a Washington Freedom social media video following his Freedom debut. ‚ÄúIt never felt like it‚Äôs my first game with the franchise, just coming in.‚Äù\n\nBalance is key for San Francisco\n\nFor San Francisco, domestic balance has been found throughout both the batting order and bowling attack. Quite literally.\n\nHassan Khan, Brody Couch, Liam PLunkett, Carmi Le Roux, Juanoy Drysdale, Tajinder Singh and captain Corey Anderson have combined for 72 of the Unicorns 143.5 overs this season. Their domestic corps has taken 28 of 38 wickets and outperforms overseas bowlers in economy, 8.319 to 8.812, averaging only 21.39 runs per wicket compared to a whopping 63.30 from overseas bowlers.\n\nWhile Hassan Khan has been the clear star, taking 9 wickets at an economy of 6.33 in 18 overs and scoring 191 runs at a strike rate of 140.44 and average of 47.75, Corey Anderson has provided the Unicorns with yet another domestic all round performer. While he‚Äôs done a bit less with the bat than you‚Äôd expect (111 runs at 127.58 SR and 27.75 average), Corey has utilized his left arm to fill gaps in the overs to the tune of 8.1 overs at 8.69 with four wickets. Corey also took one of the best catches you‚Äôll ever see against TSK on Friday night.\n\nBut it‚Äôs Corey‚Äôs captaincy and familiarity with the domestic players that really makes him stand out. Juanoy Drysdale attributed his early comfort coming into the team in part to Corey‚Äôs ‚Äúcalm, cool and collected personality.‚Äù\n\nDepth matters, part two\n\nIn just three games, Drysdale has given San Francisco their very own Jessy Singh.\n\nWhen Liam Plunkett was ruled out with an injury after playing in four games, the Unicorns had a roster spot to fill. Drysdale had been named as a reserve for USA Cricket during the World Cup, but never got called up to appear in a game. Like Jessy, Juanoy was passed up in the MLC domestic draft and again in the supplemental draft.\n\nHoning his craft with The Philadelphians of Minor League Cricket, Drysdale had another familiar face to ease him into the squad. ‚ÄúPlaying with Liam Plunkett as a coach and mentor in the minor league has been incredibly beneficial,‚Äù Drysdale told Emerging Cricket. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned a lot from him, especially about being a Pro Athlete. His guidance has played a crucial role in preparing me for the MLC. Happy to be here!‚Äù\n\nAnd after Friday‚Äôs win to advance to the MLC Final, the Unicorns must be happy to have him. With San Francisco defending 200 runs against the potent Texas Super Kings in front of a big Super Kings home crowd, Juanoy struck in the 8th over to get Aaron Hardle while the home team was cruising at 84 for the loss of just one. In his very next over, the tenth of the Super Kings innings, Juanoy struck again, claiming Marcus Stoinis for just one run.\n\nBrody Couch and Carmi le Roux have also expressed great talent, combining for eight wickets in eight innings between them, while Plunkett took five wickets before bowing out of the tournament. These performances from domestic fast bowlers were crucial considering the underwhelming output from Pat Cummings so far, who has struck only twice in 19 overs.\n\nDomestic batting: MLC‚Äôs true unicorn\n\nBut unlike the Freedom, the Unicorns have had to rely regularly on their domestic batters to get to this point. Particularly in the middle order. Facing 358 (42.27%) of 847 deliveries this season, and striking at 129.60, San Francisco‚Äôs domestic batters have pulled their weight.\n\nAlong with Khan and Anderson, 21 year old Bay Area resident Sanjay Krishnamurthi has been a major bright spot for the team. After appearing in zero games in 2023, the Unicorns retained Sanjay as their U23 and spoke highly of his talent and potential. Unicorns leadership have put their money where their mouth is in 2024, playing Sanjay in all eight games. The young gun‚Äôs performance on Monday Night against this Freedom squad was the best from a domestic batter this season.\n\nWith San Francisco chasing 174 in a game shortened to 14 overs by rain, star batter Finn Allen got out on the very first ball. Sanjay and Jake Fraser-McGurk would team up for 45 runs before the young Aussie edged Andrew Tye straight back to Gous in the fifth over. Sanjay tacked on another 77 with Josh Inglis (45 from 17) in a hurry and everything was looking sparkly for the Unicorns until Tye struck again, taking both Inglis and Sherfane Rutherford in the 10th over.\n\nHassan Khan (32 from 11) would help Sanjay take it home with two balls to spare, and the Unicorns would hand the Freedom their first loss of the season. Sanjay‚Äôs brave innings, highlighted by a memorable one handed six over third man against Netravalkar, would end with the Unicorns over the line, not out after scoring 79 from 42 with a half dozen sixes.\n\nFriday‚Äôs Qualifier was a rematch, and Washington had their revenge, holding San Francisco to just 145 runs and chasing it down with 27 balls in hand. Sunday‚Äôs final will be the tiebreaker for the season, and it will likely determine the Bart King award winner.\n\nThese are two teams with so much in common and so much to prove. Two teams not affiliated with IPL franchises. Two teams that bat a domestic at number three. Two teams that have featured domestic fast bowling replacements who have had big moments in big wins. Two teams that have awarded game MVP to domestics three times each. Two teams that have had to build their brand from scratch. Considering the nature of the contests so far between these two teams, we might have MLC‚Äôs first truly organic rivalry.\n\nYou‚Äôre reading Emerging Cricket ‚Äî brought to you by a passionate group of volunteers with a vision for cricket to be a truly global sport, and a mission to inspire passion to grow the game.\n\nBe sure to check out our homepage for all the latest news, please subscribe for regular updates, and follow EC on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube.",

Even though MyKhel.com could not verify if the Australian star was earlier following the franchise, several fans and RCB fan handles made the claim on X.\n\nNotably, the much-awaited meeting of the IPL owners with the BCCI is also scheduled to be held on Tuesday, July 30 in Mumbai. The meeting is expected to give clarity on the number of retentions teams can make.\n\nGlenn Maxwell was bought by RCB for Rs 14.25 crore ahead of IPL 2021, and was retained for Rs 11 crore the following year. He fetched the same amount in 2023 and 2024.\n\nHowever, his performance saw a massive dip in the last season in which he scored 52 runs in 10 matches at an average of 5.78 and a strike rate of 120.93. He took a voluntary break midway through the tournament to get into a better mental space, but failed once again on his return ahead of the play-offs. In the Eliminator, he was dismissed for a first-ball duck as RCB lost to Rajasthan Royals.\n\nGlenn Maxwell was axed from Punjab Kings squads after a similar horror run in IPL 2020. In that season, he scored 108 runs in 13 matches at an average of 15.42 and a strike rate of 101.88.\n\nVirat kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell formed a formidable trio at RCB even though they failed to hand RCB their maiden IPL trophy. But going by the latest developments, it's very likely that Maxwell and du Plessis would be released by the Bengaluru-based franchise.\n\nThe IPL owners meeting with the BCCI will also have discussion over the reintroduction of Right-To-Match option (RTM). The owners are keen on having the option to five to six retentions. If the RTM option is brought back, or an increased number of retentions are allowed, RCB could look to retain Maxwell at a lower price.",

    "body": "Former Australian cricket team‚Äôs captain Steve Smith recently led his side the Washington Freedom to their maiden Major League Cricket (MLC) title, beating the San Francisco Unicorns in the final match to win the coveted MLC 2024 Trophy. Steve Smith played a key role for his team as a captain and batter.\n\nFind Best Betting Tips and Predictions for India vs Sri Lanka Series Here\n\nAlthough Steve Smith is not very much known for his T20 game, Smith proved everyone wrong in the MLC. There were much confusion among the cricket enthusiasts as to why the Ricky Ponting led side opted to bring Steve Smith into the fold that included players like Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell etc.\n\nBut Steve Smith proved all his doubters wrong. The Washington Freedom finished at the top of the table with 5 wins and 1 loss from their 7 matches. The 35-years-old Steve Smith led side dominated the playoffs, beating the San Francisco Unicorns in the Qualifier and the Final by 7 wickets and 96 runs respectively.\n\nNot only did Steve Smith led his side really well, he contributed significantly with the bat as well. Smith scored 336 runs from 9 innings with a strike rate of 148.67 and average of 56. With this brilliant performance from Smith, he certainly has managed to turn some IPL teams‚Äô attention towards himself, especially some teams who maybe looking for a new captain in the upcoming IPL 2025 Mega Auction later this year. In this article, we take a look at _ teams who maybe to willing to sign Steve Smith as captain for IPL 2025.\n\nPunjab Kings\n\nAn Australian captain and Punjab Kings is a good combination. Punjab Kings (Formerly Kings XI Punjab) reached their last IPL final way back in the year 2014, which unfortunately they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders. They had an Australian George Bailey as their captain. Since then, Glenn Maxwell has been the other Aussie to captain Punjab, but they never reached the previous heights again. The Kings recently had Shikhar Dhawan and Sam Curran as captain in IPL 2024 and it seems they will be looking for a captain in the IPL 2025 Mega Auction. In that case, Steve Smith can be an option Punjab Kings may go after. Smith would easily be able to give them 2 seasons atleast as captain.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have had the privilege of having some really great captains over the years in the IPL, the likes of Virat Kohli and current Faf du Plessis. However, there might be some debate of captaincy options at RCB as their current captain Faf du Plessis is currently 40-years-old. In that case, Steve Smith would be a good short-term captaincy option for them to prepare their next captain as Smith would easily be able to give 2 season.\n\nLucknow Super Giants\n\nSteve Smith already has a relationship with the Super Giants. Steve Smith was with the Rising Pune Supergiant in the IPL in 2016 and 2017, when they joined the league in place of CSK and Rajasthan, where he replaced MS Dhoni as the captain of the team and led his side to the final, which unfortunately they lost against Mumbai Indians by 1 run. Since then, Smith only featured in the 2021 IPL season for Delhi Capitals and never found a place again. Lucknow Super Giants have the same owners as Pune Supergiant and with team‚Äôs captain KL Rahul likely to leave, the management might turn to their former leader Steve Smith.",
    "summary": "* Steve Smith led his team, Washington Freedom, to their maiden MLC title, defeating San Francisco Unicorns in the final.\n* Despite doubts about his T20 skills, Smith proved himself as a captain and batter, leading his team to the top of the table with 5 wins and 1 loss in 7 matches.\n* Smith scored 336 runs from 9 innings with a strike rate of 148.67 and an average of 56.\n* His impressive performance has turned the attention of some IPL teams towards him, potentially as a captain for the upcoming IPL 2025 Mega Auction.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to summarize anything else!",

    "body": "Preparations for the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 are in full swing. This time, a mega auction is set to take place, where players will see a significant influx of money. Teams are keeping an eye on players who have recently performed well. Currently, various T20 leagues are ongoing worldwide, with players showcasing their talents. Recently, the Major League Cricket 2024 in the USA concluded, where Washington Freedom emerged as the champions. Three players stood out with their performances this season, demonstrating that they are ready to shine in IPL 2025.\n\nThese players include New Zealand‚Äôs Finn Allen, former Australian captain Steve Smith, and USA‚Äôs star bowler Saurabh Netravalkar. All three players impressed with their performances in Major League Cricket 2024. If these players enter the IPL mega auction, they could command high bids.\n\nFinn Allen (New Zealand) (IPL 2025)\n\nFinn Allen was the third-highest run-scorer in Major League Cricket 2024. He batted explosively throughout the season, scoring 306 runs in 9 innings at an average of 34 and a strike rate of 187.73. Allen notched up one century and two fifties during the season.\n\nFinn Allen hails from New Zealand and has previously played in the IPL, but he went unsold in the last auction. This time, teams will be eager to acquire him. In the mega auction, he could attract bids worth millions as he fulfills the role of a powerful opener for any team.\n\nSteve Smith (Australia)\n\nSteve Smith was the second top-scorer of the season, delivering remarkable performances. As captain of Washington Freedom, Smith scored 336 runs in 9 matches at an average of 56.00 and a strike rate of 148. He hit three fifties and played as an opening batsman, providing quick starts alongside Travis Head, leading his team to victory.\n\nSteve Smith is known as a player for ODIs and Tests. He went unsold in the IPL 2024 auction and was subsequently left out of Australia‚Äôs T20 World Cup 2024 squad. However, following his strong performance in Major League Cricket, Smith is expected to be in high demand in the IPL 2025 mega auction.\n\nAlso read: How Many Retentions will be Allowed in IPL 2025 Auction? Details Revealed\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar (USA)\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar impressed everyone with his bowling in the T20 World Cup 2024. An Indian-origin player who shifted to the USA years ago, Netravalkar has played for India‚Äôs U-19 team. In Major League Cricket 2024, he took 15 wickets in 7 matches at an economy rate of 7.67 for the champion team Washington Freedom.\n\nSaurabh is a left-arm fast bowler who excels in bowling during the powerplay and has the skill to maintain accurate line and length in death overs. Scoring against him is not easy for any batter. This is why, when Saurabh enters the IPL 2025 mega auction, franchises are expected to bid heavily to secure his services.",
    "summary": "**Major League Cricket 2024**\n\n* The tournament has concluded in the USA.\n* Washington Freedom emerged as the champions.\n* Three standout players from the tournament are:\n\t1.

    "body": "Major League Cricket 2024 attracted a lot of viewers this time around. Hence, a few IPL teams would consider this league while planning for their squads next season. Here, we take a look at the list of three top performers in MLC 2024 who might be selected for the IPL 2025 Mega Auctions.\n\n1) Finn Allen\n\nWith a strike rate close to 190, Finn Allen was in brilliant touch in MLC 2024. He also scored a lot of runs and that makes him an exciting option to have in the team.\n\nFinn Allen was in RCB a few years ago but did not get a single game. Considering he is also a reliable wicket-keeper, he could be a must-have for some teams. The Kiwi is still young and would be an investment for the future. Therefore, many franchises could line up for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Steve Smith\n\nSteve Smith is one of the top performers in MLC 2024 who might be selected for the IPL 2025 Mega Auctions. The Australian cricketer was in brilliant form in the tournament. He finished as the second-highest run-getter and also won the tournament as the skipper.\n\nThere would be some teams who would like to have the experience and skills of Steve Smith at the top of the order. If needed, teams like Punjab Kings could also take him as the skipper. Hence, he is on this list.\n\n3) Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nThe USA cricketer had a strong run in the 2024 T20 World Cup. With 15 wickets, he also finished as the highest wicket-taker of MLC 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaurabh is basically excellent with the new ball, especially with his movement and his angle. If not as the lead overseas pacer, as a backup, he would be a solid choice to have in the team. Mumbai Indians usually prefer to have two left-arm seamers in the squad. Therefore, such teams could target the cricketer.",

    "body": "The Cognizant Major League Cricket Season 2 final took place in Grand Prairie Texas on Sunday night with the Washington Freedom taking on the San Francisco Unicorns before an energetic sold-out crowd.\n\nFans started pouring into the stadium early, and many stayed well past the closing ceremonies, savoring every last minute of their summer of cricket.\n\nThe drones stole the show\n\nWhile the Cognizant Major League Cricket is packed with many of the world‚Äôs top cricketers, several of whom were on the field Sunday, the real star of the event was the drone halftime show.\n\nThe Freedom, who lost the toss, got off to a thundering start putting up a formidable 207 for 5, behind the impressive knocks of Captain Steve Smith (88 off 52 balls including seven 4s and six 6es), Glenn Maxwell (40 off 22 balls) and Andries Gous (21 off 14 balls).\n\nSoon after the Freedom finished their innings, a little past 9PM local time, the stadium lights went off, and fans were treated to a 10 minute display of lights and colors, as an army of drones created picture after cricket-themed picture against a backdrop of music and the pitch black Dallas sky.\n\nAlmost as loud as the hit songs were the roars of the crowd with every scene change.\n\nHere are some of the visual highlights:\n\nGetting their money‚Äôs worth\n\nAfter the drone show, the most popular attraction with fans were, interestingly, the sponsor activation booths.\n\nRoyal Foods was giving out cups of rice and opportunities to join a promotion; and Remitly was giving out merchandise. Fans were lining up in droves for both.\n\nSponsors were front and center later in the evening as well. Two sponsor representatives ‚Äî Todd Myers, COO of Willow TV (which was both a sponsor as well as the official broadcast partner for the US and Canada), and Dominic Rae, Sponsorships Manager for Stake ‚Äî participated in the post-match awards ceremony.\n\nWillow TV‚Äôs Myers presented Saurabh Netravalkar with the tournament‚Äôs Leading Wicket Taker award.\n\nStake‚Äôs Rae, an Australian resident himself, presented Travis Head with the Player of the Tournament award.\n\nIn addition, USA Cricket‚Äôs new CEO, Johnathan Atkeison ‚Äî in attendance a few days before officially starting on the job ‚Äî presented the Domestic Player of the Tournament to the Unicorns‚Äô Hassan Khan.\n\nSlight anticlimax\n\nIn contrast to the Freedom, the Unicorns‚Äô innings fell apart pretty quickly, as they lost three early wickets in the power play. With a high target (208) and a high and climbing required run rate, the pressure resulted in a quick succession of dismissals.\n\nIn the end, they were all out for 111 after only 16 innings.

The talent level in the MLC 2 was probably second only to the IPL as far as T20 tournaments go.\n\nTo top it off, many American cricketers shone brightly throughout July: some cricket household names (Netravalkar, Gous, Ali Khan, and Corey Anderson, among others) and some new stars, including the Unicorns‚Äô Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Hassan Khan (the latter being awarded domestic player of the tournament).\n\nThis was something US cricket fans would never have even dared imagined just a few years ago.\n\nMLC Co-Founder Sameer Mehta summed up the sentiment for us well during the post-match celebrations: ‚Äúlook at this ‚Äî this is all very real.‚Äù\n\nThis statement captured the years of vision and effort on the part of Mehta and his co-founder Vijay Srinivasan to make Sunday happen.\n\nIndeed, major kudos to the MLC team that put on this final as well as the whole tournament: Mehta and Srinivasan, Monica Sadhu, Justin Geale, Zubin Surkari, Mervyn Pereira, William Swann, Selby Sturzenegger, David White, and many others ‚Äî and of course to all the MLC teams and their staffs, and many other outside partners (not least the team from Kojo, spearheaded by Britt Prince).\n\nWe are already getting extremely excited for Season 3.",

    "body": "Dallas [Texas], July 29 (ANI): In a spectacular display of power hitting and strategic bowling, Washington Freedom etched their name on the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 trophy with a massive 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in the championship final at Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nLed by a stellar performance from Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell, Freedom set an imposing target of 208, which proved too steep for the Unicorns to chase in the match on Sunday.\n\nIn need of a strong start, the Unicorns were immediately on the back foot. Jake Fraser-McGurk (3) was dismissed early in the third over, and Marco Jansen (3/28) struck a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen (13), who scored a century in the qualifier. With the score at 30/3, the Unicorns were in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued as Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) fell early, extinguishing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, who was brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, further tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then cleaned out the tail with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the ultimate match of the tournament, the team from Washington lost Head (9) early. Then, Steve Smith (88 in 52 balls, with seven fours and six sixes) took centre stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock.\n\nHe found support in Andries Gous (21 in 14 balls, with three fours and a six), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, finding the boundary with ease.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40 in 22 balls, with a four and four sixes) joined Smith and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as both Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith‚Äôs departure, followed shortly by Maxwell‚Äôs, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. The Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores: Washington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) beat San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs\n\nTOURNAMENT AWARDS:\n\nWINNERS: Washington Freedom\n\nRUNNERS-UP: San Francisco Unicorns\n\nMOST VALUABLE PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Travis Head (Washington Freedom): 336 runs in nine matches at an average of 48.00, strike rate of over 173 and five fifties.\n\nLEADING RUN SCORER: Faf du Plessis (Texas Super Kings): 420 runs in eight innings at an average of 52.50, with a strike rate of over 171 and a century and three fifties.\n\nLEADING WICKET TAKER: Saurabh Netravalkar (Washington Freedom): 15 wickets\n\nDOMESTIC PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT: Hassan Khan (San Francisco Unicorns): 204 runs in eight innings at an average of 40.80, with a fifty and 10 wickets.",

The board, which will meet quarterly with senior CPL staff, includes prominent figures such as West Indies men's white-ball coach Darren Sammy and West Indies women's captain Hayley Matthews.\n\nThe advisory board also features Dr. Akshai Mansingh, CPL‚Äôs Joint Chief Medical Officer, and Dr. Maryam Abdool-Richards, Principal Medical Officer at the Trinidad & Tobago Ministry of Health. This diverse team of experts is tasked with advising the CPL on leveraging its platform to create and promote health and wellness programs.\n\nPete Russell, CPL‚Äôs CEO, expressed enthusiasm about the initiative, stating, \"Health, fitness, and wellbeing are very important issues across the Caribbean and around the world, and we want to use cricket and our platform as a force for good in this area. We are looking forward to working with the advisory board to create meaningful and long-lasting programs that have a positive impact on health and wellbeing across the region. Starting this season, there will be activities at the games that will create a fun vibe around health and fitness, allowing everyone to join in and be part of it.\"\n\nDarren Sammy, the newly appointed West Indies men's head coach, emphasized the importance of health and wellbeing, especially for young people. \"The health and wellbeing of the Caribbean people is hugely important to me, especially our young people who we work very hard through my foundation. I am excited to be involved in this great initiative from CPL and I look forward to being involved in creating meaningful programs that come from this new collaboration.\"\n\nHayley Matthews, West Indies women's captain and a passionate advocate for women's and girls' participation in sports, shared her enthusiasm as well. \"I am passionate about women and girls across the Caribbean being involved in sport and fitness, and I am looking forward to working with the Health and Wellbeing Advisory Board and CPL to create initiatives that will encourage participation. As someone who manages a sporting career while suffering with diabetes, I hope that I can add a unique perspective to the discussions.\"\n\nThe CPL's Health, Fitness, and Wellbeing Advisory Board represents a significant step towards integrating health and wellness into the fabric of Caribbean cricket, ensuring that the sport not only entertains but also contributes positively to the community. The upcoming season will see the introduction of various activities at games designed to promote a fun and engaging atmosphere around health and fitness, inviting fans and participants alike to join in and be part of this initiative.\n\nBrendon McCullum is satisfied with England's progression, but the Test coach says his team know they are not \"the finished article\" just yet.\n\nEngland wrapped up a 3-0 series win over West Indies on Sunday, as Ben Stokes and Mark Wood starred in a 10-wicket victory at Edgbaston.\n\nIt was a memorable series for England, as James Anderson retired following the first Test, while paceman Gus Atkinson showed that there is plenty of hope for the future.\n\n\"I thought, overall, it was a progression of where we wanted to get to as a team,\" coach McCullum told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We're not the finished article ‚Äì we know that. But I think this series has been a step forward for us. It has been a while for us to get a series win and we'll never take that for granted.\"\n\nJamie Smith also impressed, and McCullum was quick to hail the wicketkeeper.\n\n\"When you‚Äôre in that position at seven and wicketkeeper you're like the drummer in the band,\" he said.\n\n\"You need to be prepared to take risks and he's happy to do that, and he backs himself that he's got the power game when the field is out.\n\n\"No [criticism of] guys that have been before, they've done great jobs for us, but we identified that it was an area where we wanted to add a little bit more punch.\"\n\nOf Atkinson, who took 22 wickets across the three matches, McCullum added: \"He's such a quiet man. He‚Äôs got inner confidence and a real confidence in his ability and skills.\n\n\"He's moved the ball off the seam both ways, hits great lengths, bowled high pace and committed to the bouncer plan and done what the captain asked and sustained it.\n\n\"He's been outstanding and he's quite cheeky within the group too and the guys love him.\"\n\nCaptain Stokes, meanwhile, also took on a starring role in the final Test, as he plundered England's quickest Test half-century, knocking off 50 in just 28 balls.",

They won five of their seven matches in the league stage and finished at the top of the table. They went on to win the Qualifier against the San Francisco Unicorns and make it to the summit clash of the tournament.\n\nThe Steve Smith-led team has played all-round cricket so far. While Steve Smith and Travis Head have been giving them great starts at the top of the innings, bowlers like Saurabh Netravalkar and Lockie Ferguson have put them ahead in the games with their super efficient bowling. The team will be looking to do it one last time and become the second team to lay their hands on the coveted trophy.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns\n\nWhile the Washington Freedom have played the best cricket in the tournament, the San Francisco Unicorns have been a close second. While the Freedom have played all-round cricket, the Unicorns have been led well by their skipper Corey Anderson.\n\nFinn Allenn has given them great starts at the top of the order and for the majority of the tournament was aided by the presence of Matt Short. The Aussie top-order batter however as went away to play The Hundred and will not be available for this game. So, the onus will be on Allen to give them a significant start. However, players like Hassan Khan and Sanjay Krishnamurthi have stepped in the last couple of games. As far as the bowling efforts are concerned, it has been a team effort and they would be hoping to do it one last time.\n\nWAS vs SF: Match Details & Live Streaming\n\nWAS vs SF: Grand Prairie Stadium Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at the Grand Prairie Stadium has been a sporty one. While the batters have enjoyed playing stroke against the hard and new ball, the bowlers have had to use their variations to be successful here. There will be help for the spinners throughout the game but the pacers will come into the game towards the death phases.\n\nWAS vs SF: Probable Playing XIs\n\nWashington Freedom: Travis Head, Steve Smith (c), Andries Gous, Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Maxwell, Mukhtar Ahmed, Obus Pienaar, Marco Jansen, Saurabh Netravalkar, Ian Holland, Lockie Ferguson\n\nSan Franciscon Unicorns: Finn Allen, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, Josh Inglis (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Hassan Khan, Corey Anderson (c), Pat Cummins, Haris Rauf, Carmi le Roux, Juanoy Drysdale\n\nWAS vs SF: Fantoss Fantasy Tips\n\nWicketkeeper: Josh Inglis\n\nBatters: Steve Smith, Travis Head, Finn Allen, Sanjay Krishnamurthi\n\nAll-rounders: Glenn Maxwell, Rachin Ravindra, Hassan Khan\n\nBowlers: Lockie Ferguson, Saurabh Netravalkar, Carmi le Roux\n\nCaptain: Steve Smith\n\nVice-captain: Travis Head\n\nWAS vs SF: Winner Prediction\n\nThe Washington Freedom have played great cricket in the tournament.

    "body": "Good Saturday morning! I hope those of you in the U.S. are enjoying a long, peaceful holiday weekend. And hopefully your neighborhood is quieter than mine was last night. Enough with the fireworks already!! I‚Äôm going to be up early and on the road today, then this evening I have to fill in for someone at my other job. I‚Äôll try to monitor the comments as best as I can, when I have time and good reception.\n\nNow then, let‚Äôs welcome back Major League Cricket for its second season. Last year I did a uni review for the inaugural kits. It includes a brief explanation of what T-20 cricket is, and why this league genuinely deserves to be called ‚ÄúMajor,‚Äù so if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the sport, do give that a look. Last night, Season Two opened with a couple of games‚Ä¶ one in Morrisville, North Carolina and the other in Grand Prairie, Texas. The first matchup featured the defending champion MI New York‚Ä¶\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n‚Ä¶taking on the Seattle Orcas.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nMI NY (the MI stands for Mumbai Indians, the Indian Premier League franchise that runs this team) made some tweaks from last year‚Äôs uni, dropping the dark pants stripe in favor of a thin gold stripe that also crosses the backside, and changing the tinsel-y side panels to a diamond pattern. The one thing they DESPERATELY needed to drop was those shiny gold numbers that the parent club is so fond of wearing. Yeah, in the right light *and* at the right angle they look fine.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nBut as you saw in the first photo, they can be illegible even in the same lighting. Such a shame, because with regular gold numbers, this could be a really good uni. I especially like the‚Ä¶I guess that‚Äôs an art deco sublimation on the jerseys.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nSeattle looks pretty much the same from last year‚Äôs kit.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nI will be saying that for some other teams as well, and when I do I realize some of them have different ads on the jerseys and/or pants. I don‚Äôt care about that. I‚Äôm trying my best to ignore the ads and enjoy the cricket. So glad the Orcas logo remains on the batting helmets. That‚Äôs my favorite logo from the whole league.\n\nThe second game featured the Texas Super Kings hosting the LA Knight Riders in a vibrant matchup.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nLA really toned down the gold sublimation this year as opposed to last season. The purple seems toned down as well. I would have kept that the same, but overall I like this version better. Also, I really REALLY like bowler Ali Khan‚Äôs jersey!\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nIt‚Äôs always nice to see when players are allowed to opt out of wearing the jersey ad. LA‚Äôs main advertiser is a betting site out of Bangladesh. I wouldn‚Äôt wear that either. You can get a better look at Ali Khan and both team‚Äôs unis in this video of him taking three of his four wickets‚Ä¶one of them thanks to a great barehanded catch by Derone Davis.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nI‚Äôm usually not one for a lot of technology in sports, but I do love those light-up stumps. I also love how LA Gets It with their use of gold. Yes, the helmets and pads are a little shiny, but not in a reflective way.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nThe numbers, as you saw in the video, are just right. Meanwhile, Texas seems the same as last year. I liked it then and I like it now.\n\nThat leaves two teams that haven‚Äôt played yet. The Washington Freedom looks the same in the lede photo as they did last season, while the San Francisco Unicorns appear to have dropped their contrasting blue sleeves in favor of a more orange jersey. I‚Äôm calling this a downgrade, but we‚Äôll see how it looks once they actually take the field today. Here‚Äôs a closer look of all the new uniforms.\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nThe reason I said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt blink‚Äù in the headline is because while most T-20 leagues play for roughly two months, Major League Cricket is played completely in the month of July. For now. Each of the six teams play seven regular season games, half of what is played in the IPL. It‚Äôs almost the same length as the Caribbean Premier League, which starts at the end of August and ends in the first week of October. So enjoy all the MLC action while you can!",

Now, despite changing to US citizenship, Chand was left out of the USA squad that shocked everyone and reached the Super 8 of the 2024 T20 World Cup. However, Chand, 31, has a point to prove, and started off the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC) - USA's franchise T20 league - with a swashbuckling half-century.\n\nInterestingly, Chand's present MLC franchise is Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), who are owned by the Knight Riders group. Many might remember that Chand's downfall started when he was famously clean bowled by Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Brett Lee in the opening ball of IPL 2013.\n\nAfter finishing bottom of the table in the first season of MLC last year, LAKR required a strong start to MLC 2024. Chand, coming in to bat at no. 3, took charge in the opening match against Texas Super Kings, after openers Jason Roy and Sunil Narine had been dismissed for two runs each.\n\nChand made 68 off 45 balls, hitting six 4s and three 6s. No other batter in the LAKR lineup crossed 30, and only one crossed 20. It was Chand's effort that took LAKR to a respectable total of 162/7.\n\nStar names like David Miller and Andre Russell failed to score big as well. Russell only made 10, while Miller was out for four after his T20 World Cup final heartbreak.\n\nIn response, Texas Super Kings (TSK) fell short by 12 runs. Frontline USA pacer Ali Khan dismantled the TSK middle order, picking up three wickets, that saw TSK lose four wickets in five balls between the 14th and 15th over.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders next play San Francisco Unicorns on July 8.",

The top order struggled and kept losing wickets in regular succession. Trent Boult picked up a couple of early wickets and put Seattle Orcas under a lot of pressure. With their key batters gone, Orcas went into more trouble after Rashid Khan removed their premier batter Heinrich Klaasen. Harmeet Singh hit a couple of boundaries but he too got out at a wrong time and Orcas were eventually bowled out for 108.\n\nDuring the chase, MI New York also started off badly. They could barely score any runs in the Powerplay overs, while losing both their openers. After this phase, Nicholas Pooran took the responsibility of taking MI New York over the line. He smashed 62 runs in 37 balls, stayed not out and took MI New York home with 6 wickets in hand.\n\nCurrent Form Washington Freedom:\n\nWashington Freedom played well in the previous edition of the Major League Cricket. They reached the Playoffs but lost to MI New York in the Eliminator match to get knocked out.\n\nThe top run scorer for Washington Freedom in the previous edition was Matthew Short with 152 runs to his name.\n\nThe top wicket taker for Washington Freedom in the previous edition was Saurabh Netravalkar with 10 scalps under his belt.\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup hero for USA, Saurabh Netravalkar is a part of the Washington Freedom squad.

Washington Freedom have a great chance to win the Major League Cricket 2024 title.\n\nPlayers to look out for:\n\n1. Andries Gous - He performed like a champion in the recently concluded ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Gous can hit the ball a long way and he is expected to be Washington Freedom's best batter this season.\n\n2. Lockie Ferguson- He looked in great touch in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, despite New Zealand getting knocked out in the first round.

Washington Freedom captain Steve Smith won the toss and elected to field first.\n\nThe decision proved to be wise as USA's rising cricket star Saurabh Netravalkar spearheaded the bowling attack with a superb performance. Netravalkar, named 'Player of the Match,' delivered an impressive spell, claiming 3 wickets for just 24 runs.\n\nHe was well-supported by fellow pacer Justin Dill, who also took 3 wickets, conceding 33 runs. The pair ensured that MI New York's batting line-up never found stability, with wickets falling at regular intervals.\n\nDespite the regular fall of wickets, West Indies power-hitter Nicholas Pooran showcased his batting prowess with a rapid 44 off 30 balls, keeping the scoreboard ticking. Contributions from Afghanistan all-rounder Rashid Khan, who scored a quickfire 31 off 15 balls, and South African fast bowler Anrich Nortje, with 14 off 9 balls, helped MI New York reach a respectable total of 154 for 9 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nChasing a target of 155 with rain clouds threatening, Washington Freedom's innings got off to a shaky start. Australian World Cup winner Travis Head fell early for just 1 run in the second over.\n\nHowever, Steve Smith, who opened the innings with Head, anchored the chase with a measured yet aggressive approach. Smith played a captain's knock, scoring an unbeaten 46 off 28 balls, including 4 fours and 3 sixes. His steady presence at the crease was complemented by Andries Gous, who supported well from the other end.\n\nAs Washington reached 55 for 1 in 7.4 overs, play was halted due to lightning, followed by rain, which prevented any further action. With no resumption in sight, the match officials resorted to the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method to determine the result.

Despite Nicholas Pooran's valiant effort, scoring a 30-ball 44, New York faced consistent setbacks with regular loss of wickets. Opener Ruben Clinton (28) gave his team a strong platform with a good start, but the introduction of Glenn Maxwell proved lethal as he was bowled while attempting a reverse sweep.\n\nWith Monank Patel (5) and Shayan Jahangir (6) having lost their wickets, all eyes were on Pooran, who found the regular boundaries.

    "body": "MI New York: In a rain-marred third match of the ongoing Major League Cricket 2024 at the Church Street Park in Morrisville, Washington Freedom prevailed over MI New York by four runs via the DLS Method.\n\nThe match was a tightly contested one. In the second innings, Washington Freedom faced an early setback with the dismissal of Travis Head (1). Steve Smith initially took a couple of overs to settle in, but once he found his rhythm and struck his first boundary on his seventh ball, the New York bowlers struggled to contain him. The Australian star batter smashed four fours and three sixes, racing to an impressive 46* off 28 balls.\n\nWith 7.4 overs of the Washington Freedom innings done, the match took a turn for the worse as rain and lighting brought on the covers. However, Smith‚Äôs power-hitting in the final over of the powerplay took them ahead on DLS with a score of 55/1. In the end, that proved enough to seal the match as rain played spoilsport.\n\nTrending\n\nEarlier in the day, the MI New York struggled to score freely against a disciplined bowling attack after being put into bat first. Despite Nicholas Pooran's valiant effort, scoring a 30-ball 44, New York faced consistent setbacks with regular loss of wickets.\n\nOpener Ruben Clinton (28) gave his team a strong platform with a good start, but the introduction of Glenn Maxwell proved lethal as he was bowled while attempting a reverse sweep.\n\nWith Monank Patel (5) and Shayan Jahangir (6) having lost their wickets, all eyes were on Pooran, who found the regular boundaries. Despite the wickets falling at the other end, Pooran kept the pressure on the Washington Freedom bowlers.\n\nLockie Ferguson was the breakthrough bowler for MI New York, as Pooran‚Äôs mistimed shot fell to Glenn Maxwell. Eventually, Pooran was aided by a crucial cameo from Rashid Khan, who smashed 31 off 15, and some valuable boundaries from Anrich Nortje (14), which propelled them to 154.\n\nWith Monank Patel (5) and Shayan Jahangir (6) having lost their wickets, all eyes were on Pooran, who found the regular boundaries.

In reply, the New York side got an early breakthrough and it was Pooran who had to be credited for an outstanding catch.\n\nAfter a three-run first over, Ehsan Adil bowled a good length delivery outside the off stump to Head. The southpaw intended to execute a drive on that but played inside the line and got the outside edge toward the left of the gloveman. Pooran was excellent with his reflex as he leaped to his left and grasped the white cherry with his left-hand to complete a stunner.

As they begin a fresh campaign against the same team, Washington will be eager to exact revenge.\n\nThe franchise has made wholesale changes to its squad, especially when it comes to international players, with Akeal Hosein and Marco Jansen being the only ones retained. The biggest names are undoubtedly the Aussie trio of Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head.\n\nThey add plenty of firepower to the top and middle order, and Freedom will be looking towards a big total if any one of them gets going.

However, as they play their second match in less than 24 hours, New York must keep their momentum going.\n\nNicholas Pooran was once again in top form as he smashed an unbeaten half-century to help his team chase down a modest target quite easily. He, along with Shayan Jahangir, and Steven Taylor makes up for a strong middle order. New York is also likely to avail the services of Tim David and Kieron Pollard as all-rounders.\n\nNew York boasts one of the strongest and well-balanced bowling units in the league.\n\nTrent Boult, Ehsan Adil, and Anrich Nortje are the 3 quality seamers on the team who picked up 5 wickets between them on Friday.

    "body": "The Stateside cricket fever continues as the new Major League Cricket season is here to fill the void after the T20I World Cup. After a successful first season, the franchise cricket league is set to return with even more flair. ICC has granted List A accreditation to the competition, so it will be able to attract more star power from around the world. Who will win the second edition of Major League Cricket? Join us for our exclusive 2024 MLC predictions and tips.\n\nMLC 2024: Cricket Event Details\n\nSome of the team crests and names might make you think that Major League Cricket is the US expansion of the Indian Premier League. While the competition has a strong connection to the IPL, MLC is attempting to carve its own identity into the vast and diverse sporting landscape of the US.\n\nSix teams return to battle it out for the MLC title, just like last season, to grab the attention of the best cricket World Cup bookies. All the action unfolds at the familiar Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park, with matches running from 5th to 28th of July. Get ready to see some of the world‚Äôs biggest T20 stars lighting up the American cricket scene with their world-class finesse.\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è Tournament: 2024 Major League Cricket, T20 Cricket Tournament üìù Format: Round-robin system with playoffs üèè Venues: Grand Prairie Stadium, Grand Prairie, Nashville, Tennessee üóìÔ∏è Dates: Friday, 5 July to Sunday, 28 July, 2024\n\nMI New York @ 3.25 (9/4)\n\nNew York edged into the playoffs last year, then turned on the afterburners, thanks to a fiery batting display by Dewald Brevis and Nicholas Pooran. The latter, in particular, was unstoppable in the final, smashing an unbeaten 137 to secure the MLC title for New York. With a bowling attack boasting Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Trent Boult, and the ever-reliable Kieron Pollard, they‚Äôll be firm favorites to defend their crown. What do we think of them in our 2024 MLC season predictions? We‚Äôll find out later.\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns @ 4.60 (18/5)\n\nThe Unicorns‚Äô 2023 season was a heartbreaker. Despite only managing two wins, they were agonizingly edged out of the playoffs by the eventual champions, MI New York, on net run rate. But they haven‚Äôt sat still. They‚Äôve brought in some exciting new talent, so expect a much stronger showing this year. Could they be a real threat to make the playoffs? Those who bet on MLC 2024 online believe they can.\n\nWashington Freedom @ 7.00 (6/1)\n\nWith a lineup packed with big hitters like the in-form South African Andries Gous, fresh off his World Cup heroics, and the established duo of Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head, they have the firepower to go all the way. Their bowling attack is a force to be reckoned with, too, boasting the pace of Kiwi Lockie Ferguson and the spin wizardry of South Africa‚Äôs Marco Jansen. Make bets safe but entertaining while placing your punt on Washington making the playoffs.\n\nSeattle Orcas @ 7.00 (6/1)\n\nAfter dominating the group stage with four wins out of five, they went on a tear through the Eliminator and Challenger, only to fall short in the final. Given the quality of the Orcas squad, many 2024 MLC predictions will see them making a deep run in the tournament once again. With two world-class hitters like Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen leading the charge and a bolstered bowling attack thanks to the draft, the Seattle side will look to nail down the title that narrowly escaped them last year.\n\nMI New York to Win Outright @ 3.25 (9/4)\n\nMain Prediction\n\nMI New York to Win Outright\n\nBest odds:\n\n3.25 (9/4)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n2 (100%)\n\n0\n\nMI New York took their time to get going last season, but they could turn up the heat much earlier this season. According to the 2024 Major League Cricket odds, Nicholas Pooran and company are the frontrunners in the title race. After taking a deep look into their squad, we are convinced that they have the best chance as well.\n\nMI New York boasts a terrifying pace attack this season, spearheaded by the lethal trio of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, and Anrich Nortje. Together, these world-class fast bowlers can dismantle any batting lineup in the tournament.\n\nComplementing their fearsome pace attack, MI New York has a crafty spin duo that will make life difficult for opposing batsmen. The legendary Rashid Khan leads the spin department, with rising star Nosthush Kenjige providing support.\n\nNicholas Pooran, Dewald Brevis, Kieron Pollard, and Tim David are a nightmare to face for any bowling attack. These hard hitters can single-handedly change the game‚Äôs momentum with their explosive batting.\n\nBut MI New York‚Äôs batting depth doesn‚Äôt stop there. Players like Monank Patel, Rashid Khan, and Romario Shepherd offer valuable flexibility, providing the right mix of power and stability depending on the situation and pitch.\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders and MI New York to Play the Final @ 5.00 (4/1)\n\nRisky Bet\n\nLos Angeles Knight Riders and MI New York to Play the Final\n\nBest odds:\n\n5.00 (4/1)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n1 (50%)\n\n(50%) 1\n\nWe are rooting for the Los Angeles Knight Riders to have a strong season this time around following their horror debut campaign.\n\nSeasoned T20 veterans like Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, and Shakib Al Hasan bring both dynamism and depth to the squad. Their extensive experience is a valuable asset, and the team will undoubtedly be leaning on these three stalwarts to significantly improve upon their last-place finish from the previous season.\n\nWe believe the 2024 Los Angeles Knight Riders squad has what it takes to make a grand final run, but MI New York might be too overpowering for them in the final.\n\nTravis Head Highest Run Scorer @ 7.50 (13/2)\n\nRisky Bet\n\nTravis Head Highest Run Scorer\n\nBest odds:\n\n7.50 (13/2)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n2 (100%)\n\n0\n\nFueled by Travis Head‚Äôs explosive batting, the Washington Freedom have a strong chance to make a deep run in the tournament. While a championship victory might be out of reach, they could become a real force to be reckoned with, with Head leading the charge.\n\nThe Aussie opener has shown excellent T20 form this year. He was one of the Orange Cap contenders in the IPL with 567 runs to his name in 15 innings. For his country, he has returned 255 runs in seven appearances.\n\nFresh off his T20 World Cup experience in the Americas, the left-handed batsman appears primed to dominate the MLC scoring charts.\n\nTrent Boult Highest Wicket Taker @ 11.00 (10/1)\n\nRisky Bet\n\nTrent Boult Highest Wicket Taker\n\nBest odds:\n\n11.00 (10/1)\n\nAgree with prediction?\n\n(2 voted)\n\n1 (50%)\n\n(50%) 1\n\nTrent Boult was instrumental in MI New York‚Äôs historic campaign last year. The Kiwi paceman bagged a staggering 22 wickets, twice the number of his closest competitor.\n\nOver the years, Boult has established himself as one of the most lethal bowlers in T20 cricket. He has been particularly effective during power-play overs. With an excellent ability to swing the ball with incredible pace, Boult will be back to terrorize the batters once again in MI New York colors.\n\nThe recently retired New Zealand pacer hunted down nine wickets in four appearances for his country this year before hanging up his Black Caps kit. He also claimed 15 wickets in the 2024 IPL season. Everything points toward another sensational MLC campaign for the 34-year-old.",
    "summary": "**Tournament Details:**\n\n* The second season of MLC will take place from July 5 to July 28, 2024.\n* Six teams will participate in the tournament, which will be played in a round-robin format followed by playoffs.\n* The matches will be held at two venues: Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park.\n\n**Teams and Predictions:**\n\n* MI New York is the defending champion and is favored to win again, with odds of 3.25 (9/4).\n* San Francisco Unicorns, who were edged out of the playoffs last season, are expected to make a stronger showing this year.\n* Washington Freedom has a strong lineup with big hitters like Andries Gous, Glenn Maxwell, and Travis Head, and are expected to make a deep run in the tournament.\n* Seattle Orcas, who lost in the final last season, have a strong squad and are predicted to make a deep run again.\n* Los Angeles Knight Riders, who had a poor debut campaign, are expected to have a strong season with the addition of experienced T20 veterans like Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, and Shakib Al Hasan.\n\n**Player Predictions:**\n\n* Nicholas Pooran and Dewald Brevis are expected to lead MI New York's batting charge.\n* Travis Head is predicted to be the highest run-scorer in the tournament, with odds of 7.50 (13/2).\n* Trent Boult is expected to be the highest wicket-taker in the tournament, with odds of 11.00 (10/1).",

Playing for San Francisco Unicorns, Rauf picked up four wickets in nine games.\n\nComing back to the 2022 T20 World Cup, India and Pakistan had a thrilling matchup that went right down to the wire and saw Virat Kohli play one of the greatest knocks in T20I history.

The fan was heard saying, \"Melbourne abhi bhi yaad aata hai? Virat ke 2 chakke\" (Do you remember Melbourne, Virat's 2 sixes). Responding to this, an annoyed Rauf just nodded his head and said yes.\n\nSpeaking about those sixes, Haris Rauf complimented Virat Kohli and described him as the only batter who can hit those shots. Rauf said, \"The way he [Kohli] played in the World Cup, that is his class, we all know the types of shots he plays. And the way he hit those sixes, I don't think any other player can hit a shot like that off my bowling.

    "date": "Thu Aug  1 10:51:02 2024",
    "body": "Cricket\n\n-OneArabia\n\nBy OneArabia\n\nFinn Allen, the New Zealand international cricketer, made headlines with his impressive performance in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024. The 25-year-old opener showcased his aggressive batting style, catching the attention of many cricket enthusiasts.\n\nDespite his remarkable performance in MLC 2024, where he scored 306 runs in nine matches at an average of 34, Allen did not attract any bids at the IPL 2024 auction. He had registered for the auction with a base price of INR 75 lakh. His strike rate of 187.73 was the highest in the tournament, making him a valuable asset for any T20 team.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad could greatly benefit from Allen's batting prowess. Known for their aggressive approach last season, which led to record-breaking totals, the Sunrisers might be keen to sign him. His ability to accelerate scoring could be a perfect fit for their strategy.\n\nThe Chennai Super Kings (CSK), five-time IPL champions, might also show interest in Allen. Their previous signing of Rachin Ravindra for INR 1.8 crore did not yield expected results as he struggled as an opener. CSK might consider offloading Ravindra and bringing in Allen to strengthen their lineup and improve their chances in powerplay overs.\n\nGujarat Titans, who won the IPL trophy in their debut season in 2022 but failed to qualify for playoffs in 2024, might look to sign quality players like Finn Allen. Adding him to their squad could enhance their performance and help them dominate future seasons.\n\nAllen's performance in MLC 2024 has undoubtedly strengthened his resume as an aggressive batter. Although he did not secure a spot in IPL 2024, his skills make him a sought-after player for upcoming auctions. Teams looking to boost their batting lineup will likely consider him a valuable addition.\n\nIn summary, Finn Allen's explosive batting style makes him an attractive option for several IPL teams. Sunrisers Hyderabad, Chennai Super Kings, and Gujarat Titans are among those who might pursue him in future auctions to bolster their squads and improve their chances of success.\n\nStory first published: Thursday, August 1, 2024, 10:51 [GST]",

    "body": "Photo Credit: Instagram Photo of @gavaskarsunilofficial\n\nFormer Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has raised serious concerns following the conclusion of Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024). The Washington Freedom won the tournament, defeating the San Francisco Unicorns in the final at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nGavaskar, who was in the US as part of the broadcast team, witnessed drastic changes in MLC 2024. Despite featuring several international stars, he expressed disappointment over the league‚Äôs overall quality.\n\nThe former Indian captain noted a significant decline in MLC‚Äôs standards compared to its inaugural season and pointed out the poor crowd turnout for MLC 2024, which contrasted sharply with the enthusiastic attendance in the first edition.\n\nGavaskar has suggested a major overhaul to restore the tournament‚Äôs prestige, including imposing restrictions on players‚Äô participation in other franchise T20 leagues to ensure higher competitive cricket and deliver world-class entertainment to fans.\n\nSunil Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar: ‚ÄúFor some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual.‚Äù\n\nGavaskar suggested limiting players to three T20 leagues worldwide to maintain high standards and competitiveness. He emphasized the IPL as the top league and recommended players choose two other leagues to participate in.\n\nHe added, ‚ÄúWhile nobody wants the players‚Äô source of income to be curbed, I feel it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in three leagues of their choice. The IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So, the player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice.‚Äù\n\nGavaskar explained that players often compete for one IPL team while representing rival IPL teams in other T20 leagues. This is understandable if their IPL team isn‚Äôt in those leagues, but it‚Äôs odd to see players in rival IPL jerseys elsewhere.",

This decision was made to effectively manage his workload and provide him with an opportunity to focus on his physical conditioning in anticipation of a demanding summer ahead.\n\n\"Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it,\" Cummins told Fox Sports. \"I've basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, then you start building up again for the summer.\n\n\"It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, makes you less susceptible to injuries,\" he added.\n\nOver the past year, Cummins has had a hectic schedule. His engagements included an ODI series against India, the successful ODI World Cup campaign, three Test matches against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour in New Zealand, two Test matches against New Zealand, the Indian Premier League, the T20 World Cup held in the Caribbean, and the MLC tournament.\n\n\"I'm very sore today after a week of gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can't really nail it while you're in the midst of the season,\" the 31-year-old said.\n\n\"I'll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can't really fit in the middle of the season.\"\n\nThe upcoming edition of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy will feature five Test matches. Australia hav been unable to secure the trophy since 2017, as India have emerged victorious in four consecutive series. This includes their remarkable successes in Australia during the 2018-19 and 2020-21 tours.\n\nAs the captain, Cummins is determined to lead his team to victory and claim the trophy on home soil this season.\n\n\"It's the trophy I haven't won before... this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven't ticked off,\" Cummins said.\n\n\"We've achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\n\"That's what lies ahead of us this summer. They (India) are a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" he added.\n\nCummins has no intention of retiring from T20 cricket in the near future. He aspires to contribute to Australia's quest for the gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, which will feature cricket for the first time in the history of the quadrennial event.\n\n\"Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle,\" Cummins said. \"I'd love to be on that side (at LA 2028). I think I'll be 35 or something, so hopefully still there or thereabouts.\n\n\"Honestly, right now, it feels a long way away. Maybe once we get closer and start building into it, everyone gets a bit more excited,\" he concluded.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nKarisma Kapoor's look in a ruched dress will surely inspire you to go green this monsoon\n\nLifestyle\n\nHow to make Cheesy Garlic Bread Sticks with Pizza Base\n\nFood\n\nNazriya Nazim rocks a new short hair look\n\nEntertainment\n\nShruti Haasan dazzles as a fashion diva in every look\n\nEntertainment\n\n10 types of potatoes in India and which is the best\n\nFood\n\n‚ÄãHow to instill honesty in your child‚Äã\n\nLifestyle\n\nStunning off-screen appearances of 'Thiruchitrambalam' actress Nithya Menen\n\nEntertainment\n\nKanika Mann‚Äôs delightful desi looks\n\ntv\n\nAditi Shankar revolutionises ethnic fashion\n\nEntertainment",

During India‚Äôs last tour of Australia in 2020/21, the visitors staged a remarkable comeback. After a humiliating start in Adelaide, where India was bowled out for a mere 36 in the day/night Test, the series seemed headed for disaster.\n\nHowever, despite losing key players, including then-captain Virat Kohli, and fielding a makeshift bowling attack in the final Test, India clinched a 2-1 series victory.\n\nThe crowning achievement came at the Gabba, a venue where Australia had remained unbeaten since 1989.\n\nCummins, who was part of the Australian squad during that series, is determined to change the outcome this time around. \"They're a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" Cummins remarked.",

The Major League Cricket (MLC), the first T20 franchise league in the country which boasts of several journeyman stars, got underway in Dallas on Thursday, July 13, while in August, a set of marquee Indian names headlined by Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh will be seen in action in Raleigh, North Carolina for the US Masters T10 League.\n\nPlaying catch-up will be neighbours Canada, who are going to revive their Global T20 Canada from July 20 after a gap of three years.

The trio of India‚Äôs 2011 World Cup winning squad ‚Äì Gambhir, Yuvraj and Yusuf Pathan will turn out for New Jersey Legends there while there will be other big Indian names who have recently retired from international cricket.\n\nHere are a few samplers: Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan and Mohammed Kaif will play for California Knights; Harbhajan Singh, Parthiv Patel for Morrisville Unity; Robin Uthappa for Atlanta Fire; Munaf Patel for New York Warriors.

    "date": "Wed Jul 31 12:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Australian bowler Pat Cummins made his debut in Major League Cricket‚Äôs second season, which wrapped July 28. The international star, whom Wisden, the English cricketing bible, lists as the leading player in the world, is one of the few athletes with such a broad skill set that he can excel at all three of the sport‚Äôs codes: five-day Test matches, one-day games, and the three-hour Twenty20 format played in MLC.\n\nCummins, like many of the game‚Äôs best, has his pick of any league, and can set his own schedule; he has recently limited his appearances to international matches for Australia and a roughly $2.4 million annual deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League (IPL)‚Äîby far the highest-quality and best-paid T20 league in the world.\n\nIn recent years Cummins has shunned playing in any of the other national T20 competitions that litter the cricket calendar. He has not even competed in the Australian tournament, known as the Big Bash, since 2017. That‚Äôs why Cummins‚Äôs two-year deal to play for the San Francisco Unicorns was a particular coup for MLC‚Äîa relatively small U.S. league with a draw that pales in comparison to overseas leagues, based in a country that still lacks international-standard facilities. His agreement with MLC, inked in June, saw Cummins play in the U.S. before any of MLC‚Äôs closest rivals, such as The Hundred in England or SA20 in South Africa.\n\nHe‚Äôs just one of the many outstanding overseas cricketers who have landed in the U.S. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ecstatic with the international players we signed up,‚Äù says Justin Geale, tournament director of Major League Cricket. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got some of the best players in the world.‚Äù\n\nTalent keeps trickling in from overseas leagues in part because MLC can lay out cash‚Äîand other opportunities‚Äîin a way some overseas leagues simply can‚Äôt. Even as a start-up league in a sport where salaries are relatively low, international stars defecting to the U.S. are finding themselves with paydays that spell earnings they never would have gotten in even some of the world‚Äôs biggest leagues.\n\nCricket rosters in the U.S. are increasingly loaded. Cummins (below) joined other outstanding overseas cricketers, including Trinidadian all-rounder Kieron Pollard and South African wicket-keeper batsman Heinrich Klaasen.\n\nThis year, the league has also attracted three key Australians: Steve Smith, a former national team captain; young batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk; and Travis Head, the star of the recent T20 World Cup held in the U.S. and the Caribbean. Add New Zealand‚Äôs Rachin Ravindra and South Africa‚Äôs Kagiso Rabada, and the MLC has jumped ahead of its rivals‚ÄîThe Hundred, in particular‚Äîin the race for talent.\n\nIt‚Äôs extraordinary that athletes favored the second season of a cricket competition in the U.S. ahead of a tournament held in England, the sport‚Äôs historic home. But money talks.\n\nGeale tells Front Office Sports that each of MLC‚Äôs six teams has a cap of $1.15 million to hire a squad of between 15 and 18 players. Of this total, $320,000 can be spent on domestic cricketers and $830,000 on up to nine overseas stars. (This is pocket change compared with the wages on offer in the IPL, but noteworthy relative to everywhere else.)\n\nAt the draft for domestic players, first-round picks earned $75,000‚Äîbut international stars have the potential to earn much more. For example, the Unicorns maxed out their allocation of overseas players in 2024, so if each of the other eight earned the same as the top-earning domestic players, the team would have $230,000 left for Cummins. Exact figures aren‚Äôt disclosed, but for the highest-shelf players who will certainly command more than the best domestic players, their earnings for this short stint are highly competitive with‚Äîoften better than‚ÄîThe Hundred, where the top salary band for domestic and international players is ¬£125,000 (around $160,000).\n\nThese paychecks have left other leagues scrambling. The fourth season of The Hundred, which began July 23, was missing around half of its overseas players because they were involved in MLC. For this year, MLC‚Äôs fixture list overlaps with The Hundred by six days. This has forced English franchises to rush to sign players on one-match deals to cover those players still involved in the U.S.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here to destroy world cricket,‚Äù Geale says. ‚ÄúBut for a long time, England has had that summer window to itself by virtue of being in a different hemisphere. If you look at the English winter, you have Australia, South Africa, and India all competing in that space. So, I think some competition [for players] in the summer was inevitable.‚Äù\n\nMLC also made an important strategic decision early on that has helped it to draw in overseas players. Before its debut season in 2023, it accepted investment from four of the Indian enterprises that run teams in the IPL. This brought in considerable operational experience, but also demystified MLC for some of the players the league was seeking to attract.\n\n‚ÄúThe players had preexisting relationships with owners, coaches, and support staff, so they could immediately feel comfortable in what is essentially a new tournament,‚Äù explains Dan Weston, an English cricket consultant who has worked with franchise teams in The Hundred and the IPL. The New York franchise, which is run by the same operation as the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, includes three overseas players‚ÄîTim David of Australia, Dewald Brevis of South Africa, and Romario Shepherd of the West Indies‚Äîwho play for Mumbai in India.\n\nMLC has been so successful in luring international talent that The Hundred is likely to make changes to catch up.\n\nThe Hundred‚Äôs eight teams are currently owned and operated by the England and Wales Cricket Board. This decision means the ECB has complete operational control over the tournament. The ECB also receives all of The Hundred‚Äôs revenue. However, this model also puts a ceiling on salaries and prevents the sort of international links that have brought foreign stars to MLC.\n\nThe ECB has secured the approval of the English domestic teams to sell 49% stakes in all Hundred franchises to private investors later this year. Although the ECB has spoken of investing proceeds from the sales into the domestic game and recreational cricket, its major goal is to prevent The Hundred from being outflanked by other competitions, including MLC. An ECB spokesman told FOS, ‚ÄúThe global cricketing landscape is highly competitive and that is why we are working to ensure we can attract the best overseas players along with retaining the best English talent.‚Äù\n\nThat the ECB is playing catchup to a nascent U.S. league is remarkable. ‚ÄúWe certainly have not taken first-mover advantage on private investment,‚Äù admitted the ECB‚Äôs chief executive, Richard Gould, in a recent interview with The Cricketer. Weston, meanwhile, believes the arrival of private investment would enable the ECB to raise salaries ‚Äúmarkedly,‚Äù eroding MLC‚Äôs current superiority.\n\nYet for all the effort, other leagues may struggle to replicate some of the factors that help MLC draw in overseas stars.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of the guys see opportunities off the field, as well for their post-cricket careers,‚Äù Geale tells FOS. ‚ÄúThere is a certain fascination about the American sports market. It is incredibly sophisticated. The brands are big, and they do it really well.‚Äù\n\nWhen announcing his deal with the Unicorns, Cummins noted the ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù appeal of building links to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Cricket does not yet have the culture of veteran players investing in sports properties, but it is possible that Cummins‚Äôs generation could take the first exploratory steps.\n\nAnd even without players without strategic plans, a month in the States is simply an enjoyable time. ‚ÄúEveryone wants to go to the U.S. and see the country,‚Äù says Cameron Gannon, an Australian-born bowler who has played in both seasons of MLC. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge tourist destination, and the league is a great way to make that happen.‚Äù\n\nAs they jostle for the sport‚Äôs best players, both MLC and The Hundred have expansion plans. Geale says MLC wants to add another two teams in 2026 and even more beyond that, provided it can build some more grounds to host matches. And across the pond, part of the ECB‚Äôs pitch to its potential investors is the opportunity to add more games to its fixture list.\n\nAlthough Geale believes ‚Äúthere is no reason why MLC and The Hundred cannot live nicely together,‚Äù future schedule clashes seem likely, necessitating that the leagues will continue to go head-to-head to host the world‚Äôs best players.\n\nAs for Cummins, the Unicorns were well beaten in Sunday‚Äôs final by Washington Freedom. Nevertheless, the Aussie skipper took the wickets of countrymen Head and Smith and smote two big sixes in a batting cameo of 13 runs off seven balls. A runners-up spot for Cummins and the chance to learn from one of the best players in the game means that both player and team will consider his contract to be money well spent.",
    "summary": "**Debut of Pat Cummins and Overseas Stars**: Australian bowler Pat Cummins made his debut in MLC's second season, which concluded on July 28. Cummins, one of the world's top cricketers, is part of a growing list of international stars who have joined MLC, including Kieron Pollard, Heinrich Klaasen, Steve Smith, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, and Kagiso Rabada.\n\n**Talent Acquisition**: MLC has outbid rival leagues, such as The Hundred in England, to attract top talent. The league's ability to offer competitive salaries, with each team having a $1.15 million cap, and its strategic partnership with Indian IPL teams have helped lure overseas players.\n\n**Salary Structure**: Each team has a $830,000 allocation for up to nine overseas players, with top stars potentially earning more than the top salary band of ¬£125,000 (around $160,000) in The Hundred.\n\n**Competition with The Hundred**: The success of MLC has forced The Hundred to make changes, with plans to sell 49% stakes in its teams to private investors to increase salaries and attract more international talent.\n\n**Expansion Plans**: MLC aims to add two more teams in 2026 and build more grounds to host matches, while The Hundred plans to expand its fixture list.\n\n**Future of the League**: The competition between MLC and The Hundred is expected to continue, with schedule clashes likely in the future. However, MLC's tournament director, Justin Geale, believes that both leagues can coexist and attract top talent.",

    "date": "Wed Jul 31 12:03:33 2024",
    "body": "As Major League Cricket (MLC) completed its second season in July 2024, the league has emerged as an exciting platform for international players while also posing a significant challenge: engaging local youth to ensure cricket‚Äôs long-term viability in the United States.\n\nOne of the standout moments this season was Oregon-born Sanjay Krishnamurthi, a 21-year-old computer science student, who hit the winning run for his San Francisco Unicorns, scoring 79 off 42 balls in a thrilling match against Washington Freedom on July 22. This victory not only marked Washington‚Äôs first loss of the season but also highlighted the potential for USA-born cricketers to enrich the local sports landscape, laying the groundwork for a vibrant future for cricket in America. Including talented local cricketers in MLC teams will be crucial for the league‚Äôs success in the coming years.\n\nHowever, what truly fills the stands at sports venues? It could be the electric atmosphere, the star power of elite athletes, or the intense rivalries that captivate fans. More importantly, fans‚Äô deep emotional bond with their teams keeps them returning. Take the Chicago Cubs in Baseball and their devoted supporters at Wrigley Field or the sold-out crowds cheering for Michael Jordan at the United Center. Currently, Major League Cricket operates with just two venues hosting six teams, which poses a challenge for fans looking to forge a personal connection with their teams. The absence of a home-and-away structure further complicates this relationship, leaving fans yearning for greater engagement and loyalty.\n\nREAD | A second coming for their second home in the T20 World Cup 2024\n\nBuilding that vital fan-team camaraderie remains an uphill battle. With two teams based in California and another in Washington, the lack of dedicated West Coast stadiums hampers local support development. Once the infrastructure is established, proper home-and-away matches can foster deeper connections. However, as the tournament continues to grow over the years, a positive momentum is building. Players are beginning to consider their long-term affiliations, such as Harmeet Singh, the left-arm spinner with roots in the Seattle franchise who has shown his commitment to the team coached by Pravin Amre.\n\nTake, for instance, Pat Cummins, the exceptional Australian bowler who recently signed a four-year deal with the San Francisco Unicorns, backed by tech entrepreneurs Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan. Cummins strategically aligns his passion for cricket with smart investments for his future, illustrating how players can merge their athletic careers with opportunities that pave the way for long-term success. The United States, often dubbed the land of opportunity, may represent the perfect paradigm for this new venture.\n\nSo far, six teams have participated in MLC‚Äôs first two seasons, with four teams from IPL franchises playing integral roles in team management. With the proposed expansion on the horizon, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before other IPL teams are interested in the newer MLC expansion teams.\n\nSanjay Parthasarathy, the operating partner and co-owner of the Seattle Orcas, shares his insights with Sportstar on what needs to happen for cricket to thrive in the USA: grassroots development in schools, colleges, and communities; a winning USA national team and appropriate infrastructure. He noted that the USA team‚Äôs success in reaching the Super 8 stages of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 has sparked heightened interest and awareness. The Seattle Orcas is actively investing in grassroots initiatives, emphasising, ‚ÄúBuilding a new location for cricket in the US will take a while. We are moving in the right trajectory with accelerated speed.‚Äù\n\nWhen asked about the potential for other IPL teams to join, he remarked, ‚ÄúThe first movers in the IPL moved quickly. Based on other T20 leagues, we should expect Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, and Lucknow Super Giants to show interest. All this will depend on the expansion of the MLC, which remains to be seen.‚Äù\n\nIn terms of cricket-related excitement, the league has not disappointed. The challenger match between Texas and San Francisco reached a thrilling climax when the Texas Super Kings needed 18 runs off the final over. It faced the formidable Pat Cummins, whose exceptional skill with yorkers proved decisive, ultimately humbling the Super Kings and securing a memorable victory to reach the finals of MLC season 2. While the cricketing entertainment factor has been abundant, the fervent support from loyal fans has been lacking, highlighting a critical area for growth in cultivating dedicated team followings. In the finals of the 2024 MLC, Washington Freedom was led by Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell to provide them with a thumping win over San Francisco Unicorns.\n\nForeign players have also capitalised on the opportunities presented by MLC. Pakistan‚Äôs young all-rounder Hassan Khan made the most of his chances this season, citing the benefits of playing in the league.",
    "summary": "The MLC has completed its second season, showcasing its potential as a platform for international players and highlighting the need to engage local youth to ensure cricket's long-term viability in the US.

The dynamic New Zealand opener set the tournament on fire by playing with intent.\n\nThe 25-year-old who played for San Fransisco Unicorns, finished MLC 2024 as the fourth-highest leading run-getter with 306 runs in nine games at an average of 34, including 1 century and 2 fifties. Moreover, he maintained a sensational strike rate of 187.73, the most by a batter in the tournament. He hasn't played in the Indian Premier League so far. He registered his name at the IPL 2024 auction for his base price of INR 75 lakh.\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to attract the bids at the auction. Nevertheless, he made a real case for himself as an aggressive batter in the recently-concluded MLC 2024 tournament, which strengthened his resume by a notch, making him a most-wanted asset for any T20 team. Let's take a glimpse at the three teams that will go after Finn Allen in the upcoming auction.\n\n1. Sunrisers Hyderabad: The 2016 IPL champions could benefit immensely from Finn Allen‚Äôs batting style. The cricket community saw the Sunrisers setting new records in the last season as the players adopted ultra-aggressive batting approach, which helped them record humongous totals. The IPL 2024 runners-up might show a great deal of interest to sign the New Zealander since he possesses all the qualities to accelerate the scoring rate.\n\n2. Chennai Super Kings: The five-time IPL champions purchased Rachin Ravindra for INR 1.8 crore at the previous auction. Unfortunately, the signing turned out to be an utter flop as he hardly upped his game as an opener. CSK who failed to qualify for the playoffs last season might offload Rachin Ravindra in an attempt to rope in fellow New Zealander Fin Allen as a long term investment. CSK might benefit from Allen's explosive stroke play in the powerplay overs.\n\n3. Gujarat Titans: The Ahmedabad-based franchise won the trophy in their debut season in IPL 2022. In the subsequent season, they failed to defend the title before surrendering at the hands of Chennai Super Kings in the final. However, they failed to qualify for the playoffs in IPL 2024 by finishing eighth on the points table. After a forgettable campaign, GT might try to sign quality players at the auction. If they manage to sign Finn Allen, he would bolster their lineup and enhance the team's chances of dominating the league.\n\nGet breaking news alerts.\n\nAllow Notifications\n\nOther articles published on Aug 1, 2024",

    "date": "",
    "body": "Australia Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins revealed the reason behind his decision to take a two-month hiatus from cricket. The pace bowler will be prepping himself for the upcoming five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against India later this year.\n\nCummins, who recently completed his debut in Major League Cricket (MLC) in the United States, has been given a vacation from Australia's limited-overs tour of the United Kingdom next month.\n\nThis choice was taken to properly manage his workload while also allowing him to focus on his physical training in preparation for a busy summer.\n\n\"Everyone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it. I've basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final, nearly 18 months ago. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover, and then I start building up again for the summer. It means you can hopefully bowl for a little bit longer, maintaining pace is a bit easier, makes you less susceptible to injuries,‚Äù Cummins told Fox Sports.\n\nSince 2023, Cummins has had a hectic schedule in international and league cricket. He started with an ODI series against India, the ICC World Cup win, three Test matches against Pakistan, two Tests against the West Indies, a T20 tour in New Zealand, two Test matches against New Zealand, the IPL 2024, the T20 World Cup 2024, and the MLC tournament.\n\n\"I'm very sore today after a week of the gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can't really nail it while you're in the midst of the season. I'll be doing lots of gym, some running, a lot of rehab exercise that you just can't really fit in the middle of the season,‚Äù he added.\n\nIndia will play a five-Test series in Australia for the first time since 1992. Australia has not won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy since 2017, with India winning four consecutive times. This includes their remarkable successes in Australia during the 2018-19 and 2020-21 tours.\n\nAs the captain, Cummins is determined to lead his team to victory and claim the trophy on home soil this season.\n\n\"It's the trophy I haven't won before... this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven't ticked off. We've achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home. I think you need to try and be up there in the upper echelon of teams.\n\nThat's what lies ahead of us this summer. They (India) are a really good side. We play them quite a lot, we know them really well, but we feel like we're really well placed also,\" he added.\n\nCummins has no plans to retire from Twenty20 cricket in the immediate future. He hopes to help Australia win a gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, which will include cricket for the first time in the event's history.\n\n\"Watching the Olympics, it got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle. I'd love to be on that side (at LA 2028). I think I'll be 35 or something, so hopefully still there or thereabouts. Honestly, right now, it feels a long way away. Maybe once we get closer and start building into it, everyone gets a bit more excited,\" he concluded.",

Due to the current unrest, he is unlikely to return to Bangladesh anytime soon.\n\nIt remains unclear whether his political identity would impact his selection in the national team. According to sources, Shakib's fitness for red-ball cricket is also a concern as he has been playing non-stop T20 matches since the home series against Zimbabwe in May.\n\n\"Before it was just about whether he [Shakib] could come to Bangladesh and then travel to Pakistan. He's been playing cricket but in a format where he has to score quickly in short time. And even though he knows how to play longer matches, there's a concern about whether he can handle the physical demands [of Test cricket],\" a BCB official told The Daily Star yesterday.\n\nThe selectors, who were unable to contact Shakib over the past week due to unrest situation, are likely to sit with skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in one or two days regarding the matter and other issues about the squad for the Pakistan Test series before they announce their final squad.\n\nIt was learned from another source that BCB has already formed an 18-member preliminary squad with Shakib and pacer Taskin Ahmed being in the team, but the final 15-member squad will be decided after the meeting with all the members of the selection panel, which had to be deferred a few times due to the current unrest situation.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, Cricket Operation In-charge Shahriar Nafees informed that Shakib's inclusion in the Test squad depends both on his availability and selection.\n\n\"He is only a cricketer now,\" Nafees told reporters in Mirpur. \"There is a question of whether he is available for the series now, and another being whether he gets picked for the tour.

This uncertainty could potentially affect his selection for the national team. Furthermore, there are concerns about Shakib's readiness for Test cricket, given his recent continuous T20 matches since the home series against Zimbabwe in May.\n\nAccording to a report by The Daily Star, a BCB official mentioned that the initial concern was whether Shakib could travel to Bangladesh and then Pakistan, but now there are worries about his ability to handle the physical demands of Test cricket after playing T20s. The selectors have struggled to reach Shakib over the past week due to the unrest and are expected to consult with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in the coming days before finalizing the squad.",

Despite the thrilling match where Smith‚Äôs Washington Freedom defeated Cummins‚Äô San Francisco Unicorns in the Major League Cricket (MLC) finals, it barely made headlines back home.\n\nSmith‚Äôs brilliant 88 off 52 balls secured the win at the same Grand Prairie ground that hosted the T20 World Cup opener in June. Interestingly, Cummins holds a little-known dominance over his Test vice-captain, dismissing Smith each time they‚Äôve faced in T20 matches. Their head-to-head record is 4 wickets for 8 runs from 13 balls, all occurring outside Australia.\n\nThe MLC, a two-year-old tournament in a non-Test playing nation, has achieved something Australia‚Äôs T20 league has not. ‚ÄúBeing in America offers a new experience players are eager to have,‚Äù said Michael Klinger, Washington Freedom‚Äôs general manager. The short three-week tournament and proximity following the World Cup in America and the Caribbean add to its appeal.\n\nBeyond star power, this MLC campaign showcased an increasing Australian influence. Cricket NSW (CNSW) and Cricket Victoria (CV) took pride as Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns, both not affiliated with IPL groups, extended their high-performance programs to these teams. Klinger and Graham Manou, former CV GM, were involved, and the\n\nfranchises are backed by Indian and Indian-American tech entrepreneurs.\n\nAustralians dominated off-field roles, with Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson as head coaches and Aussie support staff. The final featured eight Australians, including tournament MVP Travis Head and final‚Äôs Player of the Match, Smith. American players from these teams experienced the Big Bash, enhancing their professionalism.\n\nCricket Australia‚Äôs involvement in MLC is under consideration, eyeing benefits for Australian cricket, especially with cricket returning to the Olympics in 2028. Next month‚Äôs KFC BBL draft may see American players like Andries Gous and Saurabh Netravalkar join, marking a new chapter in the Australia-USA cricket relationship.\n\nDriving US cricket growth is its large south-Asian heritage population. The sell-out MLC final and high demand for the ICC World Cup highlight this interest. Ponting believes more grassroots promotion in the USA is needed, targeting young Americans and competing with baseball.\n\nThe MLC faces challenges with venue scarcity and the absence of a women‚Äôs league. However, it offers unique opportunities, drawing players like Cummins with Silicon Valley connections. Australian cricketers‚Äô social media posts from the USA also serve as great advertisements for the tournament.\n\nKlinger believes the MLC has an edge over England‚Äôs Hundred competition.

He was ruled out of the final part of his stint in The Hundred with a hamstring injury.\n\nHowever, having not played a Test match in three years, Rashid was set to return to the format in Afghanistan's one-off Test against New Zealand in India next month. Ahead of the series, Rashid returned to Afghanistan to take part in the Shpageeza League, which is the country's domestic T20 tournament.\n\nRashid played three matches for the Speen Ghar Tigers, all taking place on consecutive days, when he reportedly agitated his back injury.\n\nThe injury means his absence from the Test arena will continue, with the injury reportedly prompting Rashid to \"take a break\" from Test cricket. An ACB official reportedly told the Indian Express that Rashid has \"decided to take a break from Test cricket for one year\".\n\nAccording to the ICC's Future Tours Programme, Afghanistan are scheduled to play two Tests against Zimbabwe at the end of this year and a one-off Test against Ireland next July.\n\nRashid has taken 34 wickets across five Test matches in his career, and is Afghanistan's leading wicket-taker in the format.

It came just before the much-anticipated second season of MLC, the lucrative professional T20 league in the US luring top players around the world.\n\nMLC has been able to secure major sponsorship deals, highlighted by Cognizant ‚Äî a multinational information technology services and consulting company ‚Äî becoming its first title sponsor. Salary caps for teams are to remain the same, but top players will still be handsomely remunerated and earn around $175,000 for a minimum of five games ‚Äî rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\n\nWhile Indian players are not allowed to play outside of the IPL, a slew of stars will play in this season‚Äôs MLC ‚Äî many from Australia highlighted by San Francisco‚Äôs marquee signing of Pat Cummins to a four-year deal. Ahead of this season, MLC received official T20 league status with tournament playing records counted towards format statistics.\n\nWhile things are looking rosy in American cricket, there has been familiar warring behind the scenes with governing body USA Cricket amid continual turmoil after a spate of resignations and chief executive Dr. Noor Murad having his contract terminated earlier this year.\n\nUSA Cricket sanctions MLC, which is administered by American Cricket Enterprises after signing a 50-year commercial rights agreement in 2019. There are plans to expand MLC, with Chicago and Atlanta touted as possible new franchises amid a longer tournament earmarked to be played over much of June and July moving forward.\n\nThe 2024 Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup is done and dusted, ending the latest chapter of cricket‚Äôs onerous venture into the United States. America, where cricket has struggled to gain mainstream visibility for more than a century, hosted 16 of the tournament‚Äôs group-stage matches last month, while the remaining Super Eight games and knockouts took place in the Caribbean.\n\nThe T20 World Cup‚Äôs promotion through local media was headlined by a full-page advertisement in the New York Times that featured the Statue of Liberty raising a cricket bat. Olympic champion Usain Bolt opened the tournament at New York‚Äôs Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, a pop-up venue built specifically for the event, while former Indian all-rounder Yuvraj Singh appeared on NBC‚Äôs Good Morning America for a six-minute segment.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of Americans are walking in and they‚Äôre asking questions about the sport,‚Äù Ali Zar, a cricket store owner in New York, told BBC Sport ahead of the tournament. ‚ÄúI was born in Pakistan, so I know about this sport. My kids are born here, other kids are born here.

Smith‚Äôs strategic leadership played a crucial role in their dominant performance throughout the match. The Freedom‚Äôs impressive victory highlighted their exceptional skills and teamwork, as they effectively outplayed the Unicorns to claim the title. Smith‚Äôs influence and the team‚Äôs overall excellence were key to their triumphant season.\n\nWashington Freedom Maiden Title Win Against San Francisco Unicorns:\n\nWashington Freedom clinched their first Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 title with a decisive 96-run victory over the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas. Glenn Maxwell‚Äòs stellar batting performance played a key role, while Marco Jansen dismantled the Unicorns‚Äô chase, claiming three wickets including both openers. This win solidified Freedom‚Äôs reputation as the standout team of the season.\n\nHaving secured five group stage victories and advancing directly to the final after beating the Unicorns in the Qualifier, Freedom‚Äôs dominant display continued. A crucial 83-run standoff 39 balls between Steven Smith and Maxwell helped them amass 121 runs in the latter part of their innings.\n\nSteven Smith overcame a slow start during the powerplay to score a robust 88 off 52 balls, including six sixes. After struggling with just 10 runs off 12 balls in the sixth over, he accelerated to a half-century off 34 balls. Smith ended the season as the joint second-highest run-scorer, tied with Travis Head, amassing 336 runs at a strike rate of 148.67. His innings gained momentum with Andries Gous‚Äôs support, although the match became tense when Haris Rauf dismissed Rachin Ravindra, leaving Freedom at 86 for 3.\n\nSmith and Glenn Maxwell then shifted the balance, with Maxwell finding his form towards the end of the season. They scored 28 runs in the 13th over against Juanoy Drysdale. Smith showcased his flair with a stunning scoop for six off Rauf and was approaching a century when he was dismissed by a top edge off Pat Cummins.\n\nSmith‚Äôs T20I career seems to be winding down after his World Cup omission and exclusion from the September squad facing Scotland and England, as selectors shift focus to emerging talent. Despite Maxwell‚Äôs dismissal by Josh Inglis in the next over, Freedom still managed to exceed 200 runs.\n\nThe Unicorns‚Äô chase never gained momentum. Jake Fraser-McGurk‚Äôs underwhelming tournament ended when he was dismissed by Jansen, leaving him with just 81 runs at an average of 11.57. Both Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Allen fell during the powerplay, setting a challenging task. Sherfane Rutherford, after being dropped, was brilliantly caught by Ian Holland, and the rest of the batting collapsed under the mounting run rate.\n\nRicky Ponting About the Maiden Win:\n\nFreedom‚Äôs win awarded Ricky Ponting his first coaching title shortly after his exit from the Delhi Capitals.

    "body": "Washington Freedom won their maiden Major League Cricket title with a convincing win over the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas on Sunday. For the second consecutive year, we made it to the Playoffs, showing marked improvement from our loss in the Eliminator last year.\n\nThe team was very consistent this season, topping the points table throughout the league phase of the tournament. We lost just once in the course of nine matches, thanks to several clinical performances from our players.\n\nHere is a look at some of the best individual performances by our players this season.\n\nSteve Smith‚Äôs 88 off 52 balls vs SFU\n\nThere are many reasons why this knock against the San Francisco Unicorns in Dallas stands at the top of the list. It was the final of MLC 2024, and the in-form Travis Head departed in the second over of the match.\n\nSkipper Steve Smith had to ensure that the scoring rate did not drop while also preventing further wickets from falling. He, along with Andries Gous, kept the scoreboard ticking, frequently finding boundaries.\n\nFrom 27 off 25 balls, Smith shifted gears to bring up his fifty in 34 balls. He scored 61 runs in his last 27 balls as we powered to 207/5, the highest total by any team this season.\n\nSmith added 83 runs with Glenn Maxwell from just 39 balls as we amassed 107 runs in the last eight overs of our innings. Smith had already set the base for a final flourish when he departed in the 17th over for a 52-ball 88, an innings laden with six sixes and seven fours. He deservedly won the Player of the Match award in the final after our 96-run win.\n\nTravis Head‚Äôs 77* off 44 balls vs SFU\n\nChasing 146 against the Unicorns in the Qualifier match in Dallas, Travis Head opened up in the third over after settling in. Head smashed three sixes and two fours to score 30 runs off Carmi le Roux‚Äôs two overs.\n\nWe raced to 52/1, with Head already on 41 off just 21 balls at the end of the powerplay. There was a quiet phase as we lost two wickets in the next three overs. However, Head returned to form once he reached his half-century, scoring boundaries at will.\n\nHead put together an unbeaten partnership of 85 off just 40 balls for the fourth wicket, making light work of the chase. The southpaw was unbeaten on 77 from 44 balls, with 10 fours and three sixes, as we romped home with a seven-wicket win with 27 balls to spare.\n\nRachin Ravindra 4/11 vs SFU\n\nRachin Ravindra picked up his career-best figures of 4/11 in T20 cricket in the Qualifier of MLC 2024 against San Francisco Unicorns at Dallas, which we won by seven wickets. Coming into the attack after the powerplay, Ravindra dismissed the dangerous Sanjay Krishnamurthi, the top-scorer in the last match between the two sides, off his third ball of the day.\n\nRavindra surprised Krishnamurthi with an arm ball that came in at pace, trapping him in front of the wicket. A wicket maiden to start with and he could not have asked for anything more.\n\nRavindra came back into the attack in the 18th over as Lockie Ferguson got injured after bowling two deliveries. He picked up two more off the next three balls as Haris Rauf holed out in the deep and Carmi le Roux found the timber disturbed.\n\nIn the last over, Ravindra outclassed Hassan Khan as he stepped out looking to force the pace and get some valuable runs. Ravindra bowled it wide and Hassan was caught short of his crease and had to walk back after top-scoring for the Unicorns with 57.\n\nLockie Ferguson 4/26 vs Seattle Orcas\n\nLockie Ferguson had a memorable spell against the Seattle Orcas in our group game at Dallas in MLC 2024 picking up 4/26 against them. Bowling the last over of the powerplay, Ferguson did not have an ideal start getting hit for a six and four in his first three balls.\n\nBut he came back strongly to dismiss Ryan Rickleton who was coming into this game after scoring an unbeaten century in his last match. In his next over, Ferguson bowled Quinton de Kock, who was looking in good nick, as the Orcas were reduced to 44/3.\n\nReturning to complete his spell during the death, Ferguson put the brakes on Orcas with a double strike in the 17th over. He beat the batters with his sheer pace as Imad Wasim nicked to the keeper and Hammad Azam was out leg before wicket.\n\nHe conceded just three runs in the over to finish with impressive figures of 4/26 in four overs. The Orcas were dismissed for 124 and we won the match by five wickets.",

His critical assessment highlighted potential issues within the tournament and suggested that despite the presence of renowned players, the competition did not meet the expectations set by its inaugural season.\n\n\"For some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe, because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual,\" Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar.\n\nThe former Indian captain also highlighted the significant drop in crowd turnout for the tournament, which starkly contrasted with the enthusiastic attendance seen during the tournament's first edition.\n\n\"This makes one feel that while nobody wants the players‚Äô source of income to be curbed, it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in, say, three leagues. The whole world agrees that the IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world.

In a tournament marked by high-scoring encounters and thrilling finishes, the Freedom‚Äôs triumph was a testament to their exceptional talent and unwavering consistency. Their journey to the title was nothing short of spectacular, as they dominated the group stage and carried their momentum into the playoffs.\n\nWith Smith at the helm, the Freedom‚Äôs batting lineup was a formidable force. His ability to construct innings with calculated aggression and explosive power proved to be the difference-maker. The final was a showcase of his brilliance as he anchored the innings with a match-winning knock. However, the Freedom‚Äôs success was not solely reliant on Smith. The team boasted a deep batting order, with players like Glenn Maxwell providing crucial contributions. Their bowlers were equally impressive, executing their plans to perfection and stifling the opposition.\n\nThe Unicorns, despite their valiant efforts, were unable to match the Freedom‚Äôs intensity. A combination of factors, including a slow start and the inability to find their footing with the bat throughout, contributed to their defeat. Nevertheless, their participation in the final was a significant achievement and will undoubtedly serve as a platform for future success.\n\nAs the curtain falls on the second MLC season, the tournament has already established itself as a major force in the global cricket landscape. With its blend of high-quality cricket, star power, and entertainment, the MLC has captured the imagination of fans worldwide. The Washington Freedom‚Äôs championship-winning campaign will be remembered as a defining moment in the league‚Äôs history.\n\nSmith‚Äôs Stellar Knock\n\nSmith, who had been overlooked for Australia‚Äôs T20 World Cup squad earlier this year, silenced his critics with a match-winning performance. After a slow start, the right-hander exploded into life, showcasing his exceptional ability to clear the ropes with disdain. His innings of 88 off 52 balls, including six maximums, was a masterclass in T20 batting.\n\nA crucial partnership with Glenn Maxwell, who also contributed a valuable 40, propelled Freedom to a formidable total of 207 for 5. Smith‚Äôs knock not only propelled his team to victory but also solidified his reputation as one of the world‚Äôs premier T20 batsmen.\n\nAlso Read: Braithwaite‚Äôs Heroics in the 2016 T20 World Cup\n\nUnicorns‚Äô Innings Collapse\n\nSan Francisco Unicorns faced an uphill battle from the outset, and their chase never truly gained momentum. Marco Jansen made early inroads, removing both openers, but the damage had already been done. The required run rate soared as wickets tumbled, and the Unicorns were unable to keep pace with the demanding target.\n\nFreedom‚Äôs bowling attack was relentless, with Jansen and Riley Meredith sharing six wickets between them. The Unicorns‚Äô batting lineup, which had shown promise in previous matches, was completely outclassed on the big stage.\n\nA Fitting End to a Successful Campaign for Washington Freedom\n\nThe victory not only secured the MLC title for Washington Freedom but also marked a successful coaching stint for Ricky Ponting. The Australian legend, who recently stepped down as coach of the Delhi Capitals, ended his season on a high note.\n\nSmith‚Äôs exceptional performance and Freedom‚Äôs overall dominance have undoubtedly elevated the MLC to new heights. The tournament has showcased the immense talent on display in the United States and has laid the foundation for the growth of cricket in the country. As the league continues to expand, fans can expect even more thrilling contests and emerging stars in the years to come.",

In the first part we explored the deal with Lexus.\n\nGaming sponsors have become mainstream throughout the cricket world. From franchise tournaments, to national teams, to individual stars, it is hard not to see online gaming branding everywhere you turn.\n\nIn the midst of this ubiquity, however, Major League Cricket accomplished something new in 2024 on the gaming sponsorship front: attracting the largest online gaming company, Stake, into the cricket world.\n\nDiving headfirst into cricket\n\nDespite their size and stature, Stake had surprisingly not previously been involved in cricket.\n\nAccording to Dominic Rae, Sponsorship Manager for Stake, who managed the MLC relationship: ‚ÄúThis year was really the first time we‚Äôve made major moves in the cricket space. We partnered with Ravi Shastri and Major League Cricket (MLC) in two significant steps, and we have exciting plans to increase our presence in the coming years.‚Äù\n\nMonica Sadhu, MLC‚Äôs VP of Commercial Partnerships, who brokered the deal for the league,added: ‚ÄúStake has been expanding its sports sponsorship portfolio worldwide. The timing was conducive to this alignment as their first investment in cricket through the partnership with Major League Cricket.‚Äù\n\nAttracted by quality\n\nSurprisingly, what attracted Stake to the MLC was not so much the US market itself, but the quality of the tournament.\n\nAs Rae says: ‚ÄúWith the MLC partnership we weren‚Äôt so focused on the territory, but with the product, and in the inaugural MLC season in 2023 we were really impressed with the tournament and what the team behind it were able to achieve in such a short space of time.‚Äù\n\nStake was further attracted by the MLC‚Äôs vision and plans for the future: ‚ÄúIn our initial conversations the ambition for growth was clear and resonated well with us, so it was a simple decision when the opportunity came to become an official partner.‚Äù\n\nMLC‚Äôs Sadhu agrees, and adds that a big part of the attraction to the MLC beyond the product comes from ‚Äúthe names behind it, and the investors on board, When you have majority owners of the likes of IPL powerhouses like KKR, CSK, and Mumbai Indians in addition to other serious investors such as Delhi Capitals and our local US ownership groups, it legitimizes the league and gives players and sponsors the confidence to participate.‚Äù\n\n5,000% growth\n\nSadhu said she was very confident that for a gaming company, a high-profile tournament sponsorship would deliver tremendous value. ‚ÄúGiven the market size of the US combined with the MLC‚Äôs extensive global broadcast footprint, covering over 100 countries, we were sure that Stake would recoup its investment in the partnership very quickly.‚Äù\n\nStake‚Äôs Rae concurred, saying that the sponsorship performance exceeded Stake‚Äôs expectations. ‚ÄúWe were delighted with the sponsorship this season‚Ä¶ From a broadcast perspective our branding was highly prominent and accepted bets on MLC were up nearly 5,000% year-on-year, with betting turnover increasing by nearly 1,000%. By any standard that marks a successful sponsorship.‚Äù\n\nThe data speaks volumes\n\nGaming sponsors, given their unique vantage point and real time data about a global user base transacting on games, can provide a unique insight into the performance of a property overall.\n\nIndeed, Rae confirmed that their data showed that the MLC Season two was on a very strong upward trajectory.\n\n‚ÄúWe saw massive interest in MLC from many territories. MLC has a number of significant broadcast agreements worldwide, and with household names from many top international teams, as well as the ever improving domestic talent, it‚Äôs not surprising that it captured the attention of the global cricketing audience.‚Äù\n\nExcitement for the future\n\nA recurring theme throughout MLC Season 2 was the feeling that the tournament was ascending close to the top position in overall star power and quality of all franchise T20 tournaments, second only to the IPL.\n\nStake confirmed this.\n\n‚ÄúHaving attended the tournament finals in person I was hugely impressed with the stadium experience at Grand Prairie and the calibre of cricket on show‚Ä¶ The calibre of play is a match for any T20 league outside of the IPL.‚Äù\n\nThis bodes well for the future of the MLC and its partnership with Stake. As Rae reiterated: ‚Äúwe are very excited for the journey we hope to continue with MLC.‚Äù\n\nSadhu concurred: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a fantastic partnership ‚Äî as a client Stake were extremely easy to work with given our alignment, and we‚Äôve been very happy with the association. The synergies were strong, and we look forward to continuing the partnership.‚Äù",

    "body": "Cricket fans witnessed yet another nail-biter as the San Francisco Unicorns edged out MI New York by just three runs at the Major League Cricket tournament on July 19. The game's excitement was palpable, and it showcased the thrilling nature of T20 cricket and what can happen when two competitive teams clash on the field.\n\nThe Unicorns initially batted first, struggling to build momentum as they stumbled at 148 runs, losing seven wickets over their 20 overs. This opening innings was marked by uncertainty, with several critical wickets falling at key moments. After establishing the foundation with their top order missing, the middle and lower orders had to scramble to salvage as many runs as possible.\n\nCorey Anderson stood out as the leading scorer for the Unicorns, contributing 47 runs from 32 balls. Anderson's innings included five fours and two sixes, which proved instrumental in keeping the score respectable. He, along with Pat Cummins, who smashed 28 runs off just 14 balls, gave the Unicorns the late push they desperately needed. Cummins' aggressive batting and windfall of runs helped breathe life back for the Unicorns as they looked to defend their score against MI New York.\n\nMI New York, armed with their own star players, walked onto the field confidently. Chasing 149 runs, they had the heavy hitters necessary for such tall orders. They quickly got to work, but the hopes of their fans were soon dealt severe blows. Early wickets fell to the Unicorns' impressive bowling lineup, leaving MI New York struggling at 41 runs with only three wickets to show at one point.\n\nDespite the shaky start, MI New York showed resilience and made brief comebacks at various stages, particularly through Heath Richards, who rallied to score 28 runs and included some thrilling moments as he smacked sixes and fours throughout his innings. Each run seemed to fuel the growing anticipation among the fans, but the mounting pressure and tight bowling soon began to take its toll.\n\nThe climax of the game unfolded under the dazzling lights, with MI New York's score teetering on the edge of victory. With just ten runs needed from the final over, the excitement turned electric. But the Unicorns' bowlers held their nerve. The last over encapsulated the drama of T20 cricket, as MI New York went from hopefuls to the brink of defeat. Last-minute wickets fell, and it all came down to one final delivery, needing just one run to tie. Alas, MI New York ended their innings at 145 runs, falling just short of taking the win.\n\nUnicorns' Rashid Khan played a critical role as their star bowler, snaring 4 wickets for just 32 runs across his four overs. His wicket-taking ability proved utterly destructive, particularly during the middle overs, which helped prevent MI New York from ever fully stabilizing their chase. Alongside Rashid, Romario Shepherd also shone with the ball, securing 2 wickets and maintaining pressure on the MI New York batters.\n\nThe crowd was entertained, and the match illustrated the entertainment and unpredictability of T20 cricket. Each ball delivered, each swing of the bat, and every catch taken contributed not just to the game but to the excitement radiated from the stadium. Fans knew they were part of something special, filled with adrenaline and suspense.\n\nDespite the heartbreak of narrowly losing, MI New York‚Äôs performance could not be dismissed. Their fight so deeply embedded the spirit of the game, and fans took heart knowing their team could have easily turned the tables with just one more good run. For the Unicorns, it's all about how they maintained focus and demonstrated key elements of composure, skill, and strategy at the critical moments.\n\nWhile both teams displayed moments of brilliance, the day undoubtedly belonged to the San Francisco Unicorns. Their victory serves as another reminder of the charm and unpredictability of cricket, especially within the thrilling structure of T20. The excitement is only meant to build up as the tournament progresses.\n\nLooking ahead, fans are eager to see how both teams will adjust and learn from their respective performances. Each match is not just about the scores but developing strategies and building momentum through the series. With every game, teams will aim to solidify their places and potentially head for the playoff rounds.",

Meanwhile, Cricket Operations In-charge Shahriar Nafees has stated that Shakib's inclusion will depend on both his availability and his selection for the series.\n\nAll-rounder withdraws from BD 'A' team's tour of Pak\n\nSaifuddin, who was selected for the second four-day match of a two-match series and the subsequent three-match one-day series against Pakistan 'A', communicated his need for a break via email\n\nAll-rounder Mohammad Saifuddin has withdrawn from the upcoming Bangladesh 'A' team's tour of Pakistan, citing mental exhaustion and requesting a two-month break from all cricketing activities.\n\nSaifuddin, who was selected for the second four-day match of a two-match series and the subsequent three-match one-day series against Pakistan 'A', communicated his need for a break via email to the selectors earlier this month, according to a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official.\n\nIn his email, Saifuddin expressed his disappointment over not being selected for the ICC T20 World Cup squad in June and his inability to travel to Canada for the ongoing Global T20 due to unrest in the country.\n\n\"Due to these matters, I want to keep myself away from all forms of cricket for the next two months. Hopefully, you will take the matter in a positive way,\" Saifuddin's email read.\n\nHowever, Saifuddin did not mention the right rib injury he sustained during a gym session in Mirpur two days before his scheduled flight to Canada in late July. He was set to represent the Montreal Tigers in the GT20, having obtained a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the BCB until August 8. Afterward, he was expected to join the 'A' team in Pakistan.\n\nBCB physio Muzadded Sany explained that Saifuddin noticed the injury after the gym session and consulted the BCB medical team when the pain persisted. BCB chief physician Dr. Debashish Chowdhury assessed his condition and provided treatment instructions, noting the severity of the pain. Concerns about the impact of a 22-hour economy-class flight on his injury led the BCB to advise against his travel to Canada.\n\nAccording to the report in The Daily Star, Saifuddin's recent letter has frustrated the selectors, as he had missed most of the Bangladesh Tigers' practice sessions in Sylhet and Chattogram last month.\n\nAn anonymous official noted that Saifuddin only participated in nine days of practice in Sylhet and four days in Chattogram out of a 45-day camp. He left the Chattogram camp early, citing the need to attend a biometric appointment for his Canada visa.\n\nPreviously, he had taken leave for family issues before Eid, and subsequently requested an extension, which was granted due to the family emergency. The official concluded by expressing concern over Saifuddin's current reluctance towards cricket.",
    "summary": "* Shakib Al Hasan, a premier all-rounder, had planned to return to Bangladesh from the USA, where he was playing in the Major League Cricket, following his NOC from the BCB until August 12.\n* However, Shakib's situation has changed after he lost his parliamentary seat due to the recent political unrest, which may delay his return to Bangladesh and affect his selection for the national team.\n\nNote: The article does not provide any additional information about the Major League Cricket tournament itself, only mentioning Shakib's participation in it.",

    "body": "The participation of Bangladesh's premier left-arm spin bowling all-rounder, Shakib Al Hasan, in the upcoming two-match Test series against Pakistan, set to begin on August 21 in Rawalpindi, remains uncertain.\n\nAccording to a report in The Daily Star newspaper, Shakib, who is currently playing in the Global T20 Canada league after participating in the Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA last month, was granted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) until August 12. Following this, he was expected to join the national team either in Bangladesh or directly in Pakistan.\n\nHowever, due to the current unrest in Bangladesh, which led to the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her departure from the country, Shakib is unlikely to return soon. Additionally, Shakib, who was elected as a Member of Parliament via the Awami League party, is no longer a lawmaker due to the dissolution of the Bangladesh Parliament.\n\nThe report, though, says Shakib's fitness for playing red-ball cricket is a concern for the selectors as he has been playing T20 matches since May. \"Before it was just about whether he (Shakib) could come to Bangladesh and then travel to Pakistan. He's been playing cricket but, in a format, where he has to score quickly in a short time. And even though he knows how to play longer matches, there's a concern about whether he can handle the physical demands (of Test cricket),\" a BCB official was quoted as saying in the report.\n\nIt added that the selectors are likely to talk to skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in one or two days to finalise the 15-member squad for the Test series against Pakistan.\n\nShahriar Nafees, in charge of Cricket Operations with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), was quoted as saying in the report that Shakib's inclusion in the Test team is dependent on both his availability and selection.\n\n\"He is only a cricketer now. There is a question of whether he is available for the series now and another is whether he gets picked for the tour. We will run our activity keeping these two factors in mind,\" he concluded.",

    "date": "Wed Aug  7 00:00:00 2024",
    "body": "Growing a professional sport in the US is a massive undertaking: a multi-decade, multi-front effort.\n\nAmong many other tactics, it requires exposing the sport to potential new fans, and having a product compelling enough to convert them into regular ones.\n\nSeason 2 of Cognizant Major League Cricket (MLC), held this past July, provided such a product. It featured dozens of the world‚Äôs top stars ‚Äì a collection of franchise talent many say is second only to the IPL ‚Äì and an exciting level of play.\n\nBut having a great tournament is actually the easier half of the battle.\n\nThe bigger challenge is getting a potential audience ‚Äì existing cricket fans and, more importantly, non-cricket fans ‚Äì to notice what is going on to begin with.\n\nJust getting to that starting point requires first winning an all-out war for consumer attention: against every other entrenched major professional sport and every form of passive video entertainment ‚Äì from YouTube to social media platforms to streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon.\n\nWith the dust now settling on MLC Season 2, it is becoming clear that the awareness initiative with arguably the highest impact this time around, and with even stronger potential for future seasons, was Willow by Cricbuzz‚Äôs local broadcast partnership strategy, spearheaded by COO Todd Myers.\n\nSpecifically, Willow partnered with Regional Sports Networks (RSNs) for each of the MLC teams to broadcast select free MLC matches, even though Willow itself is a subscription-based broadcaster.\n\nWillow and the MLC\n\nWillow by Cricbuzz (‚ÄúWillow TV‚Äù or ‚ÄúWillow‚Äù), owned by Times Internet, is a pillar of US cricket. It is the official North American broadcaster for the ICC, virtually all major franchise tournaments, and many national boards. So it has a keen interest in growing cricket in the US.\n\nMoreover, Willow was not only the official North American broadcaster of Major League Cricket‚Äôs Season 2, it was also a major sponsor ‚Äì one of the two Official Partners.\n\nIt was through that lens that Willow‚Äôs COO Myers ‚Äì who previously spent over 16 years as a producer programming director with ESPN ‚Äì approached the challenge of expanding the MLC‚Äôs broadcast audience.\n\n‚ÄúLook,‚Äù says Myers, ‚Äúwe want to grow cricket in the US. And one path to do that is to expose cricket to more mainstream sports fans that are watching other sports.‚Äù\n\nSo Myers conceived of an ambitious plan only a few months before the tournament to partner with RSNs, namely:\n\nMonumental Sports Network (DC Freedom)\n\nYES Network (MI New York)\n\nROOT SPORTS (Seattle Orcas)\n\nBally Sports Southwest (Texas Super Kings)\n\nBally Sports SoCal (LA Knight Riders)\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\nNBC Sports California (San Francisco Unicorns)\n\n‚ÄúThese RSNs combined reach a way larger potential audience than Willow. And it‚Äôs that exposure piece for the league, for the individual teams and then for the sport of cricket to grow as well.‚Äù\n\nConverting local sports fans to cricket fans, one at a time\n\nBeyond the simple exposure math, Myers emphasized the importance of RSNs to introducing existing local sports fans to a new local sports team.\n\n‚ÄúSo we have a deal with Root Sports Northwest. You like Seattle sports? Great. We‚Äôve got another professional team for you to root for, the Seattle Orcas. And oh, by the way, if you‚Äôre watching the Mariners game, you can watch the cricket. There‚Äôs no additional subscription fee that you have to pay, or subscribe to another tier on television. It‚Äôs all Root Sports Northwest. ‚Äù\n\nSeattle Orcas CEO Hemant Dua noted how the value was not just in broadcasting into new homes, but also bringing cricket into public spaces, especially sports bars, and introducing the sport beyond the traditional South Asian audience.\n\n‚ÄúSports pubs are visited by the local populations and the percentage of South Asians is probably 5% of the foot traffic footfalls, right? And if you look at what‚Äôs up on the screen it‚Äôs all the time? Root Sports. So even a few matches shown this year, at the pubs thousands will see cricket. That to me if, even out of that a small percentage convert, that‚Äôs a huge win.‚Äù\n\nThe Orcas took it a step further and planned local activations around games, complete with games and fan activities, at major sports bars such as Seattle‚Äôs Flat Stick pub:\n\nMulti-platform collaboration\n\nThe partnerships between teams and RSNs also extended beyond broadcast and into social media.\n\nFor example, the YES Network (owned by the New York Yankees) did extensive social posts with the MI New York team.\n\nThis worked as expected: networks like YES were thrilled to collaborate with players with social media profiles of the magnitude of Rashid Khan.\n\nAccording to Jared Boshnack, the YES Network VP of Production, ‚ÄúThe entire MI New York organization and their partners were incredible to work with and we used assets to collaborate and execute promotions across all of our platforms.‚Äù\n\nThis was also an effective channel to introduce cricket to new American fans, as seen in priceless comments such as: ‚ÄúCan any of these guys play 2nd base?‚Äù\n\nThe YES Network also included cricket in its other programming, including a ‚ÄúCricket 101‚Äù segment on Jimmy ‚ÄòJomboy‚Äô O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs popular studio show.\n\nPlaying away from home\n\nAnother important function played by these broadcast partnerships was helping solidify the connection between local fans and teams that were not playing in their hometowns.\n\nWith the exception of the Texas Super Kings, none of the MLC teams have a home stadium, and these other five teams played all their games on the road in Grand Prairie, TX or Morrisville, NC\n\nIn that context, these broadcasts are critical to bridging the gap between now and a future where MLC teams all play home games. David White, GM of the San Francisco Unicorns, explains:\n\n‚ÄúTo take Major League Cricket to its full potential, it‚Äôs critical that we have the broadcast partners to take what is a first class sporting product to the widest audiences. We want to give Unicorns fans the chance to watch their heroes while they‚Äôre on the road.\n\n‚ÄúThis partnership with NBC Sports is the ideal platform to showcase what the Unicorns are all about to a sports mad Bay Area, and will lay the foundations for future support as we look to build a local fan base capable of filling out our future stadium game in, game out.‚Äù\n\nA two-way street\n\nFor as much value as the MLC teams and the league are getting out of the RSN partnerships, the RSNs are getting tremendous benefits as well.\n\nFor starters, cricket brings with it a very attractive demographic. Just as teams are eager to reach local fans of same-city sports teams, Regional Sports Networks are keen to expand their network to new local audiences, especially the professional-heavy South Asian demographic, which is present in large numbers in all the MLC markets.\n\nCaitlin Mangum, Vice President, Content & Programming at Monumental Sports Network agreed with this: ‚ÄúCricket is undergoing a surge of popularity in the U.S. and we‚Äôre excited for a new audience to get exposure to the plethora of live, local sports programming on our air.‚Äù\n\nThe other valuable asset that the RSNs are obtaining in these partnerships is the content itself. And this comes at an interesting and challenging time for RSNs, who are facing a major challenge from streaming and OTT models.\n\nThe Yes Network, owned by the Yankees, is an exception to these content challenges. But the remainder of the RSNs in question have to license sports content from teams, and are also losing subscribers, leading to well documented challenges to their business models.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the content provided by cricket is a very welcome, and attractive, asset.\n\nEducating RSNs\n\nAccording to Willow‚Äôs Myers, when he first reached out to the RSNs about the possibility, they were extremely positive:\n\n‚ÄúEach of the RSNs was truly very enthusiastic about it. We didn‚Äôt have any negativity from the other side of like ‚Äì oh that‚Äôs cricket, we don‚Äôt care. No one said viewers won‚Äôt care. It was the exact opposite: ‚ÄòThis is cool. We love to try to be part of this and help grow MLC and grow cricket.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nAt the same time, they needed to be educated, especially on cricket as a broadcasting proposition.\n\nMyers continued: ‚ÄúI had to educate them, which is probably no surprise, on just what the sport of cricket is. Not that they didn‚Äôt know the sport existed, but: here‚Äôs how a game works, how to use vernacular, how a match plays out ‚Äì ex. after every over there‚Äôs a 30 second commercial, explaining to them that when there‚Äôs a strategic time out or when a wicket falls that creates a commercial break. So kind of explaining them to the game. But all of them were very enthusiastic.‚Äù\n\nLessons for the future: an earlier start in 2025\n\nIf there was one glaring area for improvement in the future for this initiative, it is in the execution timeline.\n\nMyers reflects on lessons learned: ‚ÄúWhat would I change? I would engage with our RSN partners a lot earlier. Because literally we were completing deals right up until almost when the first ball was bowled. And that was because we reached out really late to try to make this happen. It takes time to get contracts done.‚Äù\n\nAs a result, the opportunity was not maximized. RSN schedules are programmed in advance, and not everything could fall neatly into place this time.\n\nLead time would also help with respect to planning marketing activations like the Orcas pursued.\n\nMyers continued: ‚ÄúInstead of engaging with these partners in mid-May, it should be early April. But the second time around should be easier. They will have (already) done it. We won‚Äôt have to go through the education process again, it should be more streamlined.‚Äù\n\nAll that said, the teams are already getting excited for 2025.\n\n‚ÄúI think Todd‚Äôs done a great job on this,‚Äù said the Orcas‚Äô Dua, summing up the sentiment in the league about Willow‚Äôs initiative. ‚ÄúSo more power to him and we‚Äôre very excited and we want to build this and showcase all our games next year.‚Äù",
    "summary": "The second season of the MLC, held in July, featured top cricket stars and exciting gameplay, but the bigger challenge is getting a potential audience to notice the tournament.

This strategy aimed to expose cricket to more mainstream sports fans and grow the sport in the US.\n\nThe partnership with RSNs, including Monumental Sports Network, YES Network, ROOT SPORTS, Bally Sports Southwest, Bally Sports SoCal, NBC Sports Bay Area, and NBC Sports California, allowed MLC teams to reach a wider audience and introduce cricket to local sports fans. The broadcasts helped bridge the gap between teams playing on the road and their local fans.\n\nThe RSNs also benefited from the partnership, gaining access to an attractive demographic and valuable content. However, the RSNs needed education on cricket as a broadcasting proposition, and the execution timeline was a lesson learned for improvement in the future. The teams are already looking forward to building on this initiative in 2025.",

Shakib is currently playing in the Global T20 Canada tournament and had earlier expressed interest in joining the Test series, which starts on August 21 in Rawalpindi. He had intended to come back to Bangladesh from the USA, where he was playing in the Major League Cricket, after his permission from the BCB ended on August 12.\n\nBut things have changed for Shakib since he lost his position in parliament on August 6 because of recent political problems, which might make him come back to Bangladesh later. This change could possibly affect whether he gets picked for the national team. Also, there are worries about whether Shakib is ready for Test cricket, considering he has been playing continuous T20 matches since the series against Zimbabwe in May.\n\nA BCB official said in a report that they were first worried if Shakib could go to Bangladesh and then Pakistan, but now they are concerned about if he can handle the physical challenges of Test cricket after playing T20 games. The selectors have had trouble contacting Shakib in the last week because of the unrest, and they plan to talk to captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha in the next few days before picking the final team.\n\nThe report also mentioned that an 18-player preliminary team has been made, including Shakib and fast bowler Taskin Ahmed, but the final 15-player team will be chosen after talking with the selection panel. Cricket Operations In-charge Shahriar Nafees said that whether Shakib is included in the team will depend on if he is available and if he is chosen for the series.",

    "body": "Australia‚Äôs Test captain, Pat Cummins, has announced an eight-week break to rejuvenate himself ahead of the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India later this year. This decision comes after a demanding schedule that included his debut in Major League Cricket (MLC) and a busy international calendar.\n\nA Well-Deserved Break\n\nCummins, who recently returned from the United States after participating in the MLC, was rested for the upcoming white-ball tour of the United Kingdom to manage his workload effectively. He expressed his thoughts on taking a break, stating, ‚ÄúEveryone that comes back after a break is a little bit fresher, you never regret it.‚Äù This time off will allow him to recover physically after nearly 18 months of continuous bowling since the World Test Championship final.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve basically been bowling non-stop since the World Test Championship final. This gives me a good seven or eight weeks completely off bowling so the body can recover,‚Äù Cummins explained. He believes that this break will help him maintain his pace and reduce the risk of injuries when he returns to the field.\n\nRecent Challenges\n\nThe past year has been particularly taxing for Cummins, who fractured his wrist during the Ashes series in England. Despite this setback, he has continued to play a crucial role for Australia, participating in various formats, including the IPL 2024, the T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies, the MLC 2024, and multiple Test series.\n\nReflecting on his physical state, Cummins mentioned, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very sore today after a week of gym. Hamstrings, even ankles, kind of build up over months of bowling, but you can‚Äôt really nail it while you‚Äôre in the midst of the season.‚Äù He plans to focus on gym workouts, running, and rehabilitation exercises during his break.\n\nThe Importance of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy\n\nThe upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy will consist of five Test matches, and Cummins is eager to lift the trophy, which has eluded Australia since 2017. India has dominated the series in recent years, winning four consecutive titles, including historic victories on Australian soil in 2018-19 and 2020-21.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the trophy I haven‚Äôt won before‚Ä¶ this is the one trophy a lot of our group haven‚Äôt ticked off,‚Äù Cummins stated. He emphasized the importance of the series, noting, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve achieved some amazing things over the last few years as a Test group. You kind of back yourself to win every series at home.‚Äù\n\nFuture Aspirations\n\nLooking beyond the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Cummins is also eyeing the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make its debut. He expressed his desire to compete for Australia in the Olympics, stating, ‚ÄúWatching the Olympics got us all excited. You want to be part of it right there in the middle.‚Äù\n\nAt 31, Cummins hopes to still be in contention for selection when the time comes. ‚ÄúHonestly right now, it feels a long way away. Maybe once we get closer and start building into it, everyone gets a bit more excited,‚Äù he added.",

He urged USA Cricket to push the game at the grassroots level especially for kids.\n\nLocal administrators have already got that ball rolling with multiple initiatives like a minor league that has brought small clubs and teams from across the country under its umbrella. The country has been divided into four zones to allow for easier selection and scouting, given that most US states might not have a strong cricket presence unlike more established cricket playing nations. According to USA Cricket, there are over 400 local leagues with around 200,000 players active around the country.\n\nPlans are afoot to have a rookie league for newer entrants into the sport and age group tournaments with academies to nurture young talent, along with training for umpires and coaches. While still nascent, USA women‚Äôs cricket is slowly finding a foothold in the international game.\n\nWhen Ponting spoke about grassroots though, he wasn‚Äôt just referring to the usual round of expats and first/second generation immigrants from cricketing countries like South Asia and the Caribbean, but children from all ethnic and cultural groups that call the U.S. their home.\n\nI admire Ponting‚Äôs trademark Aussie bullishness but Americans still view cricket as this archaic pastime that they can use as fodder for bad jokes. If only they saw how baseball is a poor substitute, they might change their perspective.\n\nNow that I‚Äôve drummed up controversy, let‚Äôs get realistic for a second. Cricket is still very much an expat sport in the U.S.; they hosted an entire World Cup and it barely scratched the veneer of American primetime television.\n\nMillions of Americans watched bemused at Indian techies frothing at the mouth supported men in blue. Grounds and accessibility were woeful especially in New York, and for those who could make it to the venue, ticket prices, upwards of $300 were out of reach. Major League Cricket addresses some of those failings in cost and access. They might spread the gospel of cricket in America but seem to operate in a comfy bubble of expat eyeballs.\n\nFor a beloved sport to be taken seriously in the U.S., this not-so-humble armchair critic feels that there has to be some bombastic cross promotions with other sporting megabeasts like the NBA or the NFL. Good luck getting those behemoths to share airspace but in my dream scenario, I see Steph Curry bowling or Lebron hitting a six out of the ground. If we can get superstars to play cricket and experience its joys, then audiences might start paying attention beyond a distracted guffaw at hearing that a cricket match can go on for five days.\n\nUSA Cricket has an arduous journey ahead, especially after being pulled up by the ICC for ‚Äúnon compliance‚Äù with the requirements of the Associate status. Administrators have to produce visionary moves to elevate cricket as a serious sport in the USA. Else, it will just be a bit of fun for international cricketers looking for that U.S. vacay.",
    "summary": "The second edition of the U.S. Major League Cricket has concluded, with the Washington Freedom winning the tournament comfortably. International stars, including Pat Cummins and Steve Smith, participated in the tournament and had a great time. Despite the success of the tournament, the article notes that cricket still has a long way to go to gain traction in the US. Ricky Ponting, the head coach of the Freedom, emphasized the importance of developing cricket at the grassroots level, particularly among local kids. Efforts are underway to develop the sport, including the creation of a minor league and plans for a rookie league and age group tournaments. However, the article suggests that cricket is still largely an expat sport in the US and that more needs to be done to promote it to a wider American audience. The author suggests that cross-promotions with other popular sports like the NBA or NFL could help increase cricket's visibility in the US.",

    "body": "In this article, we will discuss the Top 5 All-Rounders You Can‚Äôt-Miss in MLC 2024. As Major League Cricket (MLC) 2024 approaches, the anticipation is building for an action-packed season featuring some of the best cricketing talents from around the world. Among these players, all-rounders are crucial as they provide balance and versatility to their teams. Here, we spotlight five all-rounders you can‚Äôt miss in MLC 2024.\n\nSunil Narine\n\nSunil Narine has been exceptional, particularly in the 2024 IPL where he was the highest-impact player of the tournament. With 488 runs at a strike rate of 180.7 and 17 wickets at an economy rate of 6.7, he was second-best only to Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nNarine‚Äôs versatility is invaluable, especially on the slightly sluggish pitches expected in America. He might be utilized as an opening batter, a role where he has found significant success for the Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nRead More: Which Top 5 Batters Will Dominate MLC 2024?\n\nAndre Russell\n\nAndre Russell, the dynamic West Indian all-rounder, was the standout performer for the Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR) last season. Despite the team‚Äôs overall struggles, Russell‚Äôs batting brilliance shone through with a strike rate close to 160 and an excellent average of 68, including two fifties.\n\nIn 2024, Russell has continued his form, boasting a batting average of around 43 and a phenomenal strike rate of 203.2 in 28 innings. Fresh off a title-winning campaign with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, Russell‚Äôs explosive hitting and useful bowling will be key for LAKR‚Äôs success in MLC.\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nWith a reputation for explosive batting, Glenn Maxwell entered IPL 2024 on fire, having accumulated 552 runs in 17 T20s since November 2023, with an average of 42.46 and a strike rate of 185.85, including two hundred. However, his IPL 2024 performance was underwhelming, scoring only 52 runs in 10 matches at an average of 5.78.\n\nDespite this, Maxwell remains a key figure for Washington Freedom in MLC 2024. His ability to change the game with both bat and ball makes him a critical component of the team.\n\nRachin Ravindra\n\nRachin Ravindra‚Äôs meteoric rise in international cricket has been nothing short of spectacular. After a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup, Ravindra was snapped up by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for INR 1.8 crore in the IPL.

Over the years, he has represented several franchises, including Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Pune Warriors India, and Rajasthan Royals (RR). One of the highlights of his IPL career was in 2017 when he led Rising Pune Supergiant to a high-voltage final. Smith was later named the captain of Rajasthan Royals before being released.

    "body": "Former Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has raised serious concerns following the conclusion of the second edition of Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024), which was won by the Washington Freedom after beating the San Francisco Unicorns in the final at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nGavaskar was in the US as part of the broadcast team for the recent Major League Cricket 2024 (MLC 2024), where he witnessed drastic changes. He has expressed his disappointment over the MLC‚Äôs overall quality, despite several international stars featured in the league.\n\nSunil Gavaskar criticizes Major League Cricket 2024 after witnessing a decline in standards and attendance\n\nThe former Indian captain highlighted a significant decline in the MLC‚Äôs standards compared to its inaugural season. He pointed out that the lackluster crowd turnout for the MLC 2024 was almost opposite to the enthusiastic attendance seen during the first edition of the tournament.\n\nEven Gavaskar has suggested a major overhaul to restore the tournament's prestige, including imposing restrictions on players' franchise T20 league involvement to maintain a higher level of competitive cricket and deliver world-class entertainment to the fans.\n\nSunil Gavaskar wrote in his column for The Sportstar: ‚ÄúFor some reason, the crowds were not quite there this time around. Maybe it was viewer fatigue because of the ICC T20 World Cup preceding the tournament. The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe because there were too many ordinary players there. The international stars who play in various T20 leagues around the world also seemed a little casual.‚Äù\n\nPlayers should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues: Sunil Gavaskar\n\nGavaskar suggested that players should be limited to participating in only three T20 leagues in the world to maintain the high standards and competitiveness of the franchise tournaments. He said that IPL is the world‚Äôs best league and nobody wants to leave it, so the players must be allowed to play in the other two leagues in the world.\n\nHe added, ‚ÄúWhile nobody wants the players‚Äô source of income to be curbed, I feel it is worth considering if players should be restricted to playing in three leagues of their choice. The IPL is the best and most competitive tournament because of the talent pool it attracts from all over the world. So, the player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice.‚Äù\n\nExplaining his point of view, Gavaskar pointed out that players often compete for one IPL franchise while representing a rival IPL team in other T20 leagues. This situation is understandable if the player's IPL team doesn't have a team in the other leagues, but it seems strange to see players wearing the jersey of a rival IPL team in these other leagues.\n\nGavaskar signed off by saying, ‚ÄúPlayers are playing for one franchise in the IPL and turning up for the rival IPL franchise in the other leagues. It is understandable if the franchise they compete for in the IPL doesn‚Äôt have a team in the other T20 leagues, but it is odd to see them wearing a jersey of a rival IPL franchise in other leagues.‚Äù",

    "date": "Sat Aug  3 04:14:00 2024",
    "body": "At a former baseball stadium in Dallas earlier this week, Australia's greatest male bowler and batter of their generation went head-to-head for the second time in four days.\n\nWhat shaped as a pair of captivating duels between Pat Cummins and Steve Smith hardly rated a mention in their home country as the Smith-captained Washington Freedom trumped Cummins' San Fransisco Unicorns in the Major League Cricket (MLC) finals.\n\nDespite Smith's match-winning hand of 88 off 52 balls in the tournament decider at the same Grand Prairie ground that hosted the T20 World Cup opener in June, Cummins maintained a little-known hold over his Test vice-captain in both the decider and a preceding qualifying final.\n\nIn the four T20 matches in which Smith has faced up to his long-time teammate, Cummins has dismissed him each time. Their head-to-head record stands at 4 wickets for 8 runs from 13 balls across their four encounters in the IPL, and now the MLC.\n\nIt's a fact few fans down under will be aware of (nor seemingly was San Fransisco skipper Corey Anderson, who failed to bowl Cummins through the middle overs of the final's first innings while Smith ran rampant) because none of their previous T20 encounters have been in Australia. Nor have they played together in a domestic T20 down under.\n\nSo how has a two-year-old tournament held in a non-Test playing nation been able to achieve something Australia‚Äôs own T20 league has not?\n\n\"It's new ‚Äì being in America is obviously different to being in Australia, and having that experience is something players are really keen on having over here,\" Michael Klinger, the former first-class batter who is now the Washington Freedom general manager, told cricket.com.au.\n\n\"The other thing, which is pretty obvious, is it's a short tournament. It's a three-week tournament and players of that ilk, they're not coming for the money. They're coming for the experience. They don't need the money.\n\n\"This year was unique as well because the tournament was on the back of a World Cup which was played in America and the Caribbean, so lot of these players were already quite close to where we were playing.\"\n\nThe value of Australia‚Äôs star power aside, what this latest MLC campaign also revealed was how an increasing number of Australians are driving the fortunes of MLC.\n\nIt was a source of pride for Cricket NSW (CNSW) and Cricket Victoria (CV) that this year's finalists ‚Äì the only two (of six) MLC teams not affiliated with IPL ownership groups ‚Äì are basically extensions of their own high-performance programs.\n\nWashington Freedom are aligned with CNSW, where Klinger was until recently its head of male T20 cricket, while San Fransisco Unicorns have a similar partnership with CV, whose current general manager of cricket, Graham Manou, also attended the tournament.\n\nThe Washington and San Fransisco franchises are owned by Indian and Indian-American tech entrepreneurs, but CNSW and CV receive funding from the clubs in exchange for providing high-performance expertise and personnel.\n\nBoth teams' off-field staff are almost entirely made up of Australians. Ex-Test stars Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson are the team‚Äôs respective head coaches, complemented by Aussie support staff in Cameron White, Shawn Bradstreet (Washington), Ben Rohrer and Adam Griffith (San Fransisco). MLC's tournament director is Canberra-born Justin Geale, while San Fransisco's GM David White, CV's former head of community cricket, works with Manou in running the Unicorns.\n\nOf the 22 players who featured in the final on Monday morning (AEST), eight were Australian. A further eight took part in the competition. Travis Head was the tournament's most valuable player, while Smith was player of the match in the final.\n\nOn the flipside, many of San Fransisco and Washington's local American players had travelled to Australia during last summer's Big Bash.\n\n\"We made sure that they were exposed to the professionalism of high-level cricket, which not all of them had been exposed to, and play some games against high-quality opposition,\" said Klinger.\n\n\"To have them exposed to that no doubt has given us an advantage. Just from observing this tournament, it looks like at Washington Freedom and even San Francisco Unicorns, the local players have been the best in the competition.\"\n\nIn essence, the state associations are selling the success of Australian cricket.\n\nThat has not gone unnoticed; it is believed Cricket Australia is considering how it might have its own involvement in MLC, and there is an overriding desire to find tangible benefits for Australian cricket from the game‚Äôs growth in the USA, particularly ahead of cricket‚Äôs return to the Olympics at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\nMore immediately, that may come as soon as next month's KFC BBL overseas player draft, according to Klinger.\n\nA host of American players, including some who helped USA pull off their shock win over Pakistan that fired them into the T20 World Cup's Super Eights stage in June, will be up for grabs.\n\nAnderson, the former New Zealand international, featured for Hobart Hurricanes last season, but the likes of South Africa-born Andries Gous and former India U19 paceman Saurabh Netravalkar featuring in this summer's BBL would mark a step forward in the Australia-USA cricket relationship.\n\n\"I reckon there's going to be a few getting picked up,\" Klinger said. \"There's two in our team who I think (are good chances). Andries Gous a wicketkeeper-batsman who obviously did really well in the World Cup.\n\n\"Netravalkar ‚Äì he was the leading wicket-taker over here and did well in the World Cup as well, a left-arm bowler who can bowl with the new ball and bowl variations at the death. I thought Hassan Khan from the Unicorns, a left-arm orthodox bowler and left-hand middle-order batter, could provide a team with a great option as well.\n\n\"Teams would be crazy not to have a look at them, especially with the lack of high-end talent coming into the draft this year from overseas. I think having those guys at the middle to the lower levels will add a lot to some teams.\"\n\nDriving the growth of US cricket has been the country‚Äôs large population who have south-Asian heritage.\n\nThe sell-out MLC final in Dallas underlined that community‚Äôs strong interest in the game, as did the enormous demand for tickets for the ICC's showpiece World Cup moment, the India-Pakistan match at a 'pop-up' stadium in New York.\n\nPonting believes more still more can be done by both the MLC and the ICC to develop the game among young Americans.\n\n\"I think there's a still a role for the players and the franchises. I think the World Cup missed a trick as well in not promoting the game more at grassroots level, getting into schools,\" Ponting, a broadcast commentator during the World Cup, said before the MLC final.\n\n\"That's where I think the next stage and growth will come from. This generation of American cricket fans, we can't just sit back and hope that they're going to promote the game.\n\n\"I think the game needs to do what it can to get out amongst kids. Baseball is such a big game for youngsters here in the US ‚Ä¶ (but) you go to a baseball game, it's four hours, there's not a lot of excitement that happens. I think it's less than one home-run hit per game.\n\n\"If you look at it that way, compared to what an entertainment package of three hours of cricket can bring to a younger generation, that's the way we should be looking at trying to promote the game here.\"\n\nThose involved in recruiting the game‚Äôs best cricketers to their nascent league, are realistic about the road ahead, with Klinger pointing out next year‚Äôs international schedule may not be as kind to the competition.\n\nThe scarcity of viable venues ‚Äì this year‚Äôs MLC was played at just two, in Dallas and in Morrisville, North Carolina ‚Äì is another concern. There is also no women‚Äôs MLC, though the BBC has reported discussions on an American women‚Äôs league are in their infancy.\n\nFor the world‚Äôs best men‚Äôs players, however, the MLC offers advantages its competitors cannot.\n\nCummins spoke openly about how the Unicorns owners‚Äô links to Silicon Valley and the venture-capital industry was a major draw for him in signing a four-year deal with the team ‚Äì an unprecedented move for a current Australian Test captain.\n\nCummins and Fraser-McGurk's filmed Zoom call with Travis Bazzana, a former junior cricketer from Sydney who last month became the first Australian to be taken with the number one pick in the Major League Baseball draft, was another 'only in America' moment.\n\nAustralian cricketers' social media posts of playing golf at some of the world's best courses, attending MLB games, eating southern barbeque, and even going to a Morgan Wallen concert, were shrewd advertisements of a trip to the USA.\n\nIn this respect, Klinger is bullish that the MLC is ahead of England's soon-to-be-privatised Hundred competition. \"Players are choosing it over the Hundred at the moment,\" he said.\n\n\"Who knows what happens in the future, that could change. In an ideal world I'd love to have those two tournaments separated. Potentially with the privatisation of the Hundred, there may be some duplicate owners in both leagues, if that's IPL setups or other setups.\n\n\"A short tournament where they can have maximum impact certainly helps (the MLC's appeal). It's going to be key for MLC down the track not to get too greedy and start to play too many games and make the tournament go longer.\n\n\"If they do that the likelihood is the best overseas players might not want to come. We've got to find that balance of keeping the tournament quite short and sharp and attracting the best players.\"",
    "summary": "* The MLC tournament was held in the United States, with the Washington Freedom, led by Steve Smith, defeating the San Fransisco Unicorns, led by Pat Cummins, in the finals.\n* Despite being dismissed by Cummins in both the decider and a preceding qualifying final, Smith scored a match-winning 88 off 52 balls in the tournament decider.\n* The MLC has attracted top Australian cricketers, including Smith and Cummins, who are drawn to the short tournament format and the opportunity to gain experience playing in the United States.\n* The Washington Freedom and San Fransisco Unicorns teams have strong Australian connections, with many Australian players, coaches, and support staff involved in the teams.\n* The MLC has revealed an increasing number of Australians driving the fortunes of the tournament, with many Australian players performing well in the competition.\n* The success of the MLC has not gone unnoticed, with Cricket Australia considering how it might have its own involvement in the tournament.\n* The tournament has also led to opportunities for American players, with some expected to be picked up in the KFC BBL overseas player draft next month.\n* Ricky Ponting, the coach of the Washington Freedom, believes more can be done to develop the game among young Americans, and that the MLC and ICC need to promote the game more at a grassroots level.\n* The MLC faces challenges, including a limited number of viable venues and no women's competition, but its advantages, including its short tournament format and opportunities for players to gain experience in the United States, make it an attractive option for top cricketers.",

The cricket was also not of the same high quality as last year. Maybe, because there were too many ordinary players there.

So maybe a player should be restricted to the IPL and two other leagues of his choice.\"\n\nInterestingly, Gavaskar's comments come soon after a meeting between the BCCI and IPL team owners, at which the franchise owners sought to crack down on overseas players pulling out of the tournament despite being picked in the auction, reportedly suggesting a two-year ban if they pull out without a good reason (injury or international/family commitments).\n\nWhat are the existing restrictions in place?\n\nFranchise T20 leagues have been in the spotlight recently, as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) denied no-objection certificates to centrally-contracted players Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afridi to take part in the Global T20 league in Canada. Saim Ayub and Azam Khan have also not been given NOCs for the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nThe PCB has a formal policy written into players' central contracts, that they are allowed to play only in the Pakistan Super League, and two further franchise leagues in a given season.\n\nThe BCCI is another board that imposes restrictions on its players. India men's players are not allowed to participate in overseas franchise T20 leagues, unless they retire and forego the chance to participate in the IPL. However, India women's players have taken part in the Women's Big Bash League, the Women's Hundred and Women's Caribbean Premier League, to name a few.\n\nThe reason for this policy is believed to be that the presence of Indian players in the IPL makes it unique, and increases the value of the product overall. Most other cricket boards do not place such blanket restrictions on their players.\n\nThere have been increasing calls of late for a governing body such as the ICC, to introduce centralised regulations for franchise T20 leagues to ensure better coordination and manage players' workloads and movements better.",

    "title": "MLC vs The Hundred - Which Competition Has The Better Overseas Players?",
    "date": "Fri Aug  2 12:10:00 2024",
    "body": "The overlap between the two competitions has caused significant disruption in the overseas player marker, with several marquee names not available for the start of The Hundred.\n\nMajor League Cricket: New kid on the block, but an attractive option\n\nAlthough the MLC is only in its second season, it has a huge volume of high profile international names on its roster. The most notable of these this season was Pat Cummins, who announced he would captain San Francisco Unicorns ahead of the tournament for its entirety, and on a multi-year basis until 2027. This was a significant coup for the youngest franchise league on the circuit to snap up the Australia captain, but also a blow for The Hundred that its biggest rival was able to attract the biggest names in the world.\n\nThe overseas names in MLC are second only to the IPL. To name just a few of the regulars on the franchise circuit who played in the tournament this year, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Trent Boult, Dwayne Bravo and Glenn Maxwell are some of the most well-known.\n\nHowever, where MLC has overtaken the Hundred is in its ability to attract either centrally contracted overseas players who are limited in the number of franchise tournaments they play. For example, South Africa players Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada and Heinrich Klaasen all picked up stints in the MLC. As did Australia's Alex Carey, Marcus Stoinis, Steve Smith and Travis Head.\n\nHaving multiple such high profile names in a squad means even below the elite level, the pool of overseas players is deep. For The Hundred, that does not exist this year. Several of the most high profile names dropped out before the tournament began. Shaheen Shah Afridi was set to play in the competition but withdrew at the beginning of the summer. The same happened with Naseem Shah as the PCB tighten their NOC regulations. With fewer international heavy weights and the overseas players beneath them short on star quality, there's no doubt the MLC overseas roster is far superior.\n\nWhy does The Hundred lag behind MLC?\n\nThere is a significant overlap of players who played in the MLC also playing in The Hundred once their obligations in the USA are fulfilled. Rashid Khan flew over after the conclusion of the MLC to reprise his place in Trent Rockets' squad. Adam Zampa did similar. But, in the gap before the highest profile names flew over, the tournament was notably less competitive.\n\nThere are several reasons why The Hundred has fallen so far off MLC in terms of overseas players. Firstly, the rules of MLC are specifically designed to bring in top quality talent from overseas, with cricket still a minority sport in the USA. Each franchise can have up to nine overseas players, with a maximum of six in an XI.\n\nFor The Hundred, only three overseas players are allowed in a squad. Not only is there simply more space for overseas players, but as more names join the competition, the quality of the cricket is guaranteed to be better with marquee players often making up more than half of each side.\n\nThe spectre of the IPL looms large\n\nThe IPL factor is also important. Four of the six MLC teams are owned by franchises with teams in the IPL. Players with contracts in one competition to a franchise with a presence in another have an easier way-in to a competition than those who don't. They can also go lengths to securing their place in another franchise competition they want to play in, like the IPL through playing for a franchise with a team in that league in a competition like MLC.\n\nIn many ways, particularly looking at the advances of competitions like the SA20 and MLC, franchise competitions who do not have some element of IPL team ownership are rapidly falling behind.\n\nRead more: Five uncapped players who England could pick for the Australia white-ball series\n\nThe timing of MLC this year also could not have been more perfect to attract the biggest names. With the T20 World Cup held in the Caribbean, it was a convenient hop over after the end of the tournament. There's also been a lack of international cricket outside of the England v West Indies Tests, meaning most players could afford to pick up a paycheque in a league before rejoining their national squads.\n\nWith the perfect conditions created this year for a tidal wave of overseas stars to add glitz to MLC, it's left The Hundred in a difficult position playing catch-up.",

    "body": "The owners of Chennai Super Kings also own Joburg Super Kings in the SA20 League and the Texas Super Kings in the Major League Cricket. Usually, they try to find a common batch of cricketers who represent them in all these leagues. Hence, if they have signed a player for one tournament, more often than not, this player will also be targeted for their squad in another league. On that note, here, we take a look at the list of two new Joburg Super Kings players whom CSK should target for IPL 2025.\n\n1) Jonny Bairstow\n\nJonny Bairstow was a big move by JSK for SA20 2025. With Reeze Hendricks not doing so well, the team had to work on the top order. They had retained Faf du Plessis and now, they have pulled off a coup by partnering Jonny Bairstow with him at the top of the order.\n\nJonny is an excellent T20 cricketer and would straightaway add value to the side. He has loads of experience and on his day, he could easily win a game for his side. Therefore, CSK should also target the cricketer and also because he can keep wickets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Tabraiz Shamsi\n\nTabraiz Shamsi is one of the new Joburg Super Kings players whom CSK should target for IPL 2025. It has been a while since CSK has had a good leg-spinner in the side. The last option they had was Imran Tahir and it was quite a few years ago. For the pitch at Chepauk, a good leg-spin option is a must.\n\nJSK executed a brilliant trade by bringing Shamsi to the franchise. Along with Imran Tahir, he would form a brilliant partnership in the spin department. Shamsi can surely weave his magic at a venue like Chepauk. He offers variety, as well. The South African cricketer is a passionate man and would be a top choice for CSK, too.",
    "summary": "The article mentions the Texas Super Kings, a team in the Major League Cricket (MLC) tournament, which is owned by the same owners as Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Joburg Super Kings in the SA20 League. The owners often try to find common players who can represent them in all three leagues. The article does not provide any further information about the MLC tournament, such as its schedule, format, or recent developments. It only mentions the Texas Super Kings in the context of the common ownership with CSK and Joburg Super Kings.",

In desperate need of a strong start, the Unicorns faltered early. Jake Fraser-McGurk (3) was dismissed in the third over, and Marco Jansen delivered a crucial blow by removing Finn Allen (13), who had scored a century in the qualifier. At 30/3, the Unicorns were in deep trouble.\n\nThe middle-order collapse continued with Sherfane Rutherford (4) and Josh Inglis (18) falling early, dashing any hopes of a miraculous chase. Andrew Tye, brought in for the final, picked up two pivotal wickets, tightening the noose around the Unicorns. Rachin Ravindra then finished the job with an impressive spell, ending with figures of 3/23.\n\nEarlier in the match, Washington Freedom had lost Travis Head (9) early. Steve Smith (88) then took center stage, anchoring the innings with a masterful knock. He found support from Andries Gous (21), who added a steadying partnership before both Gous and Rachin Ravindra (11) fell without making significant contributions. Undeterred, Smith unleashed a barrage of strokes, easily finding the boundary.\n\nGlenn Maxwell (40) joined Smith, and the duo took the game away from the Unicorns with their aggressive batting. A memorable over saw Drysdale concede 28 runs as Smith and Maxwell went berserk, setting the stage for a massive total.\n\nSmith‚Äôs departure, followed shortly by Maxwell‚Äôs, brought Mukhtar Ahmed (19*) to the crease, who contributed a quick cameo with a couple of big hits, pushing the total past the 200-mark. Washington Freedom ended their innings at 208, a record total for a final.\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nWashington Freedom (Steve Smith 88, Glenn Maxwell 40, Pat Cummins 2/35) defeated San Francisco Unicorns (Carmi Le Roux 20, Josh Inglis 18, Marco Jansen 3/28) by 96 runs.",

It was a clinical performance as we won both our Qualifier and Championship matches to cap off a memorable season.\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at some of the major highlights for the Freedom squad this season.\n\nThe Aussie Flavour\n\nHead coach Ricky Ponting and assistant coach Cameron White took over the coaching duties at the start of the season. The signings of captain Steve Smith, Travis Head, and Glenn Maxwell, along with the coaching duo, brought the competitive edge that Australia possesses in international cricket.\n\nThe results were evident as the Aussies contributed significantly to our campaign, and we won seven out of nine matches in the entire season, with one match being abandoned due to rain.\n\nConsistent Performances\n\nFreedom showed consistency right from the get-go, making it to the Playoffs in both seasons. We finished third in the points table in MLC 2023 before losing to MI New York in the Eliminator.\n\nIn MLC 2024, we took a step forward by finishing at the top of the points table and won the Championship against the San Francisco Unicorns, demonstrating a marked improvement in our performance.\n\nPerfect start in the league stage\n\nWe had an excellent start to our MLC 2024 campaign, winning 5 of our first six matches in the league phase, with one match being abandoned due to rain. This helped us race off the blocks quickly, giving us the winning momentum and making us the first team to qualify for the Playoffs.\n\nThe convincing margins of our victories also ensured that we finished at the top of the points table with a better net run rate, although the San Francisco Unicorns also finished level on points with us. The top-two finish also gave us the chance to directly qualify for the Championship match by winning the Qualifier.\n\nSmith and Head: The Run Machines\n\nSteve Smith and Travis Head were in top form in MLC 2024, scoring more than half of our total runs this season. A majority of our large wins owed to the brilliant starts provided by the opening duo during the powerplay. Both batters had a breakthrough season this year finishing joint-second in the overall batting charts with 300-plus runs.\n\nSmith amassed 336 runs from nine matches at an excellent average of 56.00 and a strike rate of 148.67 whereas Head also tallied 336 runs from as many matches at an average of 48.00 and an astonishing strike rate of 173.19.\n\nTravis Head‚Äôs 5-consecutive fifties\n\nTravis Head had a dream debut season in Major League Cricket with the Freedom squad. Though the southpaw started slowly getting a meagre 33 runs from his first three matches, his next five matches produced a mammoth 294 runs, including five fifties, at a mind-boggling average of 73.50 and a strike rate of 176.05.\n\nIn the process, Head also created a breathtaking record in MLC, a run of five consecutive fifties, a feat which no batter has managed in the tournament. The last of those knocks saw him smash an unbeaten 77 off just 44 balls against the Unicorns in the Qualifier, Head‚Äôs highest score in the MLC.\n\nTravis Head, deservedly, finished as the Player of the Tournament in our victorious MLC 2024 campaign.\n\nBowling in partnership\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar finished as the highest wicket-taker in MLC 2024 with 15 wickets from only seven matches at an average of 13.46 and a strike rate of 10.53. But what impressed more was the performance of the supporting cast consisting of Rachin Ravindra, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell, all finishing with a tally of 10 or more wickets.\n\nRavindra‚Äôs left-arm spin accounted for 12 wickets from six innings at an unbelievable average of 6.08 and a strike rate of 7.58. The Kiwi took two four-wicket hauls and his 4/11 against the Unicorns in the Qualifier were the best bowling figures, both in his T20 career as well as in MLC 2024.\n\nMarco Jansen was impressive with the new ball providing crucial breakthroughs for us throughout the competition. He ended the MLC 2024 with 11 wickets from eight matches striking under every 17 balls he bowled.\n\nJansen‚Äôs three wickets in both the Qualifier as well as the Championship prevented the Unicorns‚Äô big-hitting top order from breaking free and restricted them to modest totals.\n\nGlenn Maxwell and Lockie Ferguson also finished with 10 wickets each from eight and seven matches respectively to round off an excellent bowling performance for us this season.\n\nThough Jasdeep Singh and Andrew Tye played only two matches for us in MLC 2024, they shone in the limited opportunities they had by picking up six and five wickets, respectively. Jasdeep finished as the Player of the Match in both matches he played during the season, with impressive three-wicket hauls in each.\n\nThe three-dimensional players\n\nGlenn Maxwell and Rachin Ravindra provided depth and balance to the side with their multifaceted skill sets. Both players could change games with the bat, ball or with their fielding.\n\nApart from his bowling exploits, Maxwell accumulated 153 runs from five innings at an average of 38.25 and a sensational strike rate of 164.51. His game-changing knock of 54 off just 23 balls against the Unicorns in the Qualifier showcased his big-hitting prowess.\n\nRavindra scored 99 runs in the tournament at a strike rate of 137.50, his whirlwind knock of 31 off 14 balls, which included 20 runs from a Trent Boult over, against the MI New York being his best effort.\n\nBoth were gun fielders too, taking crucial catches and saving important runs.",

Smith hit six sixes and seven boundaries during his innings to guide us to our first title in MLC.\n\nThis is also the highest individual score for us in the history of MLC as Smith went past Matthew Short‚Äôs score of 80 scored against TSK last season.\n\nTop Run-scorer\n\nSteve Smith and Travis Head, with 336 runs from nine matches, were the joint highest run-scorers for us in the MLC 2024 finishing second in the overall batting charts.

Jasdeep Singh shone with the ball on his MLC debut picking up 3/14 to restrict MINY as we won the game by 94 runs.\n\nMarco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson and Glenn Maxwell also picked up two wickets apiece in an all-round bowling performance. This was also MINY‚Äôs lowest total in the MLC.\n\nHighest Wicket-taker\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar finished on top of the overall bowling charts in MLC 2024 with 15 wickets from just seven matches at an average of 13.46 and a strike rate of 10.53. The left-arm pacer‚Äôs best bowling effort of 4/35, this season, came against Los Angeles Knight Riders during our eight-wicket win.\n\nNetravalkar was also our top wicket-taker last season with 10 wickets from six matches.\n\nRachin Ravindra is second on the overall list with 12 wickets from six innings at an unbelievable average of 6.08 and a strike rate of 7.58.\n\nBest Bowling in an innings\n\nRavindra‚Äôs magical spell of 4/11 in the Qualifier match against the Unicorns is the best bowling figures recorded for us this year.

The duo hit nine fours and five sixes during their time together at the crease to provide us our first century partnership in MLC.\n\nBut unfortunately, we ended up on the losing side of the content as the Unicorns won by six wickets.\n\nLargest victory margin\n\nThe 96-run win over the Unicorns in the Championship of the MLC 2024 is our biggest victory margin by runs this year.\n\nBatting first, we posted 207/5 on the board with captain Steve Smith top-scoring with a 52-ball 88. In response, the Unicorns could manage only 111 as Ravindra and Jansen picked up three wickets each.\n\nThe eight-wicket win over LAKR during the league phase is our biggest victory in terms of wickets this season. Netravalkar and Maxwell got four and three wickets respectively as Travis Head shone with the bat with a 32-ball 54.\n\nHighest Batting average and strike rate\n\nSteve Smith, averaging 56.00, has the best average, second overall, for us in MLC this season. Out of the nine innings he has batted, Smith has scored 336 runs, including three fifties, and has remained unbeaten on three occasions. He reserved his best for the last as he top-scored in the Final with 88 off 52 balls to help us beat the Unicorns.\n\nMeanwhile, Travis Head has the best strike rate among our batters who have scored a minimum of 100 runs this season. Head amassed 336 runs this season at an excellent strike rate of 173.19.

Head leads the overall chart for most fifties in MLC 2024 with five from nine matches. Smith is second on our list with three fifties from the same number of matches.\n\nMost sixes and sixes in an innings\n\nWith 21 sixes from nine matches, Steve Smith is our highest six-hitter, and second overall, this season. Smith and Head, with six sixes each, together share the spoils for the most sixes hit in an innings.\n\nMeanwhile, Head leads the boundary count with a total of 40 fours from nine matches. The southpaw also holds the record for most fours scored in an innings for us with 10 fours in his unbeaten knock of 77 off just 44 balls against the Unicorns in the Qualifier match.\n\nBest Bowling average, economy and strike rate\n\nRachin Ravindra has the best bowling average in MLC 2024 with an average of 6.08 runs for every wicket picked up. The left-arm spinner ended with a total of 12 wickets from seven matches in this campaign conceding only 73 runs.\n\nRavindra also heads the charts for the best economy rates among bowlers in MLC this year. He has sent down a total of 15.1 overs in the tournament at a miserly economy rate of 4.81 runs an over.\n\nAmong bowlers who have sent down a minimum of 10 overs in MLC this year, Ravindra heads the list of best strike rates too with an impressive frequency of 7.58 balls per wicket. His total tally of 12 wickets came in just 91 balls.\n\nAndrew Tye and Jasdeep Singh with 6.00 and 7.00, respectively, have better strike rates but have bowled only five and seven overs each.\n\nMost Catches\n\nMukhtar Ahmed tops our list of most catches by an outfield player with seven catches from nine matches. He is also third on the overall list in MLC 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Mukhtar and Ferguson share the honours for most catches in a single match with three each against TSK and MINY, respectively.",
